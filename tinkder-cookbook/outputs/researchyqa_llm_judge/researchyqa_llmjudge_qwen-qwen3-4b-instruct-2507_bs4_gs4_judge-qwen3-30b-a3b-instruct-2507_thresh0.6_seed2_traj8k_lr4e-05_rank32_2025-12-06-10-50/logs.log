[0m[32m<Middle> Mondrian was a key figure in the development of De Stijl, a movement that emphasized simplicity, geometric forms, and primary colors. While he was influenced by Cubism, especially in its use of geometric forms and fragmentation of space, he ultimately moved beyond Cubism to develop a more purified and universal aesthetic. Mondrian viewed Cubism as a transitional phase that helped break down traditional forms, but he felt it was still too complex and subjective. He believed that De Stijl, with its focus on balance, harmony, and universal principles, represented a more advanced and emotionally pure art. In essence, Mondrian saw Cubism as a stepping stone toward the spiritual and abstract ideals of De Stijl. </Middle>
