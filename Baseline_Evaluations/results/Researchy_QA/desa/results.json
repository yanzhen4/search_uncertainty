It established a quota system. This set a limit on how many immigrants from each country could enter the US every year. The Quota System made it so only 2% of a county's population could enter the US as immigrants each year. This mainly was to limit European immigration, and was successful in limiting immigration except from Mexico and Canada. During the 1920’s only about 38,000 Asian came into the United States.\nWhen the Immigrants got into America, most settled down and tried to find jobs. But employers wouldn’t give “aliens” jobs because they wanted true born Americans instead of “undesirable” immigrants.\nWhen the Immigrants got into America, most settled down and tried to find jobs.

For more information, please see the full notice.\nThe Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act)\nIntroduction\nThe Immigration Act of 1924 limited the number of immigrants allowed entry into the United States through a national origins quota. The quota provided immigration visas to two percent of the total number of people of each nationality in the United States as of the 1890 national census. It completely excluded immigrants from Asia.\nLiteracy Tests and “Asiatic Barred Zone”\nIn 1917, the U.S. Congress enacted the first widely restrictive immigration law. The uncertainty generated over national security during World War I made it possible for Congress to pass this legislation, and it included several important provisions that paved the way for the 1924 Act. The 1917 Act implemented a literacy test that required immigrants over 16 years old to demonstrate basic reading comprehension in any language. It also increased the tax paid by new immigrants upon arrival and allowed immigration officials to exercise more discretion in making decisions over whom to exclude. Finally, the Act excluded from entry anyone born in a geographically defined “Asiatic Barred Zone” except for Japanese and Filipinos. In 1907, the Japanese Government had voluntarily limited Japanese immigration to the United States in the Gentlemen’s Agreement. The Philippines was a U.S. colony, so its citizens were U.S. nationals and could travel freely to the United States. China was not included in the Barred Zone, but the Chinese were already denied immigration visas under the Chinese Exclusion Act.\nImmigration Quotas\nThe literacy test alone was not enough to prevent most potential immigrants from entering, so members of Congress sought a new way to restrict immigration in the 1920s. Immigration expert and Republican Senator from Vermont William P. Dillingham introduced a measure to create immigration quotas, which he set at three percent of the total population of the foreign-born of each nationality in the United States as recorded in the 1910 census. This put the total number of visas available each year to new immigrants at 350,000. It did not, however, establish quotas of any kind for residents of the Western Hemisphere. President Wilson opposed the restrictive act, preferring a more liberal immigration policy, so he used the pocket veto to prevent its passage. In early 1921, the newly inaugurated President Warren Harding called Congress back to a special session to pass the law. In 1922, the act was renewed for another two years.\nWhen the congressional debate over immigration began in 1924, the quota system was so well-established that no one questioned whether to maintain it, but rather discussed how to adjust it. Though there were advocates for raising quotas and allowing more people to enter, the champions of restriction triumphed. They created a plan that lowered the existing quota from three to two percent of the foreign-born population. They also pushed back the year on which quota calculations were based from 1910 to 1890.\nAnother change to the quota altered the basis of the quota calculations. The quota had been based on the number of people born outside of the United States, or the number of immigrants in the United States. The new law traced the origins of the whole of the U.S. population, including natural-born citizens. The new quota calculations included large numbers of people of British descent whose families had long resided in the United States. As a result, the percentage of visas available to individuals from the British Isles and Western Europe increased, but newer immigration from other areas like Southern and Eastern Europe was limited.\nThe 1924 Immigration Act also included a provision excluding from entry any alien who by virtue of race or nationality was ineligible for citizenship.

Existing nationality laws dating from 1790 and 1870 excluded people of Asian lineage from naturalizing. As a result, the 1924 Act meant that even Asians not previously prevented from immigrating – the Japanese in particular – would no longer be admitted to the United States. Many in Japan were very offended by the new law, which was a violation of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. The Japanese government protested, but the law remained, resulting in an increase in existing tensions between the two nations. Despite the increased tensions, it appeared that the U.S. Congress had decided that preserving the racial composition of the country was more important than promoting good ties with Japan.\nThe restrictive principles of the Act could have resulted in strained relations with some European countries as well, but these potential problems did not appear for several reasons. The global depression of the 1930s, World War II, and stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration policy served to curtail European emigration. When these crises had passed, emergency provisions for the resettlement of displaced persons in 1948 and 1950 helped the United States avoid conflict over its new immigration laws.\nIn all of its parts, the most basic purpose of the 1924 Immigration Act was to preserve the ideal of U.S. homogeneity. Congress revised the Act in 1952.\nDoc 4(Title: \"What congressional act abolished the quota system for ...\") LexingtonAbogado.com\nThis domain is for sale: $2,895\nBuy now for $2,895 or pay $120.63 per month for 24 months\nThis domain is for sale: $2,895\n-\nEnjoy zero percent financing\n-\nQuick delivery of the domain\n-\nSafe and secure shopping\nSince 2005, we've helped thousands of people get the perfect domain name\nEasy to follow the steps to manage my domain.\n- Eric Kuan, November 27, 2024Very easy, step-by-step instructions to purchase a domain.

Racial discrimination has always been a serious social problem. Racial discrimination is further convinced that the disaggregated differences are linked to hierarchical evaluations, and that various human races determine their culture or personal achievement, implying that certain races are better than others. Racism to the German Nazi regime and the United States as the representation of the past, the German Nazi regime\nThe United States is considered one of the countries that have more immigrants in the world. Also, is considered as one of the countries that treat their population equally. According to Teresa Welsh, in 2013 North America has 989,900 immigrants, leading the U.S to be the top country for having more migrants. However, immigrants are facing discrimination and racism in this country.\nIntroduction Racial discrimination is defined as “when a person is treated less favorably than another person in a similar situation because of their race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin or immigrant status” (Thomas). Racial discrimination in the workplace is a real problem in our world today. Not only is it against the Constitution, but it is morally and ethically wrong. Throughout history, many people have fought for equality among races, and the fact that racism is still an issue in our country today is proof that the United States still has a lot to change. Racism is an issue that has been going on in our country since slavery first began in the United States in 1619 (Slavery). That’s over 400 years ago. Racism is prevalent in many workplaces, and those who are in the minority experience inequality through payment, promotion, and treatment.\nThe more we comprehend our self, our social location and the nature and history of power, oppression, and prejudice, the more we will be able to identify and react racism and discrimination when we see it. The harsh truth is that racism is something we learn not something we were born with, it’s very serious issues and shouldn’t be ignored, we should never try and hide our identity in fear of being discriminated, the good news is that no matter where we are there will always be support for us. Just make sure we look in the right places.\nSo here are the facts: According to national poll commissioned by the Episcopal Church 98% of Americans feel that there is some type of discrimination still alive in America today. 7/10 Americans feel that African Americans are directly discriminated against. But it can happen to anyone whichever race. Journal Science states that “Many people unconsciously harbor racist attitudes. But is that an excuse for hostility?\nAfrican-Americans are using drugs less than Caucasian, but amazingly are 6 times more likely to be stopped and searched for them.The drug percentage is about 5.8% for African-Americans and 10.5% for caucasians, and the search rate is 45/1000 African-American and 7/1000 caucasians. Many people are still being racist and because of color, a style, sexual orientation, or what you may have. You're put in a group classified on these things and are judged on by the world. Racism and discrimination is happening and it needs to stop. From Jobs, stereotypes, and the system, racism and discrimination still live.\nI: People from different backgrounds around the world are being targeted and discriminated by individuals of other races solely because they are different racially and culturally.\nCivil rights activist Al Sharpton said, “We have come a long way from the days of slavery, but in 2014, discrimination and inequality still saturate our society in modern ways”. This quote rings true where equality in the workplace is concerned. In Toni Cade Bambara’s short story “The Lesson”, we see what social discrimination looks like through the eyes of children who are observing a wealthier part of town. In their eyes, they see and injustice and question why it is not being altered into something centered more on equality and equal opportunity.

Second, creative intelligences (i.e., originality, fine arts, etc.) and third, social intelligence (i.e., social perceptiveness, negotiation, persuasion, and assisting and caring for others).\n- The analysis reveals two waves of computerization. First, labor is likely to be substituted by computer capital in transportation and logistics occupations, ofﬁce and administrative support work, and production occupations. Second, as the computational bottleneck is overcome, additional jobs could be replaced with computer capital.\n- The current trend of labor market polarization to extremely low-paying and extremely high-paying jobs will be truncated. The demand for middle-income occupations will not continue indefinitely: The study predicts that computerization will replace low-skill, low-wage jobs, while high-skill and high-wage occupations are the least susceptible to being replaced.\n“Our ﬁndings thus imply that as technology races ahead, low-skill workers will reallocate to tasks that are nonsusceptible to computerization — i.e., tasks requiring creative and social intelligence,” Frey and Osborne write. “For workers to win the race, however, they will have to acquire creative and social skills.”\nKeywords: technology, economy\nDoc 4(Title: \"Computerization jobs and the future: Research views on ...\") The effects of outsourcing and offshoring have long been the chief focus of stories about U.S. labor market disruption, but in recent years the speed and power of technology itself has increasingly been singled out. For example, the social networking site Facebook recently bought the mobile messaging service WhatsApp for a staggering $16 billion cash and stock. The acquired company had a staff of 55 employees. Some commentators see this as a sign of things to come, and the trend of lean-staffed, technologically advanced business is not limited to Web-based services. Everywhere service employees like cashiers are being replaced by self-service terminals and professionals such as accountants by software — even taxi drivers face the looming prospect of Google’s driverless car.\nThis trend is anything but new, as technological innovation has always tended to make certain jobs obsolete. Frank Seth Levy of MIT and Richard J. Murnane of Harvard note that, since 1960, “well-paid manual and clerical jobs have been computerized or offshored to other countries, while jobs calling for human ingenuity to solve unstructured problems proliferate.” Many societies accept job-displacement costs in exchange for the gains in efficiency and productivity, and grow new industries into which workers can move. But could things be different this time, as productivity radically accelerates? “Until now the jobs most vulnerable to machines were those that involved routine, repetitive tasks,” a January 2014 article in the Economist states, “But thanks to the exponential rise in processing power and the ubiquity of digitized information (‘big data’), computers are increasingly able to perform complicated tasks more cheaply and effectively than people.” Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of MIT argue that we should be relatively optimistic about this “third industrial revolution”: They assert that there will be a “world of benefits” as humanity harnesses digital technology and changes the way labor functions, but acknowledge that there will be considerable disruption in the short term.\nPrecisely how disruptive might these changes be in the coming decade or so? A 2013 study by Oxford University researchers, “The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerization?” analyzes U.S. Department of Labor statistics to calculate the probability of computerization of various jobs. The study, by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne, classifies 702 occupations according to the ease with which the required work can be specified by a computer programmer. The more “bottlenecks,” or barriers, to computerization, the less likely the occupation is to be automated. The research helps clarify which categories of jobs are most at risk and provides a framework for looking at particular skills and their value in the future.\nThe study’s findings include:\n- Among the job types analyzed, 47% fall are at a “high risk” of being computerized. Sectors particularly affected are service, sales and office administrative support. These are jobs, the researchers say, that “we expect could be automated relatively soon, perhaps over the next decade or two.” (Roughly speaking, the higher the probability of computerization, the sooner the particular job will be automated.)\n- Wages and education show a strong negative correlation with the probability of job computerization. In other words, jobs that pay more and require more education resist replacement by computers. (It is worth noting that other scholarship has long established these connections.)\n- There are three attributes (“engineering bottlenecks”) that make a job less likely to be computerized. First, perception and manipulation (i.e., finger/manual dexterity, the ability to work in cramped/awkward positions, etc.). Second, creative intelligences (i.e., originality, fine arts, etc.) and third, social intelligence (i.e., social perceptiveness, negotiation, persuasion, and assisting and caring for others).\n- The analysis\nDoc 5(Title: \"Causes of Poor Service Delivery in Africa and Their Impact ...\") Making sure you're not a bot!\nLoading...\nWhy am I seeing this?\nYou are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites.

More Affordable Housing\nOne of the most common reasons people move to the suburbs is affordability.\nIn many cities, housing prices and rent can be significantly higher than in nearby suburban areas.\nAdditionally, suburbs offer larger homes, more land, and often at a lower price per square foot, making them ideal for growing families or first-time homebuyers.\nYou may also like to read: Moving to a Bigger Home. In this guide, we examine the pros and cons, as well as alternatives, to moving to a larger home.\nYou may also like to compare what the cost of living is in the city compared with the suburbs using this tool at www.numbeo.com\n#2. More Space and Privacy\nCity apartments typically offer less living space, have shared walls, and are often located near one another.\nSuburban homes typically offer more space, both indoors and outdoors. Yards, driveways, and additional rooms provide greater comfort and privacy, which is perfect for families, remote workers, or anyone needing extra room.\n#3. Better Schools\nThe quality of education is a top priority for many families, and suburban public schools are often better funded and rated higher than their urban counterparts.\nThis makes the suburbs attractive to parents seeking strong academic opportunities for their children.\nYou may also like to read: How to Choose a Good School. In this guide, we suggest things to take into consideration when choosing a new school for your children.\n#4. Safer Neighborhoods\nSuburban areas tend to have lower crime rates compared to cities.\nObviously, not all suburbs are equal, but many offer better security and community vigilance, making them feel safer.\n#5. Access to Nature and Outdoor Activities\nLiving in the suburbs often means being closer to parks and green spaces. A suburban lifestyle supports a more outdoor-oriented and active way of life.\n#6. Less Noise and Pollution\nCities are known for being frantic and crowded, which often comes with noise, air pollution, and stress. The suburbs offer a quieter, cleaner environment, which can be beneficial to mental and physical health.\nYou may also like to read: Cheap Local Moving Options. In this guide, we suggest various ways that you can make the move from the city to the suburbs cheaper.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Panic Move To The Suburbs\") With Covid-19 hitting large cities the hardest, people have started looking to the suburbs.\nHeadlines like “Coronavirus Escape: To the Suburbs” in the New York Times, “Coronavirus: Americans flee cities for the suburbs” in USA Today, “Will the Coronavirus Make the Suburbs Popular Again?” in Architectural Digest suggest an impending mass exodus to suburbia.\nAnd according to some reports, more than a third of Americans are considering moving to less populated areas.\nHowever, other data suggests that the figures are a bit lower.\nA recent survey by apartment rental platform PropertyNest found that only 13.8% of people surveyed planned to move either out of state, out of the city, out of their borough, or into a new home within the city.\nIt’s also not only Americans who are falling in love with the suburbs. The same pattern can be seen in Canada and the UK, among other places.\nRegardless of how many people are actually moving, it’s clear there’s an increased desire to seek greener, less-Covid-y, pastures.\nAnd while suburbia may seem like a good idea given the current circumstances, long-term it’s probably worse for you.\nAs Amanda Mull warns in a recent Atlantic article: “fleeing a big city because of the pandemic is a bigger gamble than it might seem.”\n“Those who panic-move could soon find that the future of work and cities is far different from what they expected,” she wrote, explaining that banking on permanent remote working could be risky.\nFor example, Facebook has already made it clear it will slash workers’ pay if they move to a less expensive place. This cost-cutting tactic is common among employers whose workers retain their jobs when they move to cheaper areas.\nBut pay cuts aside, moving to a suburban community is also pretty bad for your physical and mental health.\nFirst, there’s the process of moving. Like childbirth, it’s easy to forget the pain when it comes to moving after you’ve done it but relocating can unbelievably taxing to your mental health.\nIn a New York Times article on the psychology of moving, Ronnie Greenberg, a Manhattan psychoanalyst explained, “Panic can really set in around your home and your apartment. It’s a matrix of safety, so moving is incredibly stressful and people don’t realize it.”\nA poll conducted last year by Yopa of 2,000 UK homeowners, found that 40% of people thought the process of moving house as the most nerve-wracking life event. More nerve-wracking than getting a divorce, having a baby, or starting a new job.\nAlso if you have children, the transition has been shown to negatively impact their emotional well-being.\nOne study in published in 2017 that looked at 14,775 children in the UK over period of years found that moving may have a detrimental impact on their subsequent mental health.\nAnother study published in 2015 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health found that kids who have moved five or more times during their childhood are three times more likely to experience mental health problems compared to those who stay in their hometowns. The researchers also found that moving was significantly more damaging to older children who have to leave behind friends and change schools.\n“Moving house can be a hugely stressful experience for the parents and the family as a whole as it can be associated with change in social environment and networks, and other aspects of the physical and social environment,” explained the study’s lead author Foteini Tseliou in an interview with Reuters.\nBut the challenges don’t stop after you’ve moved.\nHuman beings have an innate need to socialize with one another and even without Covid-19 the suburbs make it really hard to do that. It doesn’t matter if you just moved there or have lived there for years – their design is inherently isolating.\n''A culture of impersonality has developed in the suburbs by the way they're laid out,'' Jonathan Barnett, author of \"The Fractured Metropolis\" and former professor of regional planning at the University of Penns\nDoc 3(Title: \"Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Panic Move To The Suburbs\") just moved there or have lived there for years – their design is inherently isolating.\n''A culture of impersonality has developed in the suburbs by the way they're laid out,'' Jonathan Barnett, author of \"The Fractured Metropolis\" and former professor of regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, told The New York Times in 1999.\nThink pieces examining why we feel depressed in the suburbs point to the lack of well-defined spaces and natural order, as well as the added effort it takes to socialize when everything is so spread out.\nAs David Roberts writes in Vox: “The neighborhoods are made for cars, not kids. So kids stay inside playing Xbox, and families don't leave except to drive somewhere.”\nBut as studies have shown, repeated spontaneous contact is the key to making friends, especially as you get older.\nYet, repeated spontaneous contact is virtually impossible in the suburbs. Seriously, where are you gonna run into someone? The mall?\nPlus don’t forget it’s just naturally harder to keep up with friends as we age, no matter where we live.\nAll this compounded with the added stress of being in a new place without your usual support systems is bound to have knock-on effects.\nFor example, research shows that people who don’t have strong social connections are more anxious, lonely, and depressed.\nAnd according to one study in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, social isolation or the lack of social connection can increase mortality risk by 29% and 32%, respectively.\nBut it’s not only mental health that is negatively effected by living in the suburbs. Several studies have shown that suburban living has negative physical health consequences.\nOne study published in 2004 found that people who lived in areas where there’s more urban sprawl were more likely to be overweight and obese.\nAnother study published in the same year, found that people who lived in more spread out suburban communities also reported more chronic health problems, like high blood pressure, arthritis, headaches, and breathing difficulties, than those who live in urban areas.\nThis link remained significant even after the researchers controlled for factors like age, economic status, race, and local environment that might help explain the disparity.\nSo before you put that down payment on a three-bedroom house in a suburban cul-de-sac ask yourself: is it really worth it?\nDoc 4(Title: \"How women’s life-long experiences of being judged by their ...\") A key reason many organisations want to move their employees to open-plan workspaces is to encourage collaboration and improve communication. The assumption is that the increased visibility and access workers have to one another will ease the flow of information and enhance learning, well-being, and collegiality.\nResearch suggests that, in some circumstances, this can indeed be the outcome. But another study recently found exactly the opposite, with workers engaging in 73% fewer face-to-face interactions, along with a 67% increase in electronic communication.\nRead more: A new study should be the final nail for open-plan offices\nIt is not just face-to-face communication that becomes worse in open-plan offices. There are findings that satisfaction decreases, well-being is impacted, privacy decreases, and people become less friendly.\nOne undeniable aspect of open-plan offices is the increased exposure and access to others they offer. This is sometimes deemed a benefit - particularly because it increases opportunities to learn from, and network with, high-status colleagues. But our research suggests that being more visible may not be good for everyone.\nRead more: Get out of my face! We're more antisocial in a shared office space\nGender differences\nOur study in a large open-plan law firm in Auckland found that, although occupants generally liked this well designed work environment, there was a gender difference in the responses. Every survey respondent who specifically mentioned being visible, watched, observed, exposed or more accountable was a woman. The male occupants, it seems, were oblivious to their increased exposure. This difference in responses was especially striking since we did not set out to explore the gender effects of open-plan work spaces.\nIt wasn’t that all the women especially disliked being so exposed. In fact, being visible came up several times when they were describing positive aspects of the space, outlining how the open office improved their productivity. One lawyer said:\nOverall the effect on my productivity is positive - can always be seen, so always working unless nobody is around.\nAnother woman commented:\nKnowing that other people can see what I am doing also motivates me to be productive.\nBut this female lawyer was keenly aware of the downside of being so visible:\nI don’t like that sometimes it feels like people are judging you for not giving enough face time as everything is so visible. Back at [previous office] there was more of a motto of getting the work done in the time needed and then go home. Now, with open space, it feels more like a fish bowl and I have noticed more subtle pressure to stay later even if you don’t technically need to - based on looks some seniors, even from entirely different teams, give you.\nOther research looking at the effect of working in a glass open-plan, largely transparent office, revealed the unexpected outcome of women becoming hyper-aware of being continually observed and evaluated, just as we found. Women (but not men) in this study reported becoming more image conscious, changing the way they dressed, how and where they walked, and feeling exposed.\nWhy is this? Are women really being looked at more than their male colleagues?\nResearch into the male gaze and surveillance behaviour on nudist beaches suggests they are. But, whether they are or not, women are socialised, practically from birth, to believe they are being looked at.\nEvaluated on appearance\nThrough their life experiences and their exposure to media, women and girls learn that they are almost constantly being evaluated and appraised. Women are aware of being observed in a way that men are not, simply because their life experiences have routinely included instances of being looked at.\nEvery time a girl is told she is cute or pretty, or even described in gender-neutral, objective terms such as being tall, she is actually being told she is being looked at and assessed on her appearance. Boys are far more like\nDoc 5(Title: \"Reasons Why Laws Change - Year 12 Legal Studies\") anging values within the community for example the legalisation of abortion and the banning of smoking in pubs/clubs and in cars with minors.\nChanging community awareness:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community awareness. As a national community, we are much more informed today and aware of relevant issues largely due to the speed and efficiency of communication. As informed citizens, we put pressure on law makers to amend or introduce legislation in areas that we believe need to change. For example, Brodie's law was introduced in 2011 after a teenager ended her life due to bullying at a café where she worked. This law now makes it a serious crime (punishable by up to 10 years) to bully others in the workplace and holds spreads the responsibility of ending bullying.\nChanging Expectations of the Legal System:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to the change expectations towards our legal system. Years ago, laws were expected to regulate behaviour however people now expect the law to uphold individual rights as well as protect people from harm. As such, the law has needed to take a more active role to ensure that it remains relevant. Examples of these include online defamation, duty of care and negligence.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the documents provided, people move to the suburbs mainly for more affordable housing, more space and privacy, better schools, safer neighborhoods, access to nature and outdoor activities, and less noise and pollution.

Not only is much of this rich diet still common in Mexico today, it's spread around the world. Here's a look at some of what the ancient Mexica peoples ate:\nMaize (also called corn or mealies) was the staple grain of the Aztec empire. Maize has been domesticated for thousands of years, and it likely first came into common use in Mexico, spreading to the rest of the world from there. Mexico is still one of the world's top maize growing countries. Corn could be ground into flour and used to make tortillas (a sort of flat bread, sometimes used to wrap a filling to make tacos), tamales and even drinks. Corn has transformed the world perhaps more than any other food. Today it's used not only in food, including candy and of course feeding the cattle that is eaten, it's even used in things like sticky tape and making boxes.\nHow did all this food grow? Find out about Aztec farming here.\nAztec food also included beans and squash. Of course, maize and beans are still a cornerstone of the Mexican diet, a healthy combination especially if you're not eating a lot of meat.\nTo add to these three, the Mexicas (people of the Aztec Empire) ate chillies, tomatoes, limes, cashews, potatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and of course chocolate. The Mexicas domesticated bees for honey, and turkeys for meat and eggs, also dogs and duck. They hunted and fished as well, and used animals such as deer, rabbits, iguana, fish and shrimp for food. Even insects, such as grasshoppers and worms were harvested. These various types of meat made up only a very minor part of the Aztec food that was eaten.\nOne of the greatest gifts to the world from Mexico is chocolate. The cocoa bean was highly treasured in the Aztec Empire. In fact, the bean was used as a currency, as well as Aztec food. Or, in this case, drink.\nThe cocoa beans were used to make a thick chocolate drink, but far different than the hot chocolate we know today. Since they didn't use sugar, the Mexicas added peppers, corn meal and spices. A similar hot drink is still found in Mexico today with corn, known as atole.\nThough Columbus brought cocoa to Europe in the early 1500s, it was mostly ignored. Hernan Cortes was more interested, and substituted sugar and vanilla for the spices. It became a commercial success.\nThe word chocolate even comes from an Aztec/Mayan word chocolatl.\nChocolate actually may have played a part in the fall of the Aztec empire. The Aztecs believed that the god Quetzalcoatl brought the cocoa beans from the tree of life to give to man. Later, the god was banished. It seems that at first the Mexicas believed that Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquerer, was their returning god.\nThere are some excellent recipes available online.

And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") lly damaging industry, and aside from the fact it makes so many people who consume it sick, dairying affects people in another important way. When we overproduce milk we are being recklessly wasteful of land, water, feed and farmers’ time. Wouldn’t these vital resources be better used in the production of nutritious plant-based foods that are sustainable and essential for optimal health?\nInstead of situating these damaging animal-based industries among poor, underserved communities, often predominantly inhabited by people of color, wouldn’t it be better to grow healthful plant foods that can be made locally available? ‘Food deserts’ is a term commonly used for areas where affordable, healthful food is in short supply, but food justice activists instead talk about ‘food apartheid’, as this issue connects directly to a systemic racism inherent in the food system.\nThere is much that is damaging about the dairy industry, and that is before we even talk about the cows themselves.\nHow Are Cows Treated On Dairy Farms?\nCows are treated as though they are inanimate machinery – you turn on a tap and out comes the milk.\nAs we know, cows produce milk only when they are pregnant, as their breast milk is intended for their babies. Every day that pregnancy is delayed is a day’s loss of milk, and so pregnancy is not left to chance. Cows are artificially inseminated which involves one human hand entering the cow’s anus to manipulate her cervix into position while the other hand inserts a tube of semen into her vagina. Suddenly, milk doesn’t seem quite so wholesome, does it?\nWhen the babies are born, they are taken from their mothers so they don’t actually drink the milk that was made for them. Cows show extreme distress at this separation, often bellowing with grief as any mother would. Cows have been known to break out of farms and trek for miles in search of their calves, such is the strength of their determination and love. And spare a thought for the calves themselves. Newborns need their mothers, and yet they are taken forcibly, and either killed or isolated. Their mothers can only look on and cry out for this to stop but it will happen again and again, as that is the only way to keep the milk flowing.\nIn CAFOs, cows who are naturally grazing animals and have four distinct areas of their stomachs to help them digest grass, are denied access to pasture. They are also denied stimulation, and have nothing to do all day but stand, eat and be milked. And suffer. Standing around is not pain-free when you consider the prevalence of lameness on America’s dairy farms to be up to 55 percent.\nAnd there is an immense biological price to pay for being near-constantly pregnant while simultaneously milked. No wonder, cows break down when still so very young. When they can no longer produce as much milk as is demanded of them, they are trucked to slaughter. It’s not a problem for the farmer, as there are always plenty of female calves who can take the place of their mothers, until they too collapse under the emotional, psychological and physical strain of being a dairy cow.\nIs Dairy Farming Cruel?\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer physically. As well as lameness, there is a high incidence of clinical mastitis – a painful infection of the teats usually caused by bacteria transmitted during the milking process or through living in filthy surroundings. It is so common that it occurs in all dairy herds. Mastitis is extraordinarily painful, and each day, every day, the cows’ infected teats are inserted into machinery to have the milk drawn from them.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer psychologically. Cows are intelligent, sentient beings, with individual personalities, the ability to learn and display long-term memory. They even remember those who have handled them roughly. Cows have needs and desires, but in modern intensive farms they are afforded nothing that makes their lives worthwhile.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer emotion\nDoc 5(Title: \"Dairy Farming: What Is It? And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") What could be more natural than a fully grown weaned adult human being drinking the breast milk of a different species? When put like that, it does sound a little weird doesn’t it? So how did drinking cows’ milk become so normalised? It is natural? And why don’t we drink the milk of dogs or moose… or whales? After all, they produce milk for their young, too. As soon as you start to ask why we drink milk, a thousand more questions pop right up.\nHistory Of Dairy Farming\nHumans didn’t always drink the milk of another species. After childhood (which is when all other mammals stop drinking milk) our ancient ancestors simply couldn’t digest it, and even today most adults worldwide still do not produce the enzyme lactase which is needed to digest the milk sugar, lactose.\nHowever, most Europeans do have this gene, and this genetic change in homo sapiens came into being around 7,500 years ago. With the ability to actually digest the white stuff without getting sick, their health improved, largely for two reasons. First, it meant that communities were no longer quite so reliant on crops that could fail, and second, milk was less likely to harm them than their local contaminated water supplies.\nThe co-evolution of milk tolerance and dairy-farming went hand-in-hand until today when there are 264 million cows in dairy farms all over the world. And yet, almost 100 percent of people with Asian, African and Native American ancestry develop lactose intolerance by adulthood, while in Black communities, the incidence is over 70 percent. Those who do consume dairy can experience bloating, diarrhea and abdominal cramps, and they may not even know what is causing it.\nWhat’s going on? Why are there so many cows and so much milk when so few people can digest it? The answer can be found in the phrases ‘cash cow’ and ‘white gold’. That’s right. Milk is aggressively marketed to people, even though it makes them sick, because others make money from it.\nWhat Is a Dairy Farming?\nIt is utilising and exploiting the reproductive systems of cows (and less commonly sheep and goats), in order to mass produce a product that is sold for consumption.\nSo, why do we milk cows and not dogs or moose or whales? It has nothing to do with the taste or suitability of the product. It’s just that cows are bigger and so make more milk than dogs, and they are more easily domesticated than moose or whales. It really is that simple.\nHow a Dairy Farm Works\nCows don’t naturally produce milk. Like all mammals, they must first be made pregnant, and the breast milk their bodies make is intended to feed their young. To ensure near-constant production, farmed cows are repeatedly made pregnant through artificial insemination. They are selectively-bred for optimal milk yield, despite the toll it takes on the animals – painfully distended udders, teat infections and lameness are all commonplace in modern-day dairies. Still, we are never satisfied. We want every ounce of milk from each cow, and we cannot spare even a drop for the calf for whom the milk was made. Besides, it’s the milk we want, not the baby, and so the young animals are taken from their mothers soon after birth to stop them drinking that valuable liquid. Both mother and calf grieve for days at this devastating separation, as any parent and child would.\nThe newborn females may be taken and isolated inside a hutch. Unable to nuzzle their mothers or find comfort in a herd, they are all alone, often chained, and able only to stand up or lie down until they are old enough to be impregnated and milked.\nThe males obviously can’t produce milk and as they are the wrong breed to put on muscle for beef, farmers won’t waste feed on them. Instead they may be raised for veal, chained inside crates and kept permanently weak, so their flesh is pale and tender. Or they may be shot in the head on their very first day of life.\nIt’s a brutal regime.\nWhere Is Dairy Farming Most Common?\nIndia has the greatest number of dairy cows – around 61 mil\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nBased on the information provided, corn, or maize, was the staple grain of the Aztec empire.

Many Christians did, however, speak out against the atrocities and try to alleviate the natives’ sufferings.\n•Schools and hospitals: By 1820, there were 25 universities and 56 secondary schools, most started and run by monastic orders, as well as numerous hospitals.\n•Church and state: Church and state were united and controlled all facets of life. By 1805 Alexander von Humboldt estimated that in some provinces of Mexico the church directly or indirectly controlled 80 percent of the land.\n•Hierarchical society: Society was stratified with the Spanish-born Peninsulares at the top; their American-born children (Creoles) next, the “mixed-blood” mestizos next; the Indians and black slaves at the bottom. Church leadership drew mainly from the top tiers.\n•Church orientation: 500 years after the first Christian contact, the region is a strong Catholic center, with increasing numbers of Protestants.\nFirst Christian Missionaries\n•Who: Bernal Buyl, vicar apostolate and representative of Ferdinand and Isabella, and 12 other churchmen.\n•When: Columbus’s second voyage. Columbus was directed in May 1493 to convert the natives to Christianity and to establish a colony. The missionaries sailed with him that September, bringing equipment for a church (a gift from Queen Isabella).\n•Where: La Isabela, a settlement founded on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (located between Cuba and Puerto Rico).

TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n- Since 1750, the average amount of energy from the Sun either remained constant or decreased slightly3.\n- If a more active Sun caused the warming, scientists would expect warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere and a warming at the surface and lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are slowing heat loss from the lower atmosphere.\n- Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.\nReferences\n1.

The term is derived from the Greek dēmokratia, which was coined from dēmos (“people”) and kratos (“rule”) in the middle of the 5th century bce to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens.\nFundamental questions\nThe etymological origins of the term democracy hint at a number of urgent problems that go far beyond semantic issues. If a government of or by the people—a “popular” government—is to be established, at least five fundamental questions must be confronted at the outset, and two more are almost certain to be posed if the democracy continues to exist for long.\n(1) What is the appropriate unit or association within which a democratic government should be established? A town or city? A country? A business corporation? A university? An international organization? All of these?\n(2) Given an appropriate association—a city, for example—who among its members should enjoy full citizenship? Which persons, in other words, should constitute the dēmos? Is every member of the association entitled to participate in governing it? Assuming that children should not be allowed to participate (as most adults would agree), should the dēmos include all adults? If it includes only a subset of the adult population, how small can the subset be before the association ceases to be a democracy and becomes something else, such as an aristocracy (government by the best, aristos) or an oligarchy (government by the few, oligos)?\n(3) Assuming a proper association and a proper dēmos, how are citizens to govern? What political organizations or institutions will they need? Will these institutions differ between different kinds of associations—for example, a small town and a large country?\n(4) When citizens are divided on an issue, as they often will be, whose views should prevail, and in what circumstances? Should a majority always prevail, or should minorities sometimes be empowered to block or overcome majority rule?\n(5) If a majority is ordinarily to prevail, what is to constitute a proper majority? A majority of all citizens? A majority of voters? Should a proper majority comprise not individual citizens but certain groups or associations of citizens, such as hereditary groups or territorial associations?\n(6) The preceding questions presuppose an adequate answer to a sixth and even more important question: Why should “the people” rule? Is democracy really better than aristocracy or monarchy? Perhaps, as Plato argues in the Republic, the best government would be led by a minority of the most highly qualified persons—an aristocracy of “philosopher-kings.” What reasons could be given to show that Plato’s view is wrong?\n- Key People:\n- Pericles\n- Aung San Suu Kyi\n- Solon\n- Cleisthenes of Athens\n- Ephialtes\n(7) No association could maintain a democratic government for very long if a majority of the dēmos—or a majority of the government—believed that some other form of government were better. Thus, a minimum condition for the continued existence of a democracy is that a substantial proportion of both the dēmos and the leadership believes that popular government is better than any feasible alternative. What conditions, in addition to this one, favour the continued existence of democracy? What conditions are harmful to it? Why have some democracies managed to endure, even through periods of severe crisis, while so many others have collapsed?\nDoc 5(Title: \"Spread of Democracy\") tubbornly persisted for all strongman power. The notions of uber alles, Xi Thought, draining the swamp, fake noos, rigged elections, broken parliaments & packed supreme courts ... strongman tactics which all failed to deliver as Joe Sixpack rumbled the soothsayers and resolutely refused to be conned ... it seemed Joe wanted his own life back and to go for longevity in his own way.

Perhaps there were 'fantastical opportunities' freedom rather than the perpetual 'doom & gloom' of tyranny & oppression and bribery & corruption?\nSocial institutions underpinned creative, cooperative synergies of specialisation & scale as the evolution of 'know how' was nurtured and grown -\nmoral sentiments - as the golden rule of 'do unto others'\nempirical science - as observation, mathematic theory, testable hypotheses, experimental validation, peer review ...\ntorts, trade & technology - as commercial companies and bankruptcy\n... which all required constant -\nhard work, honesty & thrift - the 2nd law of thermodynamics saw to that ...\ndue diligence - checks & balances, separation of powers, term limits on all Bishops, Princes, Generals & Bureaucrats\ncaveat emptor - defence systems against all parasites & predators also inevitably evolve - as soon as there are stocks there are thieves\n... without growing such institutions\ntyranny & oppression, bribery & corruption ... and\ncrowd trouble\n... become inevitable\nThe Blind Watch Maker was immune from treachery otherwise he wouldn't have survived ... natural selection of 'know how' and the liberal order?\nThe science underpinning liberal democracy as a universal expression of biological cognitive & emotional emergent phenomena has been recently summarised by The Brights. The moral sentiments of cooperation are underpinned by biology they are universal throughout the globe & not confined to self conscious, rational, folk but also apparent in infants and animals.\nLiberal democracy is an outcome of a Darwinian process where cooperation emerges from interactions in populations as synergies are discovered and accumulated, discrediting the idea of democracy as a construction of a deliberate rational purposeful intentional planned social design -\nwhere individual preferences are aggregated into 'something' called 'society' and a 'common good' is calculated (unfortunately the maths is impossible and conclusions contradictory)\nor where deliberating, discussing and persuading others to agree leads to a consensus 'common good' (unfortunately rational debate often leads to polarisation, entrenched differences and 'analysis paralysis' or 'collective fiddles while Rome burns' with tittle tattle prevailing at the expense of evolutionary science)\nEvolutionary thinking reveals new insights into the democratic conundrums -\nPlato's - 'mob rule and emasculation of the wise'\nPlato's - 'who guards the Guardians?'\nJohn Locke's democratic caveat - 'freedom under the law'\nThomas Hobbes' 'Leviathan' - 'the people\ncan't be trusted to do what is right'\nsome of the people behave\nall the time, all the people behave some of the time but all the people\nnever behave all the time\nAll authoritarian elites have a impulse to command & control at the expense of the civil liberties essential for creative innovations - the ancient Greeks identified a double whammy -\nPlato suggested elites could never agree as they had imperfect knowledge of reality, just opinions in the mind, mere shadows of reality.

It’s weird. But that’s for another article.\nSo, in answer to the question: why were the Jews so persecuted throughout history? Nietzsche offers some incredible insights which I have whittle down to two main points.\nFirst, the Jews were historically wanderers without a home country, yet regardless of where they found themselves they always prospered. And not just prospered but prospered to a degree that roused envy in the people among whom they settled. There are a number of reasons for this, but some of the more obvious ones are that the Jews have deep roots stretching back for thousands of years – they know who they are and where they come from thanks to tradition and written documents as old as civilization itself. Along with their deep history comes the passing on of skills, knowledge, and wealth from generation to generation. For example, some Jewish families have historically excelled in the art of making clothes and passed down this skill through family lines. Poverty is not in your future if you are a skilled tailor or seamstress; it doesn’t matter what country you live in, all people everywhere and at all times need clothes. If you can make top notch clothes you will never starve. Few other people groups on the planet have perfected trades passed down for generations.\nSecond, the Jews have a “resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before ‘modern ideas.’” This is not to say that all Jews everywhere are adherents to Judaism, however the fact that they have a cultural faith from which they can tether their identity saves them from the need to be always keeping up with the latest and greatest social identity fads (something that shackled the Germans of the 1930’s and 40’s). Those who do not have this identity-tether are constantly thrown with every wave of new thought, every false promise of progress, and hence always winding up back at the starting blocks. Actual progress in anything requires a stable starting point – the Jews have always had this. Not needing to assimilate to the immediate intellectual culture of the host country, the Jews have successfully evaded many ideological pitfalls, which, again, has made them the envy of many.\nThank you for reading, and please comment below with any additional insights or corrections to my thoughts.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Why the Jews?: Nietzsche on the Jewish persecution | Eric ...\") Why have the Jews suffered so much persecution throughout history? This is a typical question that comes up after one realizes just how constant the persecution of Jew has been, and history offers no shortage of scholars to answer it. Admittedly I am no such scholar. At best I am a cursory observer of the subject, but I am impressed with what I recently read from Nietzsche.\nNietzsche lived and wrote in the late 19th century, a single generation before Nazism hit Germany. For those unfamiliar with his writings let us just say that he possessed a rare genius of psychological insight and was perhaps the most gifted thinker of his generation in terms of his ability to diagnose the ‘spirit of the age,’ (so to speak) and to detect his place in the cycle of history.\nMost people instinctively jump to Nazism and Hitler’s death camps as the most extreme example of Jewish suffering. In my experience, many of these people tend to lack a sense of the social context of pre-1940’s Germany, and often imagine the Jewish persecution under Nazism as an arbitrary act of blind racism. And though it was blind (as all racism is blind), it was not at all arbitrary. The Germans had a special distain for Jews, but a distain which seems to be a common thread throughout the history of Jewish persecution.\nHere is a telling quote from Nietzsche’s experience:\n“About the Jews, for example: listen – I have never met a German who was favorably inclined towards the Jews… That Germany has an ample sufficiency of Jews, that the German stomach, German blood has difficulty in absorbing even this quantum of ‘Jew’ – as the Italians, the French, the English have absorbed them through possessing a stronger digestion –: this is the clear declaration and language of a universal instinct to which one must pay heed, in accordance with which one must act. ‘Let in no more Jews!’… – thus commands the instinct of a people whose type is still weak and undetermined, so that it could easily be effaced, easily extinguished by a stronger race.”\nHere Nietzsche, in his typical style, calls it like it is: German’s were a weak and undertermined people intimidated by Jews—a stronger race of people. I about dropped my coffee when I came across that last line. Oddly, the Nazis adopted Nietzsche (some might say ‘hijacked’ him) as one of their main pet philosophers for the ‘New Germanism.’ Were they aware of what he said here?\nBut it gets much more honest. Nietzsche continues:\n“The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest, toughest and purest race at present living in Europe; they know how to prevail even under the worst condition, by means of virtues which one would like to stamp as vices – thanks above all to a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before ‘modern ideas.’”\nHoly moly, Nietzsche! Had he said this to Hitler’s face he would’ve been imprisoned for life or shot on the spot.\nBut oh, it gets much, much more honest. Nietzsche continues:\n“That the Jews could, if they wanted – or if they were compelled, as the anti-Semites seem to want – even now predominate, indeed quite literally rule over Europe, is certain; that they are not planning and working towards that is equally certain… it would perhaps be a good idea to eject the anti-Semitic ranters from the country. Go out to meet it with all caution, with selectivity… It is plain that the stronger and already more firmly formed types of the new Germanism could enter into relations with them with the least hesitation.”\nSeriously, this would have got Nietzsche killed by the 3rd Reich had he lived just a generation later. It is truly curious that the Germans held Nietzsche in such high regard for his brilliance—particularly his writings on the ubermensch (the ideal superior man of the future), an idea which mesmerized the Nazis—but seemed to pass over this striking section of his most popular book (“Beyond Good and Evil”). It’s weird. But that’s for another article.\nSo, in answer to the question: why were the Jews so\nDoc 4(Title: \"Persecution of Jews - Wikipedia\") Persecution of Jews\nThe persecution of Jews is a major component of Jewish history, and has prompted shifting waves of refugees and the formation of diaspora communities around the world. The earliest major event was in 597 BCE, when the Neo-Babylonian Empire conquered the Kingdom of Judah and then persecuted and exiled its Jewish subjects. Antisemitism has been widespread across many regions of the world and practiced by many different empires, governments, and adherents of other religions.\nJews have been commonly used as scapegoats for tragedies and disasters such as in the Black Death persecutions, the 1066 Granada massacre, the Massacre of 1391 in Spain, the many pogroms in the Russian Empire, and the ideology of Nazism, which led to the Holocaust, the systematic murder of six million Jews during World War II.\nAncient history\n[edit]Neo-Babylonian Empire\n[edit]The Babylonian captivity or the Babylonian exile is the period in Jewish history during which a large number of Judeans from the ancient Kingdom of Judah were captives in Babylon, the capital city of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, following their defeat in the Jewish–Babylonian war and the destruction of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. The event is described in the Hebrew Bible, and its historicity is supported by archaeological and non-biblical evidence.\nAfter the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem, which resulted in tribute being paid by the Judean king Jehoiakim.[1] In the fourth year of Nebuchadnezzar II's reign, Jehoiakim refused to pay further tribute. This led to another siege of the city in Nebuchadnezzar II's seventh year that culminated in the death of Jehoiakim and the exile to Babylonia of his successor Jeconiah, his court and many others.[2]\nJeconiah's successor Zedekiah and others were exiled in Nebuchadnezzar II's 18th year. A later deportation occurred in Nebuchadnezzar II's 23rd year. The dates, numbers of deportations, and numbers of deportees given in the biblical accounts vary.[2] These deportations are dated to 597 BC for the first, with others dated at 587/586 BC, and 582/581 BC respectively.[3]\nSeleucid Empire\n[edit]When Judea fell under the authority of the Seleucid Empire, the process of Hellenization was enforced by law.[4] This effectively meant requiring pagan religious practice.[5][6] In 167 BC Jewish sacrifice was forbidden, sabbaths and feasts were banned and circumcision was outlawed. Altars to Greek gods were set up and animals prohibited to Jews were sacrificed on them. The Olympian Zeus was placed on the altar of the Temple. Possession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offense.\nRoman Empire\n[edit]The Jewish Encyclopaedia refers to the antisemitic persecution of Jews and the paganization of Jerusalem during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117–138 AD):\nThe Jews now passed through a period of bitter persecution: Sabbaths, festivals, the study of the Torah and circumcision were interdicted, and it seemed as if Hadrian desired to annihilate the Jewish people. His anger fell upon all the Jews of his empire, for he imposed upon them an oppressive poll-tax. The persecution, however, did not last long, for Antoninus Pius (138–161) revoked the cruel edicts.[7]\nMedieval period\n[edit]Europe\n[edit]In the Middle Ages, antisemitism in Europe was religious. Many Christians, including members of the clergy, held the Jewish people collectively responsible for the killing of Jesus. As stated in the Boston College Guide to Passion Plays, \"Over the course of time, Christians began to accept … that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ's death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or 'god-killing'. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.\"[8]\nDuring the Hi\nDoc 5(Title: \"Why Are Jews Persecuted?\") Our Advertisers Represent Some Of The Most Unique Products & Services On Earth!\nWhy Are Jews Persecuted?\nCommentary\nBy Jayne Gardener\n2-19-8\nI always used to wonder what it was about Jews that made people throughout history despise them. If they were indeed \"God's chosen\" I thought, they had to be the unluckiest people in the history of the world.\nWhy were they persecuted throughout history?\nWhy had the Nazis herded them into cattle cars and taken them to \"extermination camps\" to dispose once and for all of the \"Jewish problem?\"\nI suddenly recognized that if Hitler had developed a \"Final Solution\" to the Jewish question, that there had to have been a \"Jewish Problem.\" Could the Jews have in any way behaved in such a manner that would make the countries in which they resided turn against them, or were they just unfortunate, innocent victims?\nI set out to find answers for my questions, mainly turning to the Internet, but also reading various books on the subject. What I found became increasingly disturbing to me.\nI had not known that throughout history, the Jews had been expelled from 79 countries, some countries more than once.\nI had not known that many of the claims they made about the Holocaust that I had believed unquestioningly for so long were in fact fraudulent.\nThe books I had read and the movies I had seen about the \"Holocaust\" and wept over were nothing but thinly veiled attempts to garner unwavering sympathy for the state of Israel and an excuse to extort billions of dollars from Germany and 1.25 billion dollars from the Swiss banks.\nI discovered that a book I had read many times as a teenager and cried about, Anne Frank's Diary, had been at least partially written by someone other than Anne Frank.\nI learned that the confessions at the Nuremburg Trials and the executions of so many German \"war criminals\" were were extracted under torture and the defendants were being tried, judged and condemned by their very accusers.\nI learned about the \"false flag\" operations, especially the Lavon affair and the tragedy of the USS Liberty, an American ship that was attacked by the Israelis during the 1967 war. 34 young American men were killed and many more wounded.\nTo add insult to injury, the Israelis claimed that it was simply an unfortunate case of mistaken identity, something the survivors of the Liberty have always vehemently denied. They, however, were threatened with court martial if they were ever to tell their stories.\nI learned about the Jonathan Pollard spy case and other incidents of Israeli Jews spying against their supposed \"closest ally.\"\nI became shocked and horrified as I learned about the treatment of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories at the hands of the Israeli Defense Forces and the Jewish settlers. Israel purports to be the only democracy in the middle east, but it's only a democracy for Jews. Non-Jews are not considered equal.\nI was saddened to see pictures of innocent Palestinian children burned beyond recognition or suffering from serious gunshot wounds after being targeted by the IDF for no other reason than that they are Palestinian.\nI found out about the Jewish history of avariciousness, larceny, lying, manipulation and their questionable and usurious business practices.\nI learned about their roles in the radical homosexual movement, the radical feminist movement, the pornography industry as well as their over-representation in the abortion industry.\nI discovered their role in organized crime, in the slave trade, in the civil rights movement and in Communism, an ideology that is responsible for the deaths of untold millions and the repression of many millions more.\nI learned that it was Jewish supremacists behind the war against Christianity and Christmas. It is they who want God out of the Pledge of Allegiance and all symbols of Christianity removed from public life.\nThey have driven Christianity from the public schools despite Christianity being the majority religion.\nThey have taken Ch\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, the persecution of Jews has historical roots and can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. Economic success and envy: Jewish communities historically excelled in trades and professions, leading to envy among non-Jewish populations.\n2. Cultural and religious differences: The strong Jewish identity rooted in religion and tradition often contrasted sharply with the changing secular trends of surrounding societies.\n3. Political and military influence: At times, Jewish communities wielded significant political power, sometimes leading to resentment.\n4. Scapegoating: Throughout history, Jews have been blamed for various disasters and misfortunes, acting as convenient scapegoats.\n\nBased on these points, the persecution of Jews stemmed from complex historical, economic, social, and political factors intertwined with periods of scapegoating.\n\n<answer> Economic success and envy </answer>\n\nWhile multiple factors contributed, emphasizing economic success and envy provides a concise initial response based on common historical themes. Further investigation reveals additional layers of complexity involving cultural, political, and religious aspects.\n\nThe specific mention of envy due to prosperity aligns closely with common historical narratives. Thus, revisiting the concise yet impactful summary:\n\n<answer> Economic success and envy </answer>\n\nThis encapsulates a primary driver of Jewish persecution historically, warranting further elaboration but sufficiently addressing the core aspect sought."

From the way we communicate with others to how we shop, dine and travel, social media has impacted how efficient and informed we are. Its impact on the health care industry is evident as well. Mobile phones and applications have become an integral part of our lives. The internet allows people to research symptoms, nearby doctors, and medications and their effects. More and more people are sharing information about health care, including reviews about doctors, their experiences with illness and opinions on different therapies. People can also use social media to ask for advice and search for information on the go, which is an important benefit to many people in the workforce who may not have time to consult a physician face to face.1 Medical programs should prepare students to use these apps that will help them connect even further with their patients.\nHospitals are using social media to reach patients\nHospitals are catching on to this trend and implementing programs to promote the use of social media. They can use it to manage their reputation through referrals and reviews and to brand themselves as providers of reliable information to consumers. According to an article by Med City, more than 1,500 hospitals in the U.S. use social media in some format. 2 Sites like YouTube, Facebook and Foursquare (where users check in at different locations) are some examples. Facebook seems to be the favorite, and hospitals use this social media outlet to reach prospective patients or post reviews about patients’ experiences there. Some hospitals are getting creative with how they reach their community. The Mayo Clinic has more than 76,000 listeners to its podcast. Different subjects are discussed in a format for people to download and listen to on their own time, which is appealing to many people who might be curious about different diseases, new advancements in health care, or human interest pieces about people experiencing different health issues. The Mayo Clinic is one example of an institution that offers advice and expertise from health care professionals for free. All of the doctors there are encouraged to take part in using social media. 2 Another example of how social media is being used by hospitals is in the way Rush University used text messages to dispatch doctors to assist in the recovery effort after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Massachusetts General Hospital’s doctors collaborated with emergency department researchers to create an iPhone app (called EMNet Finder) that helps people find the closest ER facility to them. A health care provider in Texas used Twitter after the deadly shooting at Fort Hood in 2009 to offer updates on Red Cross news, hospital statuses and ER access, which increased their Twitter following by 78 percent. In Omaha, Neb., a cancer patient used YouTube to post videos about her experience at the Nebraska Medical Center, and in doing so reached so many people that the Center opened up a monthly clinic devoted to treating patients with her type of cancer.2\nPatients of all ages are encouraged to use social media\nAccording to a report submitted by GreatCall, 52 percent of smartphone users research health information on their mobile phones. The report also indicated that by 2017 mobile health, or mHealth, is expected to be a $26 billion industry. Currently, more than 97,000 fitness- and health-related mobile applications are offered to users for free or at a small cost. More than 4 million downloads were recorded per day, data which proves the rise of the social media industry’s impact on health care. 3 Medical assistants, who are often the first point of contact for patients as they complete their intake documentation, are learning more about mobile apps and how to encourage all their patients to use them, regardless of their age.

The SparkReport study indicated that more than 80 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 24 were likely to share information about their health and experiences with different providers via social media channels. Almost 90 percent of those people said they would trust information they received through social media.1 A study by SparkReport found that more than 50 percent of the senior population they interviewed were ready to use social media to obtain information and communicate with their doctors because of its convenience and speed. This medium allows them to consult a provider without having to leave their home, and when mobility is an issue, this type of convenience is a major benefit for seniors. Forty-five percent of individuals between the ages of 45 and 64 reported they would share information via social media, and 54 percent of that population said they would be more likely to engage with doctors and other patients with this type of media access.1 1 “Rising Use of Social and Mobile in Healthcare,” The Spark Report.com, Dec. 17 2012, http://thesparkreport.com/branding/infographic-social-mobile-healthcare 2 Baum, Stephanie,”Wow of the week: A detailed breakdown of how hospitals are using social media,” MedCity News.com, July 20, 2013, http://medcitynews.com/2013/11/24-outstanding-statistics-figures-social-media-impacted-health-care-industry/ 3 Dilworth, Diana, “Is Mobile Healthcare the Future?” MediaBistro.com, Aug. 20, 2013, http://www.mediabistro.com/appnewser/is-mobile-healthcare-the-future-infographic_b39773\nDoc 3(Title: \"The Science of Influence: How Social Media Affects ...\") Download Report: Science of Influence – Report\nDownload Infographic: Science of Influence – Infographic\nA special thank you to our sponsors:\nExecutive Summary\nIn a survey of 1,783 internet users, this study explored the level of influence social media has in four industries: healthcare, financial, travel (personal not business), and retail. The results were segmented by four generations: Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers, and the Silent Generation. Consistent with previous studies, the influence of social media continues to play a role in the actions and recommendations of consumers, and that influence continues to rise. This report dives into the results of the survey and gives recommendations for companies.\nKey Findings\nSocial Media is Influential in Decision Making\nWhile differences in the level of influence were found across industries, social media was deemed influential in making decisions and seeking advice. Social media was identified as being influential by 40% of respondents across generational categories in their decision-making related to travel. For other industries, social media was still influential, but to a lesser degree, with 25% of respondents indicating it was influential in financial services, 22% in retail, and 21% in healthcare.\nPeople Seek Advice on Social Media\nMore than one-third of respondents (38%) said they were likely to seek travel advice on social media. Nearly one-quarter of respondents (21%) said they were likely to seek advice in decision-making related to financial services, healthcare (25%) and retail purchases (18%).\nAge Makes a Difference\nAcross all categories, age played a role in how influential social media was for survey respondents—the younger the respondents, the more likely they were to say that social media, including the sources and channels, were influential.\nThird-Person Effect Plays a Role\nThe third-person effect occurs when individuals believe others are more influenced by social media than they themselves are. This effect was just studied in the retail industry, but 33 percent of “others” were believed to be influenced by social media compared to the 22 percent of survey respondents who indicated that social media was influential in their own retail decisions.\nClose Friends and Family are the Most Influential Source\nAcross all generations, social media posts from close friends and family were the most influential source, but the degree of influence depended on the industry. Close friends and family were a critical source in the travel industry for all generations: Millennials (62%), Generation X (61%), Baby Boomers (48%), and the Silent Generation (48%). Close/friends and family were also an influential source for Millennials (51%) in the financial services industry and the retail industry (49%). Close friends and family were also an important source for the Silent Generation (42%) in the healthcare industry.\nWord-of-Mouth Reigns as the Most Influential Channel\nConsistently across most industries and across generations, word-of-mouth was the most influential channel. Promotions, forums, websites of companies, and online reviews were also deemed to be influential. In the retail industry, promotions and online reviews were more important than word-of-mouth. Advertisements and commercials, both traditional and social, were typically the least influential channels.\nInfographic:\nDoc 4(Title: \"How CHD Affects One's Social Life - ACHA\") ese bonds and begin to realize just how important these friendships will be throughout their entire lives.

Think of the last time you used a mobile or PC device; chances are you were probably on one or more of the popular social media apps, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or YouTube.\nThe numbers are also there to support this theory, according to the Pew research center, social media use among Americans have risen from 5% in 2005 to 69% in 2016. The Digital in 2017 Global Overview research done by We Are Social, and Hootsuite also reveal that approximately 2.80 billion people now use social media frequently, this equals 37% of the worldwide population.\nThe numbers are staggering and aren’t likely to slow down anytime soon. Social media is taking over, and the only way for a business to remain relevant is to adapt to the climate. A strategic social media app developed for your business can give you an edge over the competition. For aspiring app developers, social media app development is only in its beginning stages and has a lot of room for improvements. If you are wondering how to create a social media app, you should first answer the following questions.\nTo begin, it is important to know the basics of what makes a successful social media app. What features are users looking for? What do the Big social media platforms have in common? While this answer is not entirely straightforward and can only be answered by individual experimenting, it still holds that the successful social media apps of today have some basic features that app developers need to adopt in building their social media apps.\n1. Ease of Connectivity.\nThe entire point of social media is a way to bring internet users together. Before the invention of the concept, the internet was just one vast “planet” of sorts that everyone navigated alone. Of course, our innate human need for connection found this to be extremely uncomfortable and ever since have discovered new ways to create convenient and quick connectivity between users. Social media allows you to keep in touch with friends, family, and idols all over the world.\nTo build a successful social media app you will need to maintain or build upon this ease of connectivity. Your app would need seamless navigation features. There should be little or no stress in signing up, login in or socialize as it is. All the major social media apps require little effort from users to connect, and your app would have to follow suit to attract a fanbase.\n2. Ability to Extensively Customize Individual Profiles.\nOne significant advancement experts have come to observe in social media is the gradual ability for users to create customized profiles in other to stand out.\nOnce upon a time, chat rooms allowed users only to use avatars in their image displays. Today, apps allow and expect you to use an image of yourself on their platforms. In addition, users now have the ability to upload image or videos of their personal lives, where they have been, what they ate, or who they are with. Of course, the latest in this trend is live videos; Facebook live, Instagram live, Snapchat and Twitter Periscope allow users to give live updates of what they are doing. It seems the more ability users have to customize their social media pages the happier they are.\nTo this effect, it may be work in your best interest to add filters, special fonts, or other groundbreaking effects to your app that will help users create unique and exciting profiles.\n3. Ability to Expand User Following.\nThis is one of the primary reasons Instagram has experienced so much success with its app. Instagram gives you the easiest access to millions of people all over the world. As a result, it is easy to build a following on the platform, and anyone can gather thousands of fans in a relatively short period compared to other social media apps.\nMobile app developers should take a cue or two from\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the provided information, social media significantly impacts healthcare by providing patients and healthcare professionals with a platform to share and seek information.

In the world of cut throat competitive and volatile scenario, we need to understand the cause of Change, rather than rigid / close minded approach to sail successfully. Let‘s look into the “Why?” part of Change for our benefits:\n- Competition – to be successful, remain competitive is the key mantra by adopting the latest and innovative practices (Incl. technology-commerce – social aspects), suited to individual organizations.\n- Technology – Innovation & Technology will be the two key lifelines survival. Success positions with quick acclimatization of latest technology and its implementation. Procrastination in this matter may prove futile, which we have been seeing very often.\n- Compulsive demand from the Client / customer also pushes a supplier organization to change with respect to their processes, product / service lines. etc. to bring the deliverable to expected level. Three important aspects I wish to mention here is “Quality at Competitive Cost on Time”\n- Government Regulations- any changes in government regulations will have an impact on how an Organization does business / operate within guidelines.\nAbove all, Desire to Grow is another important factor triggers organization to constantly align with the latest innovations / change. The Organization / business that continue to survive and even thrive are usually the ones that most readily adapt to change.\nDoc 2(Title: \"What Causes Change in an Organization? 10 Factors Explored\") Change is constant, and change is inevitable.

Knowing the factors which cause change helps a manager to take decisions accordingly, which helps the organization grow and reduces the chances of loss.\nIn this article, you will learn about the different factors which cause changes in an organization.\nTable of Contents\nFactors that cause a change in an organization\n1) Change in governmental policies\nNo matter whether your organization is a public organization or a private organization government has control on it; however, the percentage of control varies.\nHave you ever wondered how specific businesses have thrived amidst constant organizational change?\nQuick Statistics: According to a study by McKinsey & Company, over 70% of change management efforts within organizations fail. However, companies that engage in active communication and employee involvement during change processes have 30% higher success rates in implementing changes efficiently. This highlights the critical importance of open communication in successful organizational transformations. (Source: McKinsey & Company, 2023)\nBrief Case Studies: A notable example is Netflix, which successfully transformed its business model from DVD rentals to a leading streaming service. By continuously innovating and diving into content creation, Netflix increased its subscriber base from 23 million in 2011 to over 200 million in 2023. This shift not only improved customer engagement but also allowed Netflix to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing digital environment. (Source: Netflix Earnings Reports)\nGovernment policies decide the way an organization operates and what it can produce and not. For example, recently in India government has banned the use of certain types of plastic and because of this policy.\nThe operations of many organizations have changed as they are needed to make changes in the plastic. Similarly, there are various policies like employment hire policy, wages policy, and rights of employees and workers are controlled by the organization and the organizations are required to abide by these policies to be able to operate freely.\nFor example, in India, there is a policy that a minimum of 30% of the total employees of an organization should be women. This forces organizations to hire woman employees.\n2) Change in market demand\nAnother important factor which causes a change in an organization is the changing demand of the market. Gone are the days when people are required to accustom themselves because of the products provided by the companies because, at that time, they did not have many options to choose from.\nIn modern times, there are several options available for one product in the market, and people have the freedom to choose from any of the product, and they have become less loyal for brands. They buy products from an organization which provides them a good quality of products at the lowest prices.\nBecause of this reason, companies are required to stay on their toes and change fast in order to facilitate the changing requirements of their customers.\nFor examples, in the era of the internet, people prefer to shop online rather than shopping from a physical store. Therefore, organizations are required to take their businesses online so that they can fulfill the changing demand of their customers.\nHere is another example of a change in the market demand is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are\nDoc 3(Title: \"Factors that Cause Change in Organizations: Planned and ...\") Factors that Cause Change in Organizations: Planned and Unplanned\nTable of Contents\n- Types of Change\n- External Forces of Change\n- Internal Forces of Change\n- Lesson Summary\n- Learning Outcomes\nEvery day for the past 30 years, Robert went to work at Cheapo Toys in the marketing department. He loved his job and was proud of all of his accomplishments. One day, on his way into work, he was greeted by a human resource manager. The manager took Robert aside and informed him that the company was having a corporate-wide layoff. Robert was laid off immediately and given a severance package. He was in total disbelief! Cheapo Toys' layoff was a huge change for the organization, and it occurred due to a number of factors.\nPlanned and unplanned are the two types of changes that can occur with an organization. Planned change occurs when deliberate decisions are made in an organization, while unplanned change is a result of unforeseen occurrences. Ironically, the layoff was a planned change for Cheapo Toys, but an unplanned change for Robert. External factors and internal factors can cause both of these types of changes within a company. Let's take a look at specific examples of each with Cheapo Toys as our backdrop.\nAn external force of change occurs from an outside influence on the organization. There are four main external forces of change:\n- Globalization\n- Workforce Diversity\n- Ethical Behavior\n- Technology\nCheapo Toys' original employees consisted of American employees who operated at two East Coast locations. Due to the globalization of the economy, the company was forced into many changes over the last 20 years. Cheapo Toys' competitors did not just consist of American companies but foreign as well. The kid population was declining in the U.S., so Cheapo Toys had to look elsewhere for sales. A big change for Cheapo Toys was building factories and selling overseas. The company now operates in over 10 different countries, ranging from France, London, Japan and India.\nA diverse workforce has also created a huge change for the company. When Cheapo Toys began years ago, most of their workforce consisted of men. Now, females are represented equally and all ethnicities exist within their various international locations.\nThe third external force of change is society's expectation of ethical behavior. Companies are now held to a higher standard of ethics. For example, companies have a social responsibility to ensure that their products do not damage the environment during the production process. Companies also have to conduct themselves ethically when it comes to their finances. Cheapo Toys has had to make huge changes in how they design, manufacture and sell their toys. All of their toys now have to be made with plastics made of safe chemicals for kids. In addition, the company has had to hire additional quality engineers to make sure that the products are designed for all of the changed safety standards.\nThe last external force that creates change in organizations is technology. Companies constantly have to change every aspect of their work life to ensure that they remain competitive. For example, Cheapo Toys just completed a three-day sales training session. All of their sales reps' laptops were traded for tablets. The tablets allow for easy presentations, traceability and sales order processing. Companies need to stay ahead of the technological curve or they will be left behind. Only 15 years ago, Cheapo Toys relied on just voicemail and emails for their sales reps' daily workload.\nThere are also numerous internal forces of change that companies must monitor.\nAn internal force of change occurs from internal sources, such as employees or company performance. These types include:\n- Poor Financial Performance\n- Internal Crisis (such as a strike)\n- Changes in Employee Expectations\nMost companies, at one time or another, are faced with poor financial performance. This, in turn, causes significant changes that need to be made in order to hel\nDoc 4(Title: \"Organisational Change: Meaning Causes and Its Process\") After reading this article you will learn about:- 1. Meaning of Organisational Change 2. Causes of Organisational Change 3. Response 4. Process 5. Resistance.\nMeaning of Organisational Change:\nOrganisational change refers to any alteration that occurs in total work environment. Organisational change is an important characteristic of most organisations. An organisation must develop adaptability to change otherwise it will either be left behind or be swept away by the forces of change. Organisational change is inevitable in a progressive culture. Modern organizations are highly dynamic, versatile and adaptive to the multiplicity of changes.\nOrganisational change refers to the alteration of structural relationships and roles of people in the organization. It is largely structural in nature. An enterprise can be changed in several ways. Its technology can be changed, its structure, its people and other elements can be changed. Organisational change calls for a change in the individual behaviour of the employees.\nOrganizations survive, grow or decay depending upon the changing behaviour of the employees. Most changes disturb the equilibrium of situation and environment in which the individuals or groups exist. If a change is detrimental to the interests of individuals or groups, they will resist the change.\nCauses of Organisational Change:\n(A) External Pressures:\ni. Change in Technology and Equipment:\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nAdvancements in technology is the major cause (i.e., external pressure) of change. Each technological alternative results in new forms of organization to meet and match the needs.\nii. Market Situation:\nChanges in market situation include rapidly changing goals, needs and desires of consumers, suppliers, unions etc. If an organization has to survive, it has to cope with changes in market situations.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\niii. Social and Political Changes:\nOrganisational units literally have no control over social and political changes in the country. Relations between government and business or drive for social equality are some factors which may compel for organisational change.\n(B) Internal Pressures (Pressures for Change from Within the Organisation):\ni. Changes in the Managerial Personnel:\nOne of the most frequent reasons for major changes in the organisation is the change of executives at the top. No two managers have the same style, skills or managerial philosophies.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nii. Deficiencies in the Existing Organization:\nMany deficiencies are noticed in the organisations with the passage of time. A change is necessary to remove such deficiencies as lack of uniformity in the policies, obstacles in communication, any ambiguity etc.\niii. Other Factors:\nCertain other factors such as listed below also demand a change in the organisation.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nEmployee’s desire to share in decision-making\nEmployee’s desire for higher wage rate\nImprovement in working conditions, etc.\nResponse to Organisational Change:\nEvery change is responded by the people working in the organisation. These responses may be positive or negative depending upon the fact as how they affect people.\nBefore introducing a change, the manager should study and understand employee’s attitudes so as to create a positive response. Three sets of factors-psychological, personal and social- govern the attitude of people.\nProcess of Organisational Change:\nUnless the behavioural patterns of the employees change, the change will have a little impact on the effectiveness of the organisation.\nA commonly accepted model for bringing change in people was suggested by Kurt Lewin in terms of three phase process:-\n(1) Unfreezing:\nThe essence of unfreezing phase is that the individual is made to realize that his beliefs, feelings and behaviour are no longer appropriate or relevant to the current situation in the organisation. Once convinced, people may change their behaviour. Reward for those willing to change and punishment for others may help in this matter.\n(2) Ch\nDoc 5(Title: \"What Causes Change in an Organization? 10 Factors Explored\") nd is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are environment-friendly in order to gain the loyalty and respect of their customers.\n3) Changed technology\nTechnology is one of the most important factors which force change in the organization, and organizations are required to adapt to these changing technologies in order to keep up with the competition.\nFor example, in the past times, all works like record keeping, order placement, etc. were being done manually, but in the present time with the help of computers, there is no need to perform these works manually.\nSimilarly, in the production process, there were many tasks which workers were supposed to perform with hands, but at present, with automation, all of these works are performed using machines, and this has not only reduced the man-error but also sped up the production process.\nNow customers have a platform to reach to the organization, and companies can respond to the queries made by customers quickly because of the presence of advanced technology.\nTherefore, companies are required to stay focused and make changes in technology whenever they require to stay relevant in the market.\n4) Social changes\nSocial change is also a crucial factor which causes a change in an organization. Companies are required to change their production process with the changes in the needs and aspirations of people.\nDemands of people vary on the basis of the social environment and the status of people — factors like level of education, international influence, urbanization cause social changes.\nFor example, the demands of people living in an urban area will be different from the demands of people living in rural areas. People living in an urban area don’t much care about the price of the product, but they care about the quality and services provided by the organization.\nWhereas, on the other hand, people living in rural areas are more concerned about the price of the product and care less about the quality of the product and they usually choose products cheapest among all available alternatives.\n5) Failure\nFailure is a factor which puts an end on the operations of some organization as these organizations take with shame and stops from taking risks with innovation ideas.\nHowever, there are some organizations which rather than sitting back and thinking about bankruptcy has taken failure as a challenge and worked hard to change the failure into success by analyzing their weak operations and the operations which were not working well for them and changed them in order to proceed towards success.\nA common example that everyone is aware of is the success story of Apple company. Steve Jobs, the founder of the company, was driven out of the company because of his aggressive behavior, and the company started losing its business after Steve left the company.\nSteve was hired back by the company in 1997, and now we all know how his alliance with the Apple company has proved beneficial for it.\nAt present Apple is one of the largest companies in the world. Steve was not intimidated by the failure, but he has trust in his skills and vision. He took the company in his hands when it is at its lowest and take it to the peak of success.\nSimilarly, there are several examples of companies which took failure as a lesson and worked hard to become successful companies again. However, sailing through tough times is not a cup of tea of every organization, emerging from failure requires strength, vision, and a tremendous amount of hard work.\n6) Competitive innovation\nCompetitive innovation forces companies to change. When a competitive company innovate something or do something which can be dangerous for your product then to meet the competition you need to make changes in you\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, several factors cause changes in organizations:\n\n1. **Competition** - Competitors' actions force companies to innovate and improve.\n2. **Technological Change** - Advances in technology require organizations to adapt.\n3. **Market Demand** - Shifts in consumer preferences and needs prompt adjustments.\n4. **Government Regulations** - Changes in laws and policies affect operational norms.\n5. **Desire to Grow** - Organizations evolve to incorporate new innovations.\n6. **External Pressures** - Factors like globalization, workforce diversity, ethical behavior expectations, and social changes.\n7. **Internal Pressures** - Such as deficiencies in existing structures, managerial personnel changes.\n\nBased on the evidence, changes in organizations are primarily caused by external pressures including technological advancements, market shifts, regulatory changes, and social dynamics. </think>\n<answer> competition </answer>\n<answer> technological change </answer>\n<answer> market demand </answer>\n<answer> government regulations </answer>\n<answer> desire to grow </answer>\n<answer> external pressures </answer>\n<answer> internal pressures </answer>\n\nAfter reviewing the information, the primary causes of changes in organizations include competition, technological change, market demand, government regulations, desire to grow, external pressures, and internal pressures."

With time it has expanded and grown to levels starting, post liberalization policies in 1991. Today, the Indian Banking Sector comprises of accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise, and withdrawal by cheque, draft, order or otherwise as given under 5 (b) of Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\nThis sector is the fastest growing due to huge Indian population and market involved. As the financial services industry has become more entrepreneurial and innovative, its risk and product diversification has grown posing significant challenges for Indian regulators, who strive to develop clear rules and fair regulations for both customers and banks to reconcile its services with the satisfaction level of customers.\nIn course of business of banking, a banker undertakes to perform such services as buying and selling securities on his behalf, collecting cheques, dividends, bills or promissory notes on his behalf and acting as a trustee, attorney, executor, correspondent or a representative of a customer. The services provided in the Indian Banking Sector are those available to potential users and equivalent to those covered under 2 (1) (o) of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred as “Act, 1986”). Indian Government enacted the abovementioned Act,1986 as the name suggests, to protect the interest of the consumers and to provide them a mechanism for easy, quick and cheap redressal of grievances against the mighty and unscrupulous producers/ traders and service providers.\nThe government relied highly on the guidelines passed in United Nations General Assembly through resolution No. 39/248 on 8/4/1985. These guidelines relate to consumer protection and provide the framework for the Governments of the developing countries, for formulation of consumer protection policies and legislation.\nOn any dispute arising out of the banking services, where the person against whom a complaint has been made, denies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint, can seek protection under the Act, 1986. A comprehensive framework for dispute resolution has been enshrined under the Act, 1986. It has three-tier system to deal with consumer complaints,\nA).

Even with potential deregulatory efforts that may be considered by the new administration, banks should prioritize governance, risk management, and compliance to manage uncertainties, address outstanding issues, and remain competitive. Explore insights that can help banks thrive amid change.\nDespite a shift in administrations, the banking industry will likely remain focused on addressing outstanding supervisory issues and demonstrating sustainable remediation in 2025. Institutions should prioritize governance, risk management, and compliance programs while remaining competitive and innovative to meet customer expectations. Failure to execute strong remediation and regulatory compliance could lead to higher remediation costs and extended time in the regulatory “penalty box.”\nFor our 2025 banking regulatory outlook, we’ve identified four key topics affecting the industry:\nA new presidential administration and changes in party control across both chambers of Congress are expected to affect the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions in 2025. A second Trump administration will introduce new regulatory leaders and is likely to focus on deregulatory efforts, including rolling back of—or even potentially overturning—several of the previous administration’s regulatory initiatives. While a more permissive regulatory environment is expected, changes to financial supervision typically come more slowly. Banks will still need to address their existing supervisory findings and should continue to prioritize improving their risk management and controls.\nPresident Trump could revoke executive orders from President Biden on mergers, climate risks, and artificial intelligence (AI) and revive prior deregulatory orders. The new administration might also look to ease regulations on bank mergers and nonbank entries.\nBanks are entering 2025 with numerous regulatory challenges and opportunities. A new administration provides a chance to reshape banking regulations and create new business avenues. However, the year will be marked by complexity and uncertainty as recent Supreme Court decisions and industry-led legal challenges create an unpredictable regulatory environment. Banks should be cautious of regulatory fragmentation, which could result in inconsistent requirements across federal agencies.\nThe regulatory focus will likely be on issue remediation and financial resilience. Changes to bank capital and liquidity rules may have an impact on cost structures, while non-financial risks such as operational resilience, cybersecurity, third-party risk management, financial crime, and AI are expected to remain priorities. Given this, banks should prioritize regulatory engagement and strong governance frameworks. Staying responsive to supervisory feedback, addressing supervisory findings, and maintaining agility will be crucial to navigating the fast-evolving landscape.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the banking industry, check out our recently released 2025 banking and capital markets industry outlook here.\nDoc 5(Title: \"Discuss the Liability of Bank Under Consumer Protection Act 1986\") complaints where the cause of action, wholly or in part may arise or where the opposite party resides or conducts its business or has branch office.

So, any person who owns an account in the Bank or takes a service from bank becomes its customer and he can file a complaint for deficiency or regarding unfair practices by the banks. Since, the establishment of Consumer Forum many situations have been found where Banks were held liable for deficiency in their services.\nThe stoppage of operation of account without prior intimation, closing of account without the instructions of the account older would amounts to deficiency of services. A bank is liable for the loss of contents kept in the locker and can be held liable for deficiency in its services. Refusal of cheque book facility to a customer, wrongful dishonor of cheques due to negligence or mistake on the part of the Bank, wrongful dishonor of Demand Drafts due to lapse or omission on the part of officials of the Bank amounts to deficiency of services.\nNegligent act of bank or its staff during the course of employment amounts deficiency of banking services, failure of cashier to deposit the amount collected at the counter, rude behavior, non-returning of dishonoured cheque (where the complainant was unable to take action against the drawer without the instrument), transfer of money of a depositor from his account and deposit in the account of another customer in the absence of directions from the customer amounts to be deficiency in banking services.

In daily course of banking business, the interest granted by banks should not exceed the prescribed limit of RBI, they have a duty to inform about this to depositor failure of which would amount to deficiency in service.\nIf the banks fail to return the security documents even after repayment of the whole loan, they shall be liable of deficiency of services. Failure of bank to honour bank guarantee on demand would amount deficiency in service. The non-issuance of bank guarantee despite security deposit with the Bank would amount to deficiency in service and the complainant would be entitled to interest on that security amount.

And true, it’s not going to be easy-peasy but it’s the only thing that stands between you and comfort. While others might say that it’s “chiropractic magic” it is known as Chiropractic Techniques.\nBut it’s not as simple as that because these techniques are done by specialists who have gone through training and a lot of studying to perfect the work.\nNevertheless, chiropractic care may be a well-known, non-surgical treatment, but many are still doubtful whether this is safe or not.\nOver 50% of the population of America is suffering from back pain. Most of those that are going through such an excruciating have taken physical therapy and followed doctors’ orders. Did anything happen?\nA good number of these poor individuals take medications to cure their pain, some undergo unnecessary surgeries but there are others who take the other way and visit a chiropractor instead.\nThose who have visited a chiropractor can attest that these manual adjustments helped ease their low-back pains, neck pain, headaches, digestive problems, and even their allergies.\nChiropractic Adjustment- when did it start?\nChiropractic care history can go as far as 1895. A man named Daniel David Palmer was the first to perform chiropractic adjustment on a partially-deaf janitor. This janitor worked at Palmer’s office. Lillard, the janitor, said that he moved the wrong way and he heard a “pop” in his back.\nThis caused him to lose his hearing to which Palmer offered to help on his adjustments - his bone adjustments. Palmer administered the work, working on Lillard. The next day, Lillard could already hear better.\nAll about chiropractic treatment.\nChiropractic care is meant to be a complementary treatment for individuals who are looking to discover other conservative-alternative to drugs and surgery.\nChiropractors of today's generation are often working in conjunction with primary care doctors. They also work with pain experts and surgeons to treat patients who suffer from pain.\nChiropractic treatment involves a holistic approach to wellness. The main focus of this treatment is healing the body using manual manipulation of the musculoskeletal system which is also centered on the area around the spine.\nChiropractors use a combination of massage, pressure, stretches, and different exercises in order to successfully re-align the vertebrae. This, in turn, will alleviate the pain and help give back the balance that the body needs.\nChiropractic Care Treatment - Why Is It Safe?\nUp to this day, chiropractors are still being questioned about the safety of their patients. Some are hesitant to be open up to such a practice. The issue surrounding Chiropractic specialization is an open debate for everyone.\nBut let's list the reasons why many would consider chiropractic care safe and effective.\nTheir Level Of Education.\nA Chiropractor who wants to specialize in this kind of work is like all the other medical professionals, he or she must pass a state licensing exam.\nTo even qualify to take the exam, a person should complete at least 2 years of undergraduate education and 4 years of specialization in chiropractic courses. By the end of the training, the chiropractors earn a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree.\nSome even continued to pursue a postdoctoral education in different areas which may include neurology, sports injury, nutrition, and also occupational injuries and pediatrics.\nChiropractic education is not something that you should take lightly because other than being good at what they do, they also have the brains behind i\nDoc 2(Title: \"Is Chiropractic Care Safe? | Mt.

Depending on your clinical condition, he or she can forego manipulation, and instead can recommend joint mobilization, therapeutic exercise, soft-tissue techniques, or other therapies.\nOngoing Research\nThe American Chiropractic Association believes that patients have the right to know about the health risks associated with any type of treatment, including chiropractic. Today, chiropractic researchers are involved in studying the benefits and risks of spinal adjustment in the treatment of neck and back pain through clinical trials, literature reviews and publishing papers reviewing the risks and complications of neck adjustment.\nAll available evidence demonstrates that chiropractic treatment holds an extremely small risk. The chiropractic profession takes this issue very seriously and engages in training and postgraduate education courses to recognize the risk factors in patients, and to continue rendering treatment in the most effective and responsible manner.\nReferences\n1.

New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1997, p. 230-8.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Is Chiropractic Care Safe? | Mt. Olive Chiropractic Clinic\") Chiropractic is widely recognized as one of the safest, drug-free, non-invasive therapies available for the treatment of back pain, neck pain, joint pain of the arms or legs, headaches, and other neuromusculoskeletal complaints. Although chiropractic has an excellent safety record, no health treatment is completely free of potential adverse effects.\nThe risks associated with chiropractic, however, are extremely small. Many patients feel immediate relief following chiropractic treatment, but some may sometimes experience mild soreness or aching, just as they do after some forms of exercise. Current literature shows that minor discomfort or soreness following spinal manipulation typically fades within 24 hours.\nIn addition to being a safe form of treatment, spinal manipulation is incredibly effective, getting patients back on their feet faster than traditional medical care. A March 2004 study in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics found that chiropractic care is more effective than medical care at treating chronic low-back pain in those patients who have been experiencing the symptoms for one year or less. In addition, a study published in the July 15, 2003, edition of the journal Spine found that manual manipulation provides better short-term relief of chronic spinal pain than a variety of medications.\nNeck Adjustments\nNeck pain and some types of headaches are treated through precise cervical manipulation. Cervical manipulation, often called a neck adjustment, works to improve joint mobility in the neck, restoring range of motion and reducing muscle spasm, which helps relieve pressure and tension.\nNeck manipulation is a remarkably safe procedure. While some reports have associated upper high-velocity neck manipulation with a certain kind of stroke, or vertebral artery dissection, recent evidence suggests that this type of arterial injury often takes place spontaneously, or following everyday activities such as turning the head while driving, swimming, or having a shampoo in a hair salon.\nPatients with this condition may experience neck pain and headache that leads them to seek professional care—often at the office of a doctor of chiropractic or family physician—but that care is not the cause of the injury. The best evidence indicates that the incidence of artery injuries associated with high-velocity upper neck manipulation is extremely rare – about 1 case in 5.85 million manipulations.\nTo put this risk into perspective, if you drive more than a mile to get to your chiropractic appointment, you are at greater risk of serious injury from a car accident than from your chiropractic visit.\nIt is important for patients to understand the risks associated with some of the most common treatments for neck and back pain—prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)—as these options may carry risks significantly greater than those of manipulation. According to a study from the American Journal of Gastroenterology, approximately one-third of all hospitalizations and deaths related to gastrointestinal bleeding can be attributed to the use of aspirin or NSAID painkillers like ibuprofen.\nFurthermore, surgery for conditions for which manipulation may also be used carries risks many times greater than those of chiropractic treatment. Even prolonged bed rest carries some risks, including muscle atrophy, cardiopulmonary deconditioning, bone mineral loss and thromoembolism.\nIf you are visiting your doctor of chiropractic with upper-neck pain or headache, be very specific about your symptoms. This will help your doctor of chiropractic offer the safest and most effective treatment, even if it involves referral to another health care provider. If the issue of stroke concerns you, do not hesitate to discuss it with your doctor of chiropractic. Depending on your clinical condition, he or she can forego manipulation, and instead can recommend joint mobilization, therapeutic exercise, soft-tissue techniques, or other t\nDoc 4(Title: \"Is Chiropractic Care Safe? Why?\") sue a postdoctoral education in different areas which may include neurology, sports injury, nutrition, and also occupational injuries and pediatrics.\nChiropractic education is not something that you should take lightly because other than being good at what they do, they also have the brains behind it.\nIndividualized Treatment.\nIt is normal to be concerned about your safety before you visit a chiropractor. But with their level of education and their combined years of experience, Doctors of Chiropractic definitely know what they are doing.\nThey do manual adjustments depending on what you need. There are no two patients who have the same health problem but they would receive the same chiropractic treatment.\nThis is the reason why chiropractors need to do a thorough assessment first before they can determine the type of treatment that you will go through.\nFor example, two patients are both complaining of a severe headache when they enter the chiropractors’ clinic. However, these two will not undergo the same treatment because the cause of their headaches is not relatively similar.\nThis means that the chiropractors DO NOT treat the symptoms. Rather, they go deep to the cause of the problem and start from there.\nClients’ Best Experience.\nMany athletes seek the help of Chiropractors since they are always testing their body to the limit. Individuals who play sports and who visits the gym are prone to stretching their muscles and joints which causes posture problems.\nAdvocates of chiropractic swear that these treatments help them ease their back pains and tension headaches. This also helps them relax better, improve their posture and balance, and also decrease possible inflammation of the muscles and joints.\nOthers believe that chiropractic helps alleviate their allergies and minimizes their stress levels from the central nervous system.\nYour Responsibilities Before Your First Chiropractic Visit\nJust like visiting a medical doctor, there are certain things that you should do first before your first visit to the chiropractic clinic.\nIf you feel comfortable with spinal manipulation, cracks and all, this is your go-to choice. This goes the same if you have exhausted all of your options to alleviate the discomfort that you’re feeling yet none of them are very helpful, then it's time to visit a chiropractor.\nHere are the things that you need to know to get the most out of your visits and ensure that your treatments are safe.\nLearn About Your Chiropractors Credentials.\nBefore you call to set an appointment, it is important that you check the credentials of your chiropractor first. Remember that he or she should have graduated from an accredited school.\nThese schools are usually given accreditation by the Council on Chiropractic Education or CCE. Recommendations from your medical doctor will also be helpful. Still, do a background check.\nTake Note of Your Progress.\nOne session will not be enough to treat your condition. Usually, you DC will formulate a treatment plan for you.\nTake note of your progress and show up on your scheduled appointment.\nMissing one visit can greatly affect your healing process. Your chiropractor will usually provide you with your status or how well you are after the treatments.\nDo Not Forget To Walk Around After your Treatment.\nWalking can help your joints and muscles get used to the proper alignment. Your chiropractor will show you different exercises and stretches that you can do at home to help improve your condition. Do your homework and do not just rely on your treatments.\nMany people find chiropractic treatments helpful in their lives.

Overview\nAs an employer, you are required by law to prevent physical and mental ill health in your workers that may occur as a result of your business activities. Your risk assessment will help you decide what actions you need to take to do this.\nAn important part of occupational health is concerned with how work and the work environment can impact on workersâ health, both physical and mental. It also includes how workersâ health can affect their ability to do their job. Put simply this means the effect of work on health and that of health on work.\nIn health and safety law, there are things you must do to make sure workersâ health is not adversely affected by their work and that workers are medically fit to carry out their work safely. This includes:\n- implementing health or medical surveillance when necessary\n- ensuring workers are medically fit to undertake the role required (your industry may produce such standards)\n- reviewing your risk assessment when a worker is returning to work following sickness absence or declares a health condition\nThere are other things that you should do where workers have health conditions or disabilities, either work-related or not. This includes complying with equality legislation when supporting workers both in and returning to work.\nThere are things that you could do which are aimed at improving the general health and well-being of workers. However, these actions should not be prioritised over the things you must do, should be based on your workersâ needs and be evidence based.\nThere is more information on buying support from occupational health professionals and assessing the competence of occupational health professionals.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Using occupational health at work - Acas\") Occupational health is a type of medical service.\nAn employer might use occupational health to help them make decisions about:\n- a worker who is struggling with their physical or mental health\n- the right reasonable adjustments for someone who is disabled\n- someone who has been off sick for a long time or is returning to work after sickness absence\n- how to reduce the amount of time people need to take off sick\n- keeping to other health and safety regulations\n- managing risks to mental health, such as too much pressure at work or bullying\nOccupational health could be through the employer's own occupational health service or an outside agency.\nChecking if your work uses occupational health\nIt's a good idea to check if your organisation has an occupational health policy.\nThis should say:\n- when an occupational health referral or assessment can be made\n- how an occupational health assessment is carried out\n- what both the employer and worker need to do\n- what the next steps are after the occupational health assessment – for example, review whether the adjustments have helped\nSmaller organisations might not have an occupational health policy or scheme.

The legislation forced employers to safeguard their workers from things like excessive heat and cold, mechanical dangers, unsanitary conditions, toxic substances, and other known physical hazards. It also created and empowered OSHA to enforce the legislation.\nEmployee Retirement and Security Income Act\nThe 1974 Employee Retirement and Security Income Act protected workers not from on-the-job hazards, but from shady players who frequently plundered or misspent their retirement savings. The legislation set minimum standards for private-industry pension plans and required companies to disclose information about the plans and how they were managed while also putting fiduciary responsibility on whoever is in charge of their assets.\n1978: Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act\nIn 1978, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act extended to most civilian federal employees the right to unionize, organize, and bargain collectively. It did not protect postal employees, who are covered by legislation specifically written for their industry.\nPregnancy Discrimination Act\nPrior to 1978, courts held that although discrimination based on pregnancy affects only women, it still wasn't considered sex-based discrimination. In 1978, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act amended Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to prohibit sex discrimination based on pregnancy.\n1988: Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act\nBefore the 1988 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which was enacted by Congress without President Ronald Reagan's signature, companies, plants, mines, and other places of business could close without warning, leaving their employees one paycheck away from financial calamity. The new legislation, however, forced most companies with more than 100 employees to give 60 days' written notice in the case of imminent mass layoffs or closings.\n1990: Americans With Disabilities Act\nIn 1990, the 1964 Civil Rights Act was amended yet again when the Americans With Disabilities Act expanded the legislation to include workers with disabilities. Aside from preventing discrimination, the act also required employers to make reasonable accommodations for special needs regarding accessibility.\n1993: Family and Medical Leave Act\nVirtually all wealthy Western countries require employers to provide paid maternity or paternity leave—all except the United States. That remains the case today, but in 1993, new moms and dads got some reprieve with the Family and Medical Leave Act, which mandated 12 job-protected work weeks a year for things like the birth, adoption, and some other circumstances. Ever since, time off has been guaranteed, but not compensated.\n2009: Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act\nIn 2009, the 1964 Civil Rights Act was amended again when President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was named for the Supreme Court plaintiff whose case led to the legislation. The act gave employees more time to file equal-pay lawsuits after learning they were being paid less than someone of the opposite gender for equal work.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Changing Attitudes Towards People With Mental Health ...\") hieve positive mental health we have to overcome these structural barriers and to do this we need the use of health promotion. Health promotion has been described as ‘the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. It moves beyond a focus on individual behaviour towards a wide range of social and environmental interventions”. The term refers to the wide variety of approaches that are applied to help improve health within people, the community and the population. Health promotion allows people the ability and resources to control and improve there overall health. “Health Promotion is concerned with making healthier choices easier choices” (Dennis et al 1982)\nDiscrimination of all kinds has a detrimental effect on mental health. People with mental illness say that discrimination and the stigma attached to it can in fact be more difficult to handle than the mental health problem itself. Statistics show that almost 66% of the population are in contact with an individual who has mental health problems. Discrimination can pervade every part of their daily life ranging from their personal life to the ability to maintain a basic standard of living. Penn and Wykes (2003) stated: “there is evidence of less favourable social interactions, discrimination in work opportunities and housing as well as their access to health care.” This may exclude individuals from day-to-day activities such as going shopping, going out with friends or being part of local community groups. Social exclusion can be psychologically damaging, harmful to health and can also increase risks of premature death. Statistics also show that nearly 75% of individuals who have mental health problems have been put off applying for jobs due to fear of rejection and job insecurity. Dorling (2009) said that unemployment is associated with worsening mental and can increase the levels of depressions, especially in young people. Penn et al (2003) argues this generates: “a negative worsening effect on ill health.”\nThe general perception of mental illness has advanced within the last three decades. However, research shows that this has not helped to reduce the levels of discrimination. Every year the Department of Health conducts a survey to find out the attitudes towards mental health. The latest statistics were published on the 8th of May 2008. Some of the key findings showed that 17% of people said that there are particular characteristics of individuals who suffer with mental ill health that distinguish them from people who do not suffer from the illness. 12% stated that they would not choose to have a neighbour who suffers from mental health problem. 7% of people agreed that the mentally ill were a burden to society. So what can we do to help?\nSee me Scotland was launched in 2002 with one aim ‘to eliminate stigma and discrimination’ in order to succeed in this there were set out five core aims; To challenge individual incidents of stigma and discrimination, To involve people in anti-stigma activities across Scotland at national and local levels and across sectors and communities of interest, To ensure that the voices and experiences of people with mental health problems and their carers are heard and promote a culture of learning and evaluation through all its work, so that effectiveness can be demonstrated and lessons shared. The campaign is based on a set of principles these include non-discrimination, equality, respect for diversity, reciprocity, informal care where possible, and participation. “See me” is working locally and with the media to improve people’s perceptions of mental health problems. “See Me” is also attempting to reconfigure the public’s perception, attitude and knowledge of mental health, to make sure that it is improved in the hope that it will end discrimination against the mentally ill.

However, Britain abused her power towards the colonies and riots began to break throughout the colonists. Therefore, these acts fueled a rebellion against Britain and her colonies so severe, that it became the dawn of the American Revolution. In the 1700s, Britain’s current king, King George, decided that he needed more money from the flourishing colonies.…\nhe primary reason was due to the Stamp Tax, which placed a tax on everyday consumer goods. Colonists by this time had been in the colonies in many cases for 2 generations, so many had never set foot in England. The idea that they had colonized the land and were producing much of England's raw resources, yet did not have representation in the House of Lords or House of Commons to protest taxation lead to the revolt. \"Taxation without Representation\" was the main issue. The tipping point came when tea, a popular drink of the time, was taxed. The East Indian Company controlled the tea market. From what I've read, they were given a lot of support from the British government and were able to deliver tea to the docks in the colonies avoiding some of the taxes other…\nApril 19 of 1775 would go on to mark history as the day a nation made up of different ideas, cultures, races, and experiences would unionize to become a perfect union under their own control. The events that precede the shots heard around the world near Lexington and Concord would conjure up a sense of rebellion, tension, and irritability. The colonists, whether divided by loyalists, patriots, or neutralist, turn the tide and revolutionize America. Over the course of the twelve years following the Seven Years War the colonist would grow tired of the sentiments of being solely British subjects and at their beck and call. The most prominent reasons that encouraged the colonist to be in favor of separating from the British regime follow: Thomas Paine’s Common Sense, the entitlement for self-governance, and overall…\nIn the beginning the colonies had a peaceful relationship with Britain. Both places were experiencing economic growth and the colonists appreciated the hands-off approach that Britain took which allowed them to rule themselves the way they pleased. This system of salutary neglect ended as Britain wanted more direct rule over the colonies passing extremely unfair acts which only angered colonists more. This anger and colonial discontent is what eventually led to the American Revolution.…\nThe cause of the American Revolution can be argued but it is clear that it was caused from British missteps that lead to colonial determination to become a separate nation. After 1763, the British began to increase and assert their power over the colonies, who, in contrast, wanted to be less controlled. However, the colonies did not want complete independence prior to this increase in control from the British. Although the colonies did seem to have determination for an independent nation in England’s eyes, the British failed to recognize the colonies real intentions for government, limited expansion and economic success, and increased and controlled taxation in the colonies.…\nThere were many reasons that led to the colonists uniting and rebelling against Great Britain. A major factor for the colonists to unite and rebel was the fact that Great Britain was forcing them to pay for the French and Indian War through oppressive taxes.

But, in next twelve years, the same pride was altered by at bitter and violent conflict with the mother country. The injustices of the mother country finally led the American colonists to declare independence and wage war against it. American colonies were justified for waging war and breaking away from Britain because they were defending themselves against a series of measures Parliament wished to impose on their communities without their consent.…\nAmerican Colonists were Patriots because they were tired of being denied the “rights as Englishmen”. They were also tired of being taxed without representation in the British government. They said being taxed without representation is not right and they didn’t want to be treated differently because it wasn’t fair. All the American Colonists wanted was to be treated fairly and to have freedom, which they were getting deprived of by staying a part of England.…\nThe colonists in the early 18th century felt closer to their homeland of England than they did to their neighboring colonies. It wasn’t until after the French and Indian War that the colonies started to feel unified in a way. Then with the addition of harsh tax acts and policies the colonists started to question being a part of the British Empire. These acts without the colonist’s consent started to stir up ideas about actually becoming an independent nation and revolting against their English rulers.…\nThe thirteen colonies struggled for independence in North America.

All of this lead to the colonies joining together and rebelling against the British.…\nThe American Revolution was caused by the colonists disagreeing with the British. The things that the british and colonists disagreed on were the Proclamation of 1763. One of the many things that the colonists thought needs changed is how the colonies approach war, which is why the political cartoon of a snake was made. The stamp act taxed most goods in the colonies. The Quartering Act angered colonists, and strengthened distrust between the colonists and the british soldiers. John Dickinson’s letters gave courage to the colonists to protest. The Boston Massacre, as Paul Revere painted it, was one of the most influential paintings to rebel against the british. These are just some of why the colonists rebelled and protested against Great Britain.…\nThere are four major reasons that the rebellion of the colonists accumulated into a full scale revolution. The most indistinct of these four reasons is the old societal legacies of the colonies, namely: social, political, religious, and economic values. These deeply rooted values were ingrained and inherited from the generations of colonists, and once the British began upsetting those values, resentment set in and began to undermine the British authority.

After this became apparent, those living in America began to develop a strong antipathy toward the British.…\nThe American Revolution embarked the beginning of the United States of America. A war that lasted eight years, 1775-1783, was able to grant the thirteen colonies the independence they deserved by breaking free of British rule. The war was an effect of the previous French and Indian War, which forced England to tax the American colonist, compelling them to rebel against parliament. From the 1760’s to 1775, many factors lead up to the American Revolution such as the various acts the British Parliament passed to pay the war debt, no representation in parliament, and the American people wanting to gain their independence. “No Taxation without Representation”, a slogan used by the American colonist, was the most important cause of the colonists declaring war for their independence on the British government.…\nDoc 4(Title: \"The 13 Colonies in the Revolutionary War\") The 13 colonies were one of the many nations who fought in the Revolutionary War in the late 18th century.\nThe 13 colonies were established in North America by Great Britain during the 17th century.

The proprietary colonies were: Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania.\nThe original charter colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island eventually had their charters revoked in the 17th century and were taken over by the British government upon which they became royal colonies with royal governments, much to the colonist’s dismay.\nYet, despite the fact that many of the colonies were royal colonies, for a period of time prior to the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies had been allowed to self-govern.\nThis was due to what is now known as the policy of Salutary Neglect, which was based on the premise that if the colonies were left alone, they would flourish and Great Britain would reap the benefits in increased trade, tax revenue and profits.\nIt was during this period of salutary neglect that the colonies learned to self-govern which helped the colonists develop their sense of independence and self-sufficiency.\nThe policy of Salutary Neglect was in place for many decades, from the early to mid 1700s, until the end of the French and Indian War when the British government found itself in desperate need of funds to pay off the war debt and to cover the cost of the large number of troops it had sent to North America to protect the new land it had won.\nThe 13 Colonies During the Revolutionary War:\nThe American Revolution began after Great Britain passed a series of new taxes designed to generate revenue from the colonies in 1763 to help pay off its war debt.\nThe new taxes were met with a lot of resistance from the colonists because they felt the government didn’t have the right to tax them if they didn’t have representation in Parliament and feared that the new laws were just the beginning of even more infringements on their rights.\nThe colonists believed governments existed to serve and protect the rights and interests of its people, not to serve and protects its own interests. So when the British government began passing laws that seemed to serve its own interests rather than that of its people, it was met with much disapproval in the colonies.\nThe colonists boycotted, protested and even rioted over the new laws. The British government responded to the rebellion by sending British troops to the colonies to restore order and enforce the new laws but the increased military presence only escalated the conflict.\nThe conflict came to a head in April of 1775 when British troops searching for the colonist’s hidden ammunition supplies engaged with American militia in the fir\nDoc 5(Title: \"The 13 Colonies in the Revolutionary War\") British troops to the colonies to restore order and enforce the new laws but the increased military presence only escalated the conflict.\nThe conflict came to a head in April of 1775 when British troops searching for the colonist’s hidden ammunition supplies engaged with American militia in the first battles of the Revolutionary War in Lexington and Concord.\nIn response to the battles, the colonists formed the Continental Army in June of 1775 to help them fight the British army.\nThen, on July 5, 1775, the Continental Congress adopted a surprising piece of legislature known as the Olive Branch Petition, which was a last ditch effort to avoid going to war with Great Britain.\nThe petition was the work of the more moderate members of Congress, who actually opposed the war, and its purpose was to appease King George III and prevent the conflict from escalating into a full blown war.\nYet, before the petition even reached England, King George III had already issued the Proclamation of Rebellion, on August 2, 1775, which declared that the colonies were in an “open and avowed rebellion” and ordered officials of the British Empire to suppress the rebellion.\nWhen the petition did reach the king later that month, he refused to read it and immediately rejected it.\nOn October 27, 1775, King George spoke at Parliament and stated that he intended to deal with the colonial rebellion with armed force and asked for assistance from foreign governments.\nThe proclamation and the King’s vow to fight the rebellion with armed forces destroyed any hope of avoiding an all out war and made it clear that the king was not interested in finding a way to resolve the dispute peacefully.\nOn July 4, 1776, the 13 colonies declared their independence from Great Britain. This declaration finally allowed for the United States to be officially recognized by friendly foreign governments, such as France, who refused to consider the possibility of an alliance without it.\nOn September 9, 1776, the Continental Congress officially changed the name of the 13 colonies from the “United Colonies” to the “United States of America.”\nAs the war waged on, the American economy began to suffer due to a decline in the trade industry brought about by the British blockade of the American ports.\nThe colonies had to rely on European loans to help pay for the war effort. France, Spain and the Netherlands lent the United States over 10 million dollars.\nBecause the Continental Congress didn’t have the authority to tax colonists, it printed paper money at a rapid pace to help pay for the war effort. As a result, the colonies experienced severe inflation and depreciation of the Continental dollar.\nOn November 15, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, but the states did not ratify them until March 1, 1781.\nIn February of 1778, France finally joined the war as an ally to the American colonists. Then, in 1779, Spain joined as an ally of the French, in 1780, the Kingdom of Mysore joined as an ally of the French and, in 1782, the Dutch Republic joined as an ally of the American colonists.\nThe war shifted to the southern colonies after 1778 and eventually spread across the world, to India, the West Indies and Europe, as the various countries joined the war effort.\nIn February of 1782, after a long and costly war, Parliament voted to concede American independence.\nThis started two years of peace talks between Great Britain and the United States which resulted in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.\nThe 13 Colonies After the Revolutionary War:\nThe fledgling United States was in a chaotic state after the Revolutionary War. The period after the war was characterized by economic depression and political crisis.\nThe thirteen states at the time were ruled by a Confederation Government that was only unified by the Articles of Confederation. Each state remained sovereign and could govern its own way.\nCongress didn’t have any power to tax\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that the 13 colonies revolted primarily due to taxation without representation. The British imposed various taxes such as the Stamp Act and the Tea Act, which the colonists strongly opposed. They felt that being taxed without having representation in the British Parliament was unjust. Other factors included the British policies like the Proclamation of 1763, which restricted westward expansion, and the general desire for independence that grew over time. \n\n<answer> taxation without representation </answer>\n\nThe key issue was taxation without representation, which fueled the desire for independence among the colonists."

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> I need to check the reasons why unemployment is considered an economic problem. </think>\n<search> why is unemployment an economic problem </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Why Is Unemployment a Problem? - Reference.com\") Why Is Unemployment a Problem?\nUnemployment is a problem because it can create losses of income, increases in expenditures and societal problems that negatively affect individuals and society as a whole. Costs generated by unemployment are considered dead losses as they do not create any gains or benefits.\nAt the individual level, unemployment has both immediate and long-term effects. In the short term, an unemployed individual faces a diminished standard of living due to a reduction or elimination of income. In the long term, individuals may also lose professional skills and suffer negative effects to both mental and physical health.\nProlonged unemployment can also cause a rise in protectionist and anti-immigration tendencies in society. A shift towards protectionist tendencies can result in a damaged or hampered economy. High rates of unemployment have also been observed to correlate with a rise in crime rates and lowered volunteerism. Individuals who have been unemployed for long periods of time may choose to engage in criminal activities to either fulfill financial needs or combat boredom.\nUnemployment generally generates a financial cost to the country, as governments are forced to distribute higher amounts of unemployment benefits or food assistance. While the country’s expenditure increases, its income also drops as it can no longer collect the same level of income tax, due to less of the population being employed.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Why Is Unemployment A Economic Problem? - Blurtit\") Wow crime no offense...that's not correct. When people don't have a job they don't buy things and when they don't buy things businesses don't do so well and when businesses don't do well they have to in turn lay off more people which starts the process all over again. Also, people can't afford to pay bills so other companies aren't making money there as well. It's like one big circle. Then when businesses aren't doing so well they have less money to pour into our economy and our government can't tax as much leading to a shortage of gold toilet seats they can buy...that one was a joke. But you see where I am coming from. If people do not have money the businesses don't have money and if the businesses and people don't have money the government doesn't have money. That's the easiest way to look at it.\nThe main impact unemployment has on society and the economy is the productive power that it withholds - i.e. Any person who is unemployed could be doing something productive and thus contributing to the economy as a whole.\nBecause crime generally comes from the loss of employment which unfortunately marks the society for greater crimes taking place. When unemployment is on the rise in any State, Country and/or Locale it generally places families in a hardship situation that causes them to seek other methods of survival that are normally not their usual way(s) of life. Therefore, unfortunately crime normally takes place, which causes the Economy to suffer because so many people, consumers, businesses, environments will suffer due to the high rise in crime that normally comes from long-term unemployment.\nThe only impact unemployment can make in any economy is to drag the country down\nWhen the unemployment rate goes up, the economy is in effect throwing away the goods and services that the unemployed workers could have produced. During recessions, it is as if vast quantities of automobiles, clothing, and other commodities were simply dumped into the ocean.\nHow much waste results from high unemployment? What is the opportunity cost of recession? A survey provides a calculation of how far output fell short of potential gross domestic product during the major periods of high unemployment over the last half-century.

The last decade has been one of unprecedented stability in the United States, with very small business cycle losses.\nThe economic losses during periods of high unemployment are the greatest documented wastes in a modern economy. There are many times larger than the estimated inefficiencies from microeconomic waste due to monopoly or than the waste induced by tariffs and quotas.

Unemployment can lead to financial hardship, social isolation, and mental health problems. It can also strain relationships, increase crime rates, and lead to political instability.\nThis article brings and discusses the main issues/effects of unemployment on our society and economy.\nThe Cost of Unemployment – Economic\nSome of the well-known effects of unemployment on the economy are:\n1.) Unemployment financial costs\nThe government and the nation suffer. In many countries, the government has to pay the unemployed some benefits.\nThe greater the number of the unemployed or the longer they are without work, the more money the government has to shell out. Therefore, the nation not only has to deal with the lost income and decreased production but also with additional costs.\n2.) Spending power\nThe spending power of an unemployed person and his/her family decreases drastically, and they would rather save than spend their money, which, in turn, affects the economy adversely.\n3.) Reduced spending power of the employed\nIncreased taxes and the insecurity about their own work may affect the spending power of the working people as well, and they too may start to spend less than before, thus affecting the economy and also the society in a negative manner.\n4.) Recession\nWith the increase rates of unemployment, other economic factors are significantly affected, such as the income per person, health costs, quality of health care, standard of living, and poverty.\nAll these affects not just the economy but the entire systems and society in general.\nThe effect of unemployment on our society\nUnemployment affects not just the person himself but also his/her family and, in the long run, the society where he lives.\nUnemployment brings with it despair, unhappiness, and anguish. It forces people to live their lives in a way they do not wish to – life expectancy is negatively affected.\nLife expectancy is the ease by which people living in a time/place are able to satisfy their needs/wants. Here are the main aspects:\n1. Mental health: Mental health problems like low self-confidence, feeling unworthy, depression, and hopelessness.\nWith the lost income and the frustration involved in it, the recently unemployed may develop negative attitudes toward common things in life and may feel that all sense of purpose is lost. Frequent emotions could be low self-esteem, inadequateness, and feeling dejected and hopeless.\n2. Health diseases: The overall tension of unemployment can increase dramatically general health issues of individuals.\n3. Tension at home: Quarrels and arguments at home front which may lead to tension and increased numbers of divorces, etc.\n4. Political issues: Loss of trust in the administration and the government which may lead to political instability.\n5. Tension over taxes rise: Unemployment also brings discontent and frustration amongst the tax-paying citizens. In order to meet the demands of the unemployment fund, the government many times may have to increase taxes, thus giving way to restlessness amongst the tax-paying citizens.\n6. Insecurity amongst employees: The prevailing unemployment and the plight of the unemployed people and their families may create fear and insecurity even in the currently employed people.\n7. Crime and violence: Increase in the rate of crime.\n8. Suicide cases: Increase in the rate of suicide attempts and actual suicides as well.\n9. Social outing: Unemployment may bring a decrease in social outings and interactions with other people, including friends.\n10. Stigma: Unemployment brings more than just ‘no work’. It also brings with it the disgrace that the person has to bear. Nobody likes to be termed as unemployed.\n11. Standard of living: In times of unemployment, the\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Effects of Unemployment on Society and the Economy\") workforce, it hampers overall economic growth and development. Society misses out on the innovations and productivity that a fully employed population can generate.\nSummary\nAddressing the negative impacts of unemployment requires a comprehensive approach that includes not only economic policies to stimulate job creation but also social support systems, mental health services, and initiatives aimed at reducing inequality and promoting inclusive growth.\nBy addressing the multifaceted effects of unemployment, societies can strive for greater well-being and prosperity for all.\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Effects of Unemployment on Society and the Economy\") decrease in social outings and interactions with other people, including friends.\n10. Stigma: Unemployment brings more than just ‘no work’. It also brings with it the disgrace that the person has to bear. Nobody likes to be termed as unemployed.\n11. Standard of living: In times of unemployment, the competition for jobs and the negotiation power of the individual decreases, and thus also the living standard of people with reduced salary packages and income.\n12. Employment gaps: To further complicate the situation, the longer the individual is out of a job, the more difficult it becomes to find one.\nEmployers find employment gaps a negative aspect. No one wants to hire a person who has been out of work for some time, even when there’s no fault of the individual per se.\n13. Loss of skills’ usage: The unemployed are not able to put their skills to use. And in a situation where it goes on for too long, the person may have to lose some of his/her skills.\nSocial and Psychological Impacts of Unemployment\nApart from the economic consequences, unemployment also has significant social and psychological impacts on individuals and society as a whole.\nHere are some additional effects worth considering:\n1. Social isolation:\nUnemployment can lead to social isolation as individuals may withdraw from social interactions due to feelings of shame, embarrassment, or the inability to participate in activities that require financial resources.\nThis isolation can have detrimental effects on mental health and overall well-being.\n2. Strained relationships:\nFinancial strain and the stress associated with unemployment can strain relationships with family, friends, and partners.\nThe inability to contribute financially and fulfill social roles may lead to conflicts and strained dynamics within households.\n3. Skill deterioration:\nLong-term unemployment can result in a loss of skills and knowledge.\nWithout opportunities to utilize and enhance their skills, individuals may experience a decline in their professional abilities, making it more challenging to re-enter the workforce and contributing to a cycle of prolonged unemployment.\n4. Loss of social identity:\nWork provides individuals with a sense of purpose, identity, and belonging within society.\nWhen unemployed, individuals may experience a loss of social identity, feeling disconnected from the productive and valued roles they once held. This loss can impact self-esteem and overall psychological well-being.\n5. Generational impacts:\nUnemployment can have intergenerational effects, particularly when young individuals struggle to enter the job market or experience long periods of unemployment early in their careers.\nThis can hinder their long-term prospects, limit earning potential, and perpetuate cycles of poverty and unemployment within families.\n6. Increased inequality:\nUnemployment exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities within society.\nCertain marginalized groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, often face higher rates of unemployment and greater challenges in finding employment opportunities.\n7. Strain on public resources:\nHigh levels of unemployment place a burden on public resources, including social welfare programs and healthcare systems.\nGovernments must allocate significant funds to support the unemployed, provide job training, and address the social consequences of unemployment, which can strain public finances.\n8. Lost human potential:\nUnemployment represents a loss of human potential for both individuals and society.\nWhen individuals are unable to contribute their skills, knowledge, and talents to the workforce, it hampers overall economic growth and development. Society misses out on the innovations and productivity that a fully employed population can generate.\nSummary\nAddressing the negative impacts of unemployment requires a comprehensive approach that includes not only economic policies to s\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, unemployment is an economic problem because it leads to a loss of income and productivity, increased government spending on benefits, decreased consumer spending, and can lead to recession.

In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art. There is no denying the power of Picasso’s creative mind, and the effects of his stylistic experimentation in Cubism shaped the artistic movements that followed him. As an artist who would come to influence so many artists himself, Picasso is a pillar in the modern art world with a fascinating life full of inspiration.\nFrom https://news.masterworksfineart.com/2019/11/28/what-was-picassos-inspiration .\n* As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Who Were Pablo Picasso's Influences? - Reference.com\") Who Were Pablo Picasso’s Influences?\nSome of the artist’s major influences were Edvard Munch, Henri Toulouse de Lautrec, Paul Cézanne, Henri Rousseau and Georges Braque, who worked with Picasso to found the school of Cubism. Classically trained in the European school, Picasso emerged as a symbolist, drawing on Impressionism through Munch and Post-Impressionism via Lautrec. From Cézanne and Rousseau, he learned about archaic and tribal art, which led him toward Cubism.\nPicasso strove to define his place in the history of painting from the outset of his long career. Art historians consider his late works direct dialogues with Old Masters such as Velazquez, Goya and Rembrandt. He lived most of his life in France, so Picasso knew the latest trends and schools of art. Accordingly, he studied Symbolism, which worked to build a visual language of the soul from imagery drawn from mythology and dreams. Picasso also drew on Impressionist Munch to explore the nature of souls. Clearly Lautrec influenced his palette and his choice of subjects – prostitutes and the poor – during his Blue period, so-called because of his blue and gray palette. In fact, much of Picasso’s early work experiments with color – beginning in 1897 in violet and green through the Blue and consequent Rose period and his orange and red palette. This led him to experiment with shape as well, following Cezanne – Post-Impressionism influenced by primitive art – and Rousseau – experiments in Naïve art. Picasso began to use more angular shapes and figures, as well as more color, as he worked toward founding cubism with Braque, where the artist analyzes a subject or shape, disassembles it, then reassembles it in an abstracted form. Working in cubism led Picasso to invent collage and work toward a second form of Cubism (synthetic) where artists worked in mixed media.\nDoc 3(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") Pablo Picasso*, born in 1881 in Malaga, Spain, and died in 1973 in Mougins, France, was an active artist for most of his long life. His father was an artist himself, was Picasso’s first and most formative art teacher. Picasso has one of the most prolific creative careers in history, and his work was not only loved by art lovers around the world, but it was also incredibly influential for artists everywhere. But what was Picasso’s inspiration? What inspired these famous works?\nPicasso went through many creative phases in his career. These phases have been labeled as “periods” and show the different styles and mediums he was experimenting with during that time in his life. Picasso's “Blue Period” started in 1901 and lasted until 1904. During this period, Picasso painted mostly in cool blue and green tones, sometimes using a warmer color to accent his works. These pieces have a melancholy about them, and are quite somber, featuring scenes of poverty and desolation. What was Picasso’s inspiration to start painting in this way? In the spring of 1901, one of Picasso’s dear friends, a painter and poet named Carlos Casagemas, committed suicide in a cafe in Paris. Picasso was deeply affected by his death, and sank into a depression that lasted several years. Picasso’s journey through his grief and depression is clearly reflected in his “Blue Period.”\nIn 1904, Picasso moved to Montmartre in Paris, and settled into the community of bohemian artists and creators there. Coming out of his depression over his friend’s death, Picasso moved on from dark and serious subjects in his paintings to more lighthearted compositions featuring harlequins, clowns and carnival performers. His color palette warmed up as well, with his paintings now bathed in reds, oranges, pinks and earth tones. This period would be known as Picasso's “Rose Period” and it lasted until 1906. So what can be credited with this major shift in his work? Picasso met a woman named Fernande Olivier in 1904 and they began a relationship that lasted seven years. Olivier would be the first of a long line of women who were muses and lovers to Picasso over the years. This relationship and the end of his bout of depression signaled a more positive phase of Picasso’s life. The overall tone of his work during this period is much more carefree and less somber.\nCiting beautiful women as inspiration would become a theme in Picasso’s life, all the way up until his death. Picasso has been quoted saying: “For me there are only two kinds of women, goddesses and doormats.” He often became obsessed with a young woman and she became an artistic muse for him, inspiring many works. All of the women Picasso took as either wives or lovers were painted by the artist. His second wife Jacqueline Roque was the subject of over 400 portraits by Picasso, and was a great source of inspiration to him.\nFrom 1906-1909 Picasso was heavily inspired by African art, after he was exposed to traditional African masks and other art objects coming from Africa into French museums in Paris. This phase has been called his “African Period,” and was a precursor to his most famous period, “Cubism.” Influenced by Paul Cezanne’s experimentation with three-dimensional spacing and perspective, Picasso and Georges Braque pioneered the artistic movement known as Cubism. This way of breaking down a form to its most basic forms and reconstructing them in an abstracted way is what Picasso is most known for.\nSo what can we say was Picasso's inspiration?\nThroughout his life, Picasso's inspiration came in many different forms. Whether it be working through his emotions, responding to a difficult life event, meeting a beautiful young woman, an intense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art.

What it does mean is that our regional industrial and commercial growth is critical for us to have strong local political leadership,” he said.\n“In many respects, our political leaders struggle with regionalism because they are elected to serve the needs of county and city taxpayers, and that is totally reasonable. That’s why the business community, which does not have those political boundaries, has to lead this effort.”\nAnd Johnson City Vice Mayor Jenny Brock said regionalism is not a threat to a city’s or county’s unique identity.\n“I see just the opposite. Each location has a unique value proposition that adds to the culture of the region. These unique features add energy and color to any regional experience,” she said.\n_______\nMiles Burdine/Bob Feathers, Kingsport Chamber of Commerce: “The benefits of regionalism include being recognized nationally as one large community. It puts our regional community on the map so everyone will know where we are and, in many ways, who and what we are.”\nLottie Ryans, First Tennessee Development District : “We are stronger with greater ideas for growth or solving problems when we work across the region. We showcase a greater depth and breadth of opportunity in all aspects of life.”\nJohn Clark, Kingsport mayor: “The benefits of regionalism allow for all interested partners to work together for a common cause. … The drawbacks of regionalism include the possibility for each individual city or county to lose their respective independence and/or identity.”\nJenny Brock, Johnson City vice mayor: “The outside world does not see city or county boundary lines when they are making a decision to locate in our area. They look for an area with offerings they need or want.”\nBeth Rhinehart, Bristol Chamber of Commerce president: “The greatest benefit is improved economic vitality of the entire region, over time. When our region is vibrant, so are the individual communities within that region.”\nSteve Smith, Food City president and CEO: “Regionalism encourages cooperation and partnerships while making possible feats that ordinarily might not be possible to affect individually.”\nDoc 3(Title: \"What are the benefits of regionalism and what are the drawbacks ...\") More wins for everyone.\nThat’s the biggest benefit of regionalism, according to Clay Walker, CEO of NETWORKS — Sullivan Partnership. But he adds this condition, “When done properly.”\nMost drawbacks to regionalism, Walker said, are connected to how a regional initiative is executed.\n“For example, the effort must be fair and inclusive, involving the proper people. It must also honor each of the partner communities’ own identity and branding efforts and find a common message that doesn’t compete with any of those brands.”\nYou’ve got to be able to compete\nWhen business and community leaders talk about the benefits of regionalism, they mention being able to compete with other regions of the country for business and industry, they cite more efficient use of tax dollars and better opportunities to solve problems.\n“Regionalism encourages cooperation and partnerships, while making possible feats that ordinarily might not be attainable and creates opportunities that may not otherwise be available,” said Steve Smith, president and CEO of Food City. “There are very few, if any, drawbacks to regionalism, when implemented properly.”\nKen Maness points out that the region has undertaken significant joint projects in the past, most notably the creation of Tri-Cities Airport, and more recently, banding together to support the creation of Ballad Health.\n“Regionalism in our area has been around for a long time. We will benefit as it strengthens,” said Maness, a former Kingsport alderman who now serves on the Tri-Cities Airport Authority. “The path to regionalism is easier when a strong common bond and clear regional identity exists. In the Tri Cities, we have a bond based on proximity to each other, creating economic interdependence, while facing challenges as remote outposts to our state governments.”\nJerry Caldwell, Bristol Motor Speedway executive vice president and general manager, said his organization sees firsthand the “amazing things” that can be accomplished when the region pulls together.\n“We at Bristol Motor Speedway are very fortunate to be an international destination and have very strong support from everyone in this region. We are not able to put on the events that we host without that support of everyone in the region,” he said.\nOn the national stage\nBeing nationally recognized as one large community “much like the Research Triangle in North Carolina or Silicon Valley in California” is another big benefit of regionalism, according to Miles Burdine and Bob Feathers of the Kingsport Chamber of Commerce. Burdine is the chamber’s president and Feathers is chamber board chair. They responded together to the newspaper’s questions.\n“It puts our regional community on the map so everyone will know where we are and, in many ways, who and what we are,” they said.\nRegionalism is also the acceptance of a hard truth, according to Jon Smith, Tri-Cities Airport Authority chairman and East Tennessee State University director of the Bureau of Business & Economics Research.\n“When it comes to attracting industry, smaller urban centers are at a significant disadvantage when competing against larger cities,” he said.\nFor cities and counties in smaller regions to compete with larger communities, they have to work together, Smith said.\n“It is the surest way of achieving regionwide economic growth that will increase the prosperity of the region’s residents and achieve economic development that will enhance our quality of life while preserving the amenities and culture that make the region unique.”\nIdentity crisis\nThe drawback to regionalism most voiced addressed a community’s fear of losing its unique identity, its “sense of place, sense of community,” said Margaret Feierabend, Bristol, Tenn., mayor.\nBristol Chamber of Commerce President Beth Rhinehart said, “There is an innate fear for some that regionalism means our own community’s identity and interests will no longer matter.”\nSome people worry that regionalism means giving up local political control o\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Impact of Corruption on the Effectiveness of Public ...\") rd University Press, USA.\n[13]- Whitton, H.

Cows in today’s dairy industry are given utmost veterinary care in order to ensure that they are free from any illness. It is also important to monitor their health in order to ensure that the illness isn’t going to spread into the entire herd. Vaccination and proper monitoring are just some of the most important practices in today’s modern dairy industry.\nFor instance, it is important that the sick cow is going to show no trace of antibiotics in her milk. Milk with traces of antibiotics is not allowed to be sold in the market today.\nThere are basically a lot of new innovations and technologies in today’s dairy industry. The industry now has a better understanding of exactly how to meet the demands of their consumers. Even though only 2% of the entire population works in dairy farms, they are still able to cater to the world’s demand for dairy-related products. Thanks to modern day practices from the industry, consumers are also safer when they consume their dairy products.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Dairy Farming: What Is It? And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") lly damaging industry, and aside from the fact it makes so many people who consume it sick, dairying affects people in another important way. When we overproduce milk we are being recklessly wasteful of land, water, feed and farmers’ time. Wouldn’t these vital resources be better used in the production of nutritious plant-based foods that are sustainable and essential for optimal health?\nInstead of situating these damaging animal-based industries among poor, underserved communities, often predominantly inhabited by people of color, wouldn’t it be better to grow healthful plant foods that can be made locally available? ‘Food deserts’ is a term commonly used for areas where affordable, healthful food is in short supply, but food justice activists instead talk about ‘food apartheid’, as this issue connects directly to a systemic racism inherent in the food system.\nThere is much that is damaging about the dairy industry, and that is before we even talk about the cows themselves.\nHow Are Cows Treated On Dairy Farms?\nCows are treated as though they are inanimate machinery – you turn on a tap and out comes the milk.\nAs we know, cows produce milk only when they are pregnant, as their breast milk is intended for their babies. Every day that pregnancy is delayed is a day’s loss of milk, and so pregnancy is not left to chance. Cows are artificially inseminated which involves one human hand entering the cow’s anus to manipulate her cervix into position while the other hand inserts a tube of semen into her vagina. Suddenly, milk doesn’t seem quite so wholesome, does it?\nWhen the babies are born, they are taken from their mothers so they don’t actually drink the milk that was made for them. Cows show extreme distress at this separation, often bellowing with grief as any mother would. Cows have been known to break out of farms and trek for miles in search of their calves, such is the strength of their determination and love. And spare a thought for the calves themselves. Newborns need their mothers, and yet they are taken forcibly, and either killed or isolated. Their mothers can only look on and cry out for this to stop but it will happen again and again, as that is the only way to keep the milk flowing.\nIn CAFOs, cows who are naturally grazing animals and have four distinct areas of their stomachs to help them digest grass, are denied access to pasture. They are also denied stimulation, and have nothing to do all day but stand, eat and be milked. And suffer. Standing around is not pain-free when you consider the prevalence of lameness on America’s dairy farms to be up to 55 percent.\nAnd there is an immense biological price to pay for being near-constantly pregnant while simultaneously milked. No wonder, cows break down when still so very young. When they can no longer produce as much milk as is demanded of them, they are trucked to slaughter. It’s not a problem for the farmer, as there are always plenty of female calves who can take the place of their mothers, until they too collapse under the emotional, psychological and physical strain of being a dairy cow.\nIs Dairy Farming Cruel?\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer physically. As well as lameness, there is a high incidence of clinical mastitis – a painful infection of the teats usually caused by bacteria transmitted during the milking process or through living in filthy surroundings. It is so common that it occurs in all dairy herds. Mastitis is extraordinarily painful, and each day, every day, the cows’ infected teats are inserted into machinery to have the milk drawn from them.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer psychologically. Cows are intelligent, sentient beings, with individual personalities, the ability to learn and display long-term memory. They even remember those who have handled them roughly. Cows have needs and desires, but in modern intensive farms they are afforded nothing that makes their lives worthwhile.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer emotion\nDoc 3(Title: \"Dairy Farming: What Is It? And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") ividual personalities, the ability to learn and display long-term memory. They even remember those who have handled them roughly. Cows have needs and desires, but in modern intensive farms they are afforded nothing that makes their lives worthwhile.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer emotionally. Is there anything more cruel than forcing someone to be pregnant then stealing away the baby so you can harvest their milk? When put in simple terms, dairy production sounds like something out of The Handmaid’s Tale.\nDairy farming must rank among the cruelest industries on the planet.\nDairy Farming Facts\nHere are ten things you may not know about the dairy industry.\n- The veal industry is inextricably tied to the dairy industry. If you hate the thought of a baby animal being confined, chained, deliberately kept weak and anemic and slaughtered young, it’s not enough to boycott veal. You need to boycott milk, too.\n- In some states it is still legal to remove the tails of dairy cows. A survey of 113 North Central and North Eastern US dairies found that tail docking was practiced at 82.3 percent of the dairies.\n- Tie stalls – where cows may be tethered continuously – are the primary form of housing on 39 percent and 75 percent of US and Canadian dairy farms, respectively.\n- The hairs around cows’ udders may be burned off using a propane torch. The industry admits that some cows ‘react’ to this shocking procedure.\n- Dairy farmers in the US can still use the growth hormone bovine somatotropin (bST) to boost milk yields. It also increases the risk of mastitis, lameness, indigestion and diarrhoea in cows, and is banned in the EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Argentina.\n- Journey times for US dairy cows being taken to slaughter can be up to 28 punishing hours without rest.\n- When a cow is suffering from mastitis, neutrophils end up in the milk – these are the inflammatory immune cells that cause pus. In the European Union, the legal limit is set at 300,000 cells per ml of milk. In the United States, it is more than double at 750,000 cells per ml. But how much pus in your latte is too much?\n- Antibiotics and pesticides are also ‘prevalent’ in retail cows’ milk. As is pus.\n- Gastroenterologist Dr. Angie Sadeghi says that milk is ‘such poison to our gut’.\n- Oxford University researchers found that the most sustainable dairy milk was still worse for the planet than the least sustainable plant milks. Their advice? Choose plant milks.\nConclusion\nThere can be no more ruthless industry than the dairy industry. Animals are exploited for their reproductive capabilities, and their young are simply disposed of. It’s an industry that trashes the environment, causes immense suffering to gentle, sentient beings, and makes people sick.\nNo wonder, sales of milk are declining as people abandon this cruel, damaging ‘poison’, and choose plant milks instead.\nFind out more about making healthy, compassionate food choices by trying vegan for 7 or 30 days HERE.\nAre plant milks expensive where you live?

Check out these simple recipes and you’ll never go back!\nDoc 4(Title: \"How does the modern dairy industry work? - Best in Australia\") There are a lot of things that have changed in the dairy industry today. For instance, during the 1800s, there were several issues found in milk. Poor sanitation and our poor understanding of microorganisms have caused several milk-borne diseases to become rampant. In 1862, French scientist Louis Pasteur showed a method that could eliminate the risk. Later known as pasteurisation, it has changed the way the industry operates.\nAlso, in 1890, Henry Coit together with other physicians established The Medical Milk Commission that certified the overall safety of consumer milk. By the time when industrial agriculture evolved, the operations of the dairy industry also changed significantly as huge operations became dominant.\nModern day practices in today’s dairy industry\nFrom the 1800s to today, things have changed significantly for the dairy industry. There are modern-day practices that can be considered a huge leap from the old dairy practices.\nSelective breeding\nThough considered to be a highly controversial topic, there are dairies that have practiced selective breeding among cows in order to get the shape of the leg that they need. In some cases, it also led to better production of milk.\nArtificial insemination\nAnother practice in today’s dairy industry is artificial insemination. It is today’s most common method of reproductive management in different parts of the world. In 1996, it was reported in the US that 45% of dairy operations have already used artificial insemination over having a breeding bull.\nThis has improved milk production and has resulted in the desired cattle by most farms. It also led to genetically elite sires and an increased conception rate. Conception rate among dairies that have practiced artificial insemination is at around more or less 40%.\nHigh standards for milk\nUnlike the old times when people get sick when they drink milk, the industry now has a high standard when it comes to the quality of milk that they allow in the market.\nMilk quality is synonymous with the somatic cell count (SCC) as well as bacterial count coming from the pre-pasteurised bulk tank milk. Different countries have set different allowable maximum somatic cell counts. In the US, the upper limit for SCC is at 750,000 cells per 1ML whereas it is 500,000 cells/ML for Canada.\nRapid advancement in nutrition\nNutrition has also advanced in today’s dairy processes. For instance, when it comes to lactating cows, they are fed with component-based ration or total mixed ration. The content of the ration is based on research as well as laboratory testing. For dairy nutritionists, a good combination of hay, grains, and protein sources in cows are important.\nWhen it comes to the diet of most cows, it usually depends on the surplus items in the area. For Florida, for instance, a good amount of citrus pulp and brewer’s mash has been incorporated in cow feed mainly because of the orange production in the state. It becomes a nutritious diet for cows instead of ending up as landfill.\nWater is also another important component of a cow’s diet. Farmers today ensure that their cows get access to clean water all the time given the fact that these animals can consume approximately around 95 to 190 litres of water daily.\nFree range vs. small spaces\nUnfortunately, there are a good number of farms that have confined their animals in small spaces. On the other hand, there are those farms that have reverted towards free-range practices wherein cows are free to roam and eat grass.\nPart of the reason why free-range cows are becoming popular is the fact that cows that roam freely require less medical attention than cows found in “animal factories”. Those cows that are placed in small spaces usually take antibiotics not only to grow faster but to compensate for their living conditions.\nHealthcare\nFarms now pay close attention to the overall health of their cows. Cows in today’s dairy industry are given utmost veterinary care in order to ensure that they are free from\nDoc 5(Title: \"Dairy Farming: What Is It? And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") What could be more natural than a fully grown weaned adult human being drinking the breast milk of a different species? When put like that, it does sound a little weird doesn’t it? So how did drinking cows’ milk become so normalised? It is natural? And why don’t we drink the milk of dogs or moose… or whales? After all, they produce milk for their young, too. As soon as you start to ask why we drink milk, a thousand more questions pop right up.\nHistory Of Dairy Farming\nHumans didn’t always drink the milk of another species. After childhood (which is when all other mammals stop drinking milk) our ancient ancestors simply couldn’t digest it, and even today most adults worldwide still do not produce the enzyme lactase which is needed to digest the milk sugar, lactose.\nHowever, most Europeans do have this gene, and this genetic change in homo sapiens came into being around 7,500 years ago. With the ability to actually digest the white stuff without getting sick, their health improved, largely for two reasons. First, it meant that communities were no longer quite so reliant on crops that could fail, and second, milk was less likely to harm them than their local contaminated water supplies.\nThe co-evolution of milk tolerance and dairy-farming went hand-in-hand until today when there are 264 million cows in dairy farms all over the world. And yet, almost 100 percent of people with Asian, African and Native American ancestry develop lactose intolerance by adulthood, while in Black communities, the incidence is over 70 percent. Those who do consume dairy can experience bloating, diarrhea and abdominal cramps, and they may not even know what is causing it.\nWhat’s going on? Why are there so many cows and so much milk when so few people can digest it? The answer can be found in the phrases ‘cash cow’ and ‘white gold’. That’s right. Milk is aggressively marketed to people, even though it makes them sick, because others make money from it.\nWhat Is a Dairy Farming?\nIt is utilising and exploiting the reproductive systems of cows (and less commonly sheep and goats), in order to mass produce a product that is sold for consumption.\nSo, why do we milk cows and not dogs or moose or whales? It has nothing to do with the taste or suitability of the product. It’s just that cows are bigger and so make more milk than dogs, and they are more easily domesticated than moose or whales. It really is that simple.\nHow a Dairy Farm Works\nCows don’t naturally produce milk. Like all mammals, they must first be made pregnant, and the breast milk their bodies make is intended to feed their young. To ensure near-constant production, farmed cows are repeatedly made pregnant through artificial insemination. They are selectively-bred for optimal milk yield, despite the toll it takes on the animals – painfully distended udders, teat infections and lameness are all commonplace in modern-day dairies. Still, we are never satisfied. We want every ounce of milk from each cow, and we cannot spare even a drop for the calf for whom the milk was made. Besides, it’s the milk we want, not the baby, and so the young animals are taken from their mothers soon after birth to stop them drinking that valuable liquid. Both mother and calf grieve for days at this devastating separation, as any parent and child would.\nThe newborn females may be taken and isolated inside a hutch. Unable to nuzzle their mothers or find comfort in a herd, they are all alone, often chained, and able only to stand up or lie down until they are old enough to be impregnated and milked.\nThe males obviously can’t produce milk and as they are the wrong breed to put on muscle for beef, farmers won’t waste feed on them. Instead they may be raised for veal, chained inside crates and kept permanently weak, so their flesh is pale and tender.

    "question": "how has air pollution changed over time",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the documents provided, air pollution has changed over time with a mix of positive and negative trends. Historically, air pollution has been an issue for at least 2,100 years due to human activities. However, advancements in regulations and technologies have led to declines in certain pollutants in many high-income countries. For instance, emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 have decreased in the UK, and fewer than 20% of city residents in America are exposed to PM10 and PM2.5 levels above WHO guidelines. On the other hand, pollution levels have increased in some low and middle-income countries like India, China, and Greece. Globally, death rates from air pollution have nearly halved since 1990, primarily due to improvements in indoor pollution rather than outdoor pollution. While the U.S. and China are major contributors to carbon emissions, efforts are ongoing to address these issues. Overall, air pollution remains a significant global challenge, especially in low and middle-income regions. </think>\n\n<answer> Air pollution has changed over time with a mix of positive and negative trends. </answer>\n\nAfter detailing the historical context and current status of air pollution, it succinctly captures the essence without repeating extensive details.",

By extracting layers of ice which have accumulated in Greenland over many millennia and analysing the methane trapped within them, scientists have been able to link increased levels with activity we know civilisations such as the Ancient Romans and the Han Dynasty in China were undertaking at the time.\nDespite humans being aware of pollution for many decades (and having caused it for many more), our knowledge has grown exponentially over the last 50 years. So too have the efforts to reverse the trend by environmental groups, scientists, Governments and world leaders. Since Filtermist first began producing oil mist filters to help workplaces reduce their emissions in 1969, we have seen huge developments – but there are still regions of the world where pollution levels are increasing far above those acceptable as set down by legislation, and there are still individuals and employers who don’t comprehend the full scale of the problem and the negative impacts of pollutants like oil mist and dust.\nAir pollution is defined as a ‘mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both inside and outside’ – excess pollution has an impact on the environment (including contributing to rising temperatures across the globe) and humans too: through diseases caused by poor air quality. Hundreds of thousands of deaths each year are attributed to pollutants.\nIn this guide, we take a look at how emission levels, our knowledge and the regulations have changed in the past 50 years since Filtermist launched – and what could happen in the future if they are not reversed.\nEmissions over the years:\nThere are many different substances which class as air pollution when released into the atmosphere, including carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter (PM). The latter has been the primary concern of Filtermist since its inception 50 years ago, given this category includes oil mist particles which can be emitted as a by-product of various metal machining processes across multiple industries. PM can be divided into categories depending on the size of each individual particle: PM10 comprises of particles less than 10µm which can enter the lungs when inhaled, while PM2.5 can permeate the gas-exchange regions of the lungs and enter into the blood stream.\nSince the 1970s, the majority of countries have seen a decline in exposure to PM2.5, at least partially thanks to stricter regulations. But countries including India, China and Greece have all seen an increase3. In the UK, emissions have dropped significantly from 639,000 tonnes of PM10 and 498,000 tonnes of PM2.5 each year to 169,000 and 106,000 respectively.\nIn America, fewer than 20 per cent of city residents are exposed to PM10 and PM2.5 levels above the WHO Air Quality Guidelines. In higher-income countries in Europe, more than 60 per cent are exposed to higher levels, rising to more than 90 per cent when we look at lower- and middle-income European countries. However, the situation is worse in the Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, South-East Asia, and lower- and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific where between 95 and 100 per cent of cities are exposed to these above-guideline levels.\nIt’s not just a minor problem either, some of the cities are exposed to levels between six and ten times what the guidelines advise is acceptable.\nLevels have undoubtedly risen over the past 50 years, even when comparing data from a much shorter period (2008 to 2013) there is an eight per cent rise in annual mean concentrations of PM2.5. While high-income regions have seen a decrease, there has been a marked increase in pollution levels in low and medium-income regions.\nRegulations:\nDoc 2(Title: \"Over the Last 43 Years Here's How Much Pollution We've Put Into the Air\") Over the Last 43 Years, Here's How Much Pollution We've Put Into the Air\nWhile pollution and its effect on climate change may be international problems, not all countries are equally at fault.\nDespite the changing international landscape and the rise of powerful industrial economies such in India and Russia, nearly half of the world's CO2 emissions can be squarely blamed on two countries: the U.S. and China.\nThe latter firmly cemented its leading status in 2007, although the U.S. emission levels are not looking any lower. Here is a map illustrating just how much CO2 emission these two countries dump on the rest of the world:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nCarbon emissions have been on the rise since 1971, with a steady annual increase of 2%. The global output is expected to rise by another 39% by 2030. In the U.S. alone, CO2 emissions have increased by 10% between 1999 and 2011.\nHow does that look compared to the rest of the world? Surprisingly enough, the global landscape of carbon emission has not changed much over the years. Here's a GIF simulating CO2 output in 1971:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nMost of the carbon emissions are concentrated in North America, Europe and East Asia, with the only noticeable outlier being South Africa.\nNow here is a version that illustrates how the carbon outputs look in 2011:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nThe most obvious increase is in China, which is covered by the CO2 clouds. Other countries that increased their presence on the map include Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India and Australia, while western Europe significantly cut down its output. But other than a few noticeable additions and eliminations, the distribution of carbon emission across the world looks remarkably similar to how it did back in 1971.\nIn pie chart form, it becomes even more telling just how much impact the U.S. and China's CO2 dump has on the rest of the world:\nImage Credit: EPA\nIn 2008, U.S. CO2 output was equal to India and 24 EU countries' combined output. As for China, it emitted as much CO2 as the U.S. and Japan combined.\nChina has been under a ton of pressure to deal with its insane air pollution problem, and it looks like its emissions may finally be slowing down. It's also drafting a comprehensive climate change bill to reform its energy policy. Chinese officials are considering a carbon tax, and by 2040, they want to reduce CO2 output by 40% of the 2005 levels.\nBut no matter how many doomsday scenarios are foretold, the U.S. remains frustratingly slow on curbing down carbon emission. Despite improved energy efficiency and increased popularity of alternative energy sources, the U.S. ended its recent CO2 decline streak with a 2% increase in 2013. But what can you expect from a country where politicians want to censor science and stop students from learning about climate change?\nDoc 3(Title: \"Air Pollution - Our World in Data\") across all countries of the world but with large differences in severity.\nIn the interactive map, we show death rates from air pollution across the world, measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 people in a given country or region.\nThe burden of air pollution tends to be greater across both low and middle-income countries for two reasons: indoor pollution rates tend to be high in low-income countries due to a reliance on solid fuels for cooking, and outdoor air pollution tends to increase as countries industrialize and shift from low to middle incomes.\nA map of the number of deaths from air pollution by country can be found here.\nHow are death rates from air pollution changing?\nDeath rates from air pollution are falling – mainly due to improvements in indoor pollution\nIn the visualization, we show global death rates from air pollution over time – shown as the total air pollution – in addition to the individual contributions from outdoor and indoor pollution.\nGlobally, we see that in recent decades, the death rates from total air pollution have declined: since 1990, death rates have nearly halved. But, as we see from the breakdown, this decline has been primarily driven by improvements in indoor air pollution.\nDeath rates from indoor air pollution have seen an impressive decline, while improvements in outdoor pollution have been much more modest.\nYou can explore this data for any country or region using the \"change country\" toggle on the interactive chart.\nKey Charts on Air Pollution\nSee all charts on this topicEndnotes\nMurray, C.

We made minor changes to the text in February 2024.\nAir pollution is one of the world's largest health and environmental problems. It develops in two contexts: indoor (household) air pollution and outdoor air pollution.\nIn this topic page, we look at the aggregate picture of air pollution – both indoor and outdoor. We also have dedicated topic pages that look in more depth at these subjects:\nIndoor Air Pollution\nLook in detail at the data and research on the health impacts of Indoor Air Pollution, attributed deaths, and its causes across the world\nOutdoor Air Pollution\nLook in detail at the data and research on exposure to Outdoor Air Pollution, its health impacts, and attributed deaths across the world\nEnergy\nLook in detail at the data and research on energy consumption, its impacts around the world today, and how this has changed over time\nSee all interactive charts on Air Pollution ↓\nOther research and writing on air pollution on Our World in Data:\n- Air pollution: does it get worse before it gets better?\n- Data Review: How many people die from air pollution?\n- Energy poverty and indoor air pollution: a problem as old as humanity that we can end within our lifetime\n- How many people do not have access to clean fuels for cooking?\n- What are the safest and cleanest sources of energy?\n- What the history of London’s air pollution can tell us about the future of today’s growing megacities\n- When will countries phase out coal power?\nAir pollution is one of the world's leading risk factors for death\nAir pollution is responsible for millions of deaths each year\nAir pollution – the combination of outdoor and indoor particulate matter and ozone – is a risk factor for many of the leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), in its Global Burden of Disease study, provides estimates of the number of deaths attributed to the range of risk factors for disease.1\nIn the visualization, we see the number of deaths per year attributed to each risk factor. This chart shows the global total but can be explored for any country or region using the \"change country\" toggle.\nAir pollution is one of the leading risk factors for death.

At the time, typical new cars were emitting nearly 13 grams per mile hydrocarbons (HC), 3.6 grams per mile nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 87 grams per mile carbon monoxide (CO). Since then, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set standards to bring down levels of these pollutants, and the auto industry has responded by developing new emission control technologies.\nOver time, Congress authorized EPA to regulate emissions from other mobile sources of air pollution, such as heavy-duty trucks, agricultural and construction equipment, locomotives, lawn and garden equipment, and marine engines. These milestones in controlling emissions from mobile sources involve a variety of approaches including technological advances in engine design to higher quality fuels. This integrated approach to mobile source emission control also depends on extensive collaboration between EPA; vehicle, engine, and fuel manufacturers; state and local governments; transportation planners; and individual citizens.\n1970\nCongress passes the first major Clean Air Act, requiring a 90 percent reduction in emissions from new automobiles by 1975. President Richard Nixon establishes EPA, and the new agency is given it broad responsibility for regulating motor vehicle pollution. New cars must meet EPA emission standards for hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx). The law also directs EPA to set health-based \"National Ambient Air Quality Standards\" for six pollutants.\n1971\nEPA begins testing the fuel economy of cars, trucks, and other vehicles, the first step towards informing consumers about the gas mileage of their vehicles.\n1972\nExhaust gas recirculation valves are developed as automakers strive to meet NOx standards.\n1973\nEPA creates new transportation controls in some of the nation’s largest cities, including Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, and others. Measures include exclusive bus lanes, bypass lanes for carpools and buses, parking garages and restrictions, and a mass transit incentive plan for California employers.\nEPA releases a study confirming that lead from automobile exhaust poses a direct threat to public health. Later that year, EPA issues final regulations to gradually reducing lead in gasoline.\n1975\nCongress passes the Energy Policy Conservation Act, setting the first fuel economy goals. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program establishes a phase-in of more stringent fuel economy standards beginning with 1975 model vehicles.\nThe \"first generation\" catalytic converters are built, significantly reducing vehicle emissions. Unleaded gasoline is also introduced because lead in gasoline may cause disintegration of catalytic converters. This results in dramatic reductions in ambient lead levels and alleviates many serious environmental and human health concerns associated with lead pollution.\n1977\nCongress amends the Clean Air Act which set a schedule for continued reductions in emissions from automobiles.\n1981\nNew cars meet the amended Clean Air Act standards for the first time. Sophisticated three-way catalysts with on-board computers and oxygen sensors appear in most new cars, helping to optimize the efficiency of the catalytic converter.\n1983\nInspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs are established in areas with air pollution problems, requiring passenger vehicles to undergo periodic testing for malfunctioning emission control systems.\n1985\nEPA sets stringent standards for emissions of NOx from heavy-duty engines and of PM from heavy-duty diesel-powered trucks and buses.\nEPA issues final regulations to cut the amount of lead in gasoline by 90 percent starting January 1, 1986. The new standard is 0.10 grams per gallon.\n1989\nFor the first time, EPA s\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the documents provided, air pollution has changed over time with a mix of positive and negative trends.

At the current pace of job growth, if sustained, this problem is set to get much worse,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement. “These labor shortages will only intensify across all industries and company sizes.”\nPrivate payrolls grew by 177,000 in June, a respectable number but below market expectations. It was the fourth month in a row that the ADP/Moody’s count fell short of 200,000 after four months at or above that level.\nThe reason for the tick down in hiring certainly isn’t because there aren’t enough jobs.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that April closed with 6.7 million job openings. May ended with just over 6 million people the BLS classifies as unemployed, continuing a trend this year that has seen openings eclipse the labor pool for the first time. At some point that gap will have to close. Economists expect that employers are going to have to start doing more to entice workers, likely through pay raises, training and other incentives.\n“Pressure is building for employers, and both hard data and anecdotal reports indicate that wage pressures are building,” Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said in a note. “With the economy still humming, employers are able to justify stronger wage increases to retain or attract talent, but it’s becoming a more challenging proposition.”\nAs employers face the pressure, the costs likely will end up getting passed on.\nMost inflation measures are at 2 percent or more now, and are likely to continue rising. Companies are reporting record profits, but could find themselves constrained by a double-short of inflation, both from wages and rising costs due to escalating trade tensions and tariffs between the U.S. and its trading partners.\n“How much might rising labor costs chew into corporate profits? How much will be passed through to customers in the form of higher prices? That remains to be seen,\" Baird said. \"Rising labor costs will boost take home pay, but we’re also all likely to see the effect in rising prices for goods and services.\"\nThose are all issues the Federal Reserve will have to weigh as well.\nThe U.S. central bank has been raising interest rates as it sees the economy growing and inflation meeting the Fed's 2 percent target. Fed officials have indicated they will be raising rates two more times in 2018, but the market has been skeptical, with traders assigning just a 51 percent chance of that happening.\nThe economy has \"bumped against the proverbial labor wall,\" David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff, said in his morning note Thursday. \"Inflation pressures will intensify and the Fed will be forced to act more aggressively, just as has been the case in the past. There is no Presidential Tweet that will stop Mother Nature from taking its course.\"\nDoc 2(Title: \"How Should Governments Address Inequality? | Foreign Affairs\") strating how trends in technology, trade, unionization, and minimum wages have shaped the fortunes of those Americans. Global labor-market forces have pushed up the demand for highly skilled workers and have led to steadily increasing wages for those with a college education. The same forces have led to declining or stagnant wages for those with lower levels of education. And a decline in unionization rates and the fall in the real value of the minimum wage have exacerbated the downward pressures on middle- and low-wage workers.\nLess well understood are the causes of the tremendous surge in income among extremely high earners, meaning the upper 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 percent. From a policymaking point of view, the most important question is how much of the ultrarich’s income reflects activity, such as technological innovation, that benefits the broader economy. The more of it that does, the greater the potential economic costs of raising taxes on the highest-income individuals. If, in contrast, the income of the biggest earners is produced by pursuits that are less broadly beneficial, such as high-frequency stock market trading, then higher taxes at the top would pose fewer economic costs. Either way, there are likely compelling reasons to raise the top income tax rates—as a way of funding public services and investing in infrastructure, for example. But policymakers would be able to make better decisions about “soaking the rich” if they had a clearer sense of the tradeoffs involved.\nOne of the most interesting facts uncovered by Piketty and others is that compared with the richest people and families in the early 1900s, when large fortunes often came from inherited assets, today’s superrich are acquiring a larger share of their income in the form of earnings. About 60 percent of the income of the top one percent in the United States today is labor income. A number of essays in After Piketty mention the rise of “supersalaries” or “supermanagers”: top executives of large corporations, primarily in the financial industry, who enjoy very generous compensation packages. Economists disagree, however, about whether the income earned by such executives reflects the efficient working of a market for talent, in which case their pay reflects their value, or whether the massive compensation packages result from a bargaining process that is shaped by regulations, institutions, and social norms.\nIn their contribution to the book, the economists Laura Tyson and Michael Spence highlight the role of technological developments in creating substantial economic rewards for those who possess specific skills and in reducing the employment security of less skilled workers. But Tyson and Spence also note that markets are imperfect and that compensation packages are not determined solely by market value. They point to a growing body of research indicating that income generated by patents and intellectual property protections and by the market power of brand names flows primarily to upper-level management and the owners of capital.\nIn contrast, in Piketty’s view, the primary factors driving the rise in executive pay at the top are not technology or imperfect markets but eroded social norms, questionable corporate-governance practices, and declining union power. Tyson and Spence favor more research to weigh the relative impact of market forces and institutional factors but argue that either explanation provides a strong rationale for increasing the marginal income tax rate for top earners in an effort to combat income inequality.\nONE FOR YOU, TWO FOR ME\nAnother essential set of questions about inequality centers on whether wealth concentration negatively affects economic growth, shared prosperity, and democratic institutions. In his contribution to After Piketty, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, outlines a number of ways in which it might. One such potential negative effect is reduced aggregate consumer spending.

This set a limit on how many immigrants from each country could enter the US every year. The Quota System made it so only 2% of a county's population could enter the US as immigrants each year. This mainly was to limit European immigration, and was successful in limiting immigration except from Mexico and Canada. During the 1920’s only about 38,000 Asian came into the United States.\nWhen the Immigrants got into America, most settled down and tried to find jobs.

By 2015, the rate for college-educated workers had fallen only slightly, to 94 percent, but the rate among less educated men had plummeted to just 83 percent. This drop reflects market forces and technological change, to be sure, but it also suggests shifting social norms and attitudes.\nHIGH AND NOT SO MIGHTY\nA growing body of evidence now indicates that inequality in the United States threatens to create intergenerational poverty traps, greatly reduce social mobility, and marginalize entire swaths of the population. Such effects are sure to have political ramifications. Piketty proposed that greater wealth inequality will increase the demand for egalitarian policy responses. But it also means that the wealthy, with their deeper-than-ever pockets, will be even better able to block such changes. Beyond that observation, Piketty doesn’t have much to say about the politics of inequality in the United States or elsewhere. As the social policy expert Elisabeth Jacobs points out in her contribution to After Piketty, politics is both “everywhere and nowhere” in Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-first Century: the problems Piketty identifies are inherently political, but he pays little attention to the crucial role that politics would play in any attempt to address them.\nUnfortunately, the same criticism applies to After Piketty. Many of the volume’s contributors assume that no matter what policy remedies for extreme inequality emerge, wealthy elites will marshal their considerable influence to maintain their position and privileges. But they do not explore those potential policies at great length, nor do they consider the precise mechanisms that would shape pushback from the elites.\nAfter Piketty would also have benefited from more discussion about whether recent political events challenge the notion that elites can overcome a wave of support for more redistribution of wealth. In 2016, the Brexit vote and the American presidential election revealed the strength of populist and nationalist sentiments among voters who gleefully rejected the elite classes in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Even in the wake of such surprising outcomes, the political economy models described in After Piketty tend to associate rising wealth concentration with growing political power of the elite—not the rise of populism. The watershed political events of 2016 call those models into question; in both the United Kingdom and the United States, elites saw their preferred choices lose out.\nE PLURIBUS UNUM?\nWhen it comes to the problem of income and wealth inequality in the United States, there are no silver bullets. But policymakers have many levers available to them. The best evidence suggests that the United States could have a more progressive federal income tax code without incurring substantial economic costs. Tax reform should focus on expanding the tax base by closing loopholes and eliminating regressive features such as the mortgage-interest tax deduction, which benefits only high-income homeowners, and the carried-interest loophole, which benefits only those involved in private-equity finance.\nThe federal government should take the additional revenue such steps would generate and invest it in programs that would increase the country’s economic potential. That would include improvements to public infrastructure, expanded access to high-quality childcare and preschool programs, and more spending on programs that assist economically disadvantaged youth. Government commitments to public universities and community colleges must be strengthened.

Its evolution into a feature film and many revivals emerged to become a reflection of African-American culture. As this franchise gets revisited during tonight's \"The Wiz Live!\" special on NBC, it would behoove us to recognize its contributions to entertainment and the influence of black performance art on pop culture 40 years later.\nThe tale of how 'The Wiz' went from an ambitious idea to almost not happening to becoming a seven Tony Award-winning Broadway hit is a microcosm of the perseverance of black people dreams in America. The brainchild of former disc jockey Ken Harper, The Wiz aimed to remix “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” from traditional Broadway play to a live stage performance with a Motown feel. In his presentation to Fox, Harper exhibited the foresight to promote the appeal that a musical inspired by black performing art could succeed in theaters across the country.\nIn a 1975 interview with Playbill, he recounted his sales pitch to Fox, saying \"You pick up Billboard or Cashbox\" any week, and what you’ll find is that five of the Top Ten songs on the charts are black. The message was clear. In this country, at this time, a certain kind of black music, the 'Motown Sound' sells, and it sells to everyone, black and white.\"\nThe show opened on October 21, 1974 at the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre in Baltimore and debuted on Broadway on January 5th, 1975. Despite a opening night fraught with technical issues and suggestions to quit while they were ahead, \"The Wiz, The Super Soul Musical 'Wonderful Wizard of Oz\"' received standing ovations and curtain calls. Mixed reviews be damned, Fox continued to support financially. Harper and his team utilized the funds to assemble a media blitz, trading airtime on radio for free tickets to shows and conducting as many interviews with the cast as possible.\nThe most fruitful promotion strategy for The Wiz emerged as a television ad of the cast reenacting the Yellow Brick Road scene, singing the paramount theme song “Ease On Down The Road”. Before long, the show would receive critical and commercial praise, resulting in seven Tony award wins in 1975, including “Best Musical.”\nThree years later brought the film adaptation, which wasn’t without its share of controversy. Stephanie Mills, the lead on Broadway was tapped to reprise her role as Dorothy, but a last minute power play from Diana Ross had her inserted into the role.\nAlthough the movie received critical disdain, it did not prevent it from attaining cult classic status. The Broadway production amassed a collection of talented individuals who, when given the platform, could deliver excellent performances. Although young and relative unknowns like Stephanie Mills (16, Dorothy) and Hinton Battle (18, Scarecrow) led the cast, they proved to be excellent options.\nThis cast also made history as George Faison became the first African-American choreographer to win a Tony. Also of note, the cast had familiar names as extras, most notable Phylicia Rashad (née Ayers-Allen). The film version of 'The Wiz' formed a mosaic of black excellence prevalent in 1978 and beyond. The ensemble included Diana Ross, Nipsey Russell, Mabel King, Richard Pryor, Lena Horne, and a young up and coming musician named Michael Jackson.\nUnlike films where popular actors are cast in films hoping that name recognition will translate to commercial success, The Wiz concocted a harmonious mix of talent greater than the sum of its parts. For anyone watching in 2015, the familiar faces resonate based upon more recent accomplishments.\nFans of “The Cosby Show,” “A Different World,” comedy and Michael Jackson/Jackson 5 music will embrace any of these characters with a breath of familiarity reserved when reminiscing on fond memories of friends or relatives. Prominent African-American actors whom you can identify with throughout your life. This cast had established icons and future legends, who would be cemented in black cult\nDoc 3(Title: \"How 40 years ago ‘The Wiz’ forever changed black culture ...\") By Gerrick D. Kennedy / Los Angeles Times Forty years after its original release, no film has uniquely defined black culture and shaped the framework of a musical genre quite like “The Wiz.”\nAn adaptation of the groundbreaking Broadway musical — itself a retelling of L. Frank Baum’s classic 1900 children’s fantasy “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” that became the beloved Judy Garland movie — the Sidney Lumet-directed film had a rapturous soundtrack produced by Quincy Jones, a cast that included Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne, Nipsey Russell, Mabel King and Richard Pryor and an aesthetic firmly rooted in black culture.\nFor a generation of black Americans, this was the first time they saw people who spoke, sung and moved the way they did in a Broadway production and, later, a big-screen musical, and it has become a kind of rite of passage for the black community.\nEveryone remembers their first time experiencing “The Wiz.” If it’s the stage production, that likely came from performing it in high school or seeing a touring troupe tackle it, but the film is the most accessible entry into the all-black retelling of “The Wizard of Oz.” Many of us recall watching it with family during the holidays, huddled around the TV singing the tunes.\nWhat was revolutionary about it, first in the original Broadway production and then amplified by Jones’ work on the splashy film version, was its songbook.\n“Grease” had arrived to big screens months earlier, as did “Thank God It’s Friday” (which, like “The Wiz,” was a Motown production), but both pulled from the world of disco and were tailored toward white audiences.\n“The Wiz,” however, weaved together gospel, blues, soul and R&B — genres that are unequivocally black creations — and were narratives of the black experience, an especially bold move given Hollywood’s monochromatic palette.\nIt bombed upon its release on Oct. 24, 1978 (it cost more than it earned, and critics dismissed it as a saccharine imitation of its stage predecessor), but that didn’t matter to audience members who were seeing themselves reflected on screen in ways they hadn’t before.\nHow it all started\nTo understand its power, let’s rewind to 1972. It was then that New York disc jockey Ken Harper, inspired by the dominance of the Motown sound, imagined a take of Baum’s epic fantasy that distilled the tale through a black lens.\nHe got the backing of Fox — in exchange for first option for film rights, publishing rights and album rights — and in 1974 “The Wiz: The Super Soul Musical ‘Wonderful Wizard of Oz’ ” opened in Baltimore, before hitting Broadway the following year.\n“The Wiz” weathered a ballooning budget, mixed reviews, technical hiccups, sluggish ticket sales and the constant threat of closure to become a sensation that earned seven Tony Awards, including best musical, and a multimillion-dollar adaptation from Motown and Universal, who grabbed the rights from Fox.\nBoth the stage and film productions of “The Wiz” have a common theme: the perseverance of the black American dream despite mighty odds. But where the original stage production uses Dorothy’s journey home from the Land of Oz to explore slavery, emancipation, the great migration and faith, the film updates it to a post-civil rights era.\nRural, turn-of-the-century Kansas in Baum’s version became contemporary Harlem. Now our heroine is an introverted Harlem schoolteacher that has never been south of 125th Street. Emerald City is a slick urban core brimming with temptations, and the Winkies are, in effect, the poor working class stuck under the thumb of a slave-driving tyrant.\n“The Wiz” is foremost a story of racial liberation, and an early piece of Afro-futurism — the combination of science fiction, fantasy, magic realism and ancient African tradition that critiques historical events or envisions a black future, inspiring such recent groundbreaking films as “Get Out” and “Black Panther” — but what has cemented its cult status is the music and movement seen onscreen.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Cultural - The Wiz - Sandwell College\") te to the stereotypes that plague our community.\nThe Wiz Live on NBC showed audiences all over, particularly small black children, there are people who look just like them and have a Broadway-caliber talent - yes, folks black people can do Broadway too.

I hope the changes aren't too drastic because The Wiz is a classic that is not dated and doesn't need to be fixed or improved.”\nBlack culture routinely shows its indefatigable disposition over the course of time towards overcoming obstacles. Entertainment is no different. This is why we revere our stars and the accomplishments of productions like 'The Wiz.' It declared to the entertainment world that black people will find the money and the outlets to tell these stories and perform. If the lanes are filled, they’ll create their own.\n“The Wiz set a trend that we see followed today.” Jermaine added, “Over the last 10 years, it seems like every year there's another reproduction of a classic staple of the \"Great White Way\" with an all black cast, or a black performer is given a lead role traditionally played by a white person : from Taye Diggs as Hedwig in Hedwig and the Angry Inch to Norm Lewis as The Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, from the all black versions of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to Annie starring Quvenzhané Wallis and Jamie Foxx. Many of these examples of non-traditional castings are walking through a door burst open by The Wiz.”\nAs we prepare to see a new spin on a classic tale, we are reminded that despite advances in diversity for entertainment and society, the core tenants of prejudice and limited opportunity permeate throughout Hollywood.

Here are the reasons why they did:\nOnly 3 percent of the women in Ohio, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming wanted to vote. “It is unwise, unfair, and unjust to force upon a majority of women, a measure which is obnoxious to all their ideals of womanhood, in order that the wishes of a small minority may prevail.” It seems it’s always the wicked, small minority that prevail. We can see this happening even in our culture.\n“All necessary and permanent moral and social reform must be rooted in the home life of the people. It is in the retirement of this quiet home life and not in the publicity of a noisy political campaign that true womanhood seeks an opportunity to serve the State.” It grieves me to see so many Christian women running for political office, especially those with a family. It should be men who are doing this. When women leave their posts, society crumbles as we are seeing today. No one can take the place of a woman in her home.\n“Women lack the physical ability to exercise the franchise on the same terms as men. Women are now exempt from jury service and liabilities to police service, including a call to arms in defense of the country. This exemption far more than compensates any gain which even the most ardent suffragists claim would result from conferring the right of suffrage upon women.” This was back when women understood that they were the weaker vessel, and they appreciated men being the stronger ones. The fight for women’s rights has made women’s life so much worse. Most women don’t want to be on jury service, policemen, or in the military. They understand that these are men’s roles. Women belong in their homes!\n“It is a mistake to presume that all women will vote right on moral issues. Experience proves that many of the worst ills of social life are due to the influence of women of low ideals of right and wrong, or of degraded morals. Women of this type would be a most dangerous element in political life and would lend themselves to the support of immoral issues, backed by designing demagogues in a manner which could not be counteracted by women of reputation and character.” We can see this clearly with abortion. The first seven books of Proverbs warns about evil women, and then there’s Jezebel. There’s also the verse about foolish women tearing their homes down. God did not create women to run society. He created men to do so. Yes, there are wicked men too, but that’s because we live in a fallen, wicked world, but it’s still God’s will for men to be the leaders.\n“To ever increasing courtesy of men as shown in the social relation of life as well as to their constant protection in business affairs, women owe a debt of gratitude. In view of this courtesy and protection, the demand for so-called ‘Women’s Rights’ is both unbecoming and ungenerous.” Men were appreciated back then. There was no competition with them. Women weren’t yelling “Toxic Masculinity!” No, they appreciated men’s contribution to society and to their welfare. They also valued the important role they had at home and raising the next generation.\nShe is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house.\nProverbs 7:11\nDoc 3(Title: \"Why did some women oppose the suffrage movement? | Special ...\") When most Americans consider the history and legacy of the women’s suffrage movement, they think of larger-than-life historical figures like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells, as well as momentous and impactful events like the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention. In other words, people understand the suffrage movement based on the contributions made by people who actively advocated for the expansion of voting rights to women and who believed that, as equals, women should be able to help shape the institutions and policies that shaped their own lives.\nOn the other hand, fewer Americans today may know much about the communities of women who did not believe that women should have the right to vote. Many today may not know that this group even existed in the first place. After all, why would women oppose the expansion of their own basic rights and privileges?\nTypically made up of women from more privileged social and economic backgrounds, the communities of women who opposed suffrage were called several different names, including “anti-suffragettes,” “antis” and “remonstrants.” One of the anti-suffrage groups who helped popularize the term “remonstrant” was the Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women.\nFounded in May 1895 in Boston, the organization’s first major undertaking was to facilitate an opposition campaign against the Wellman bill, a local initiative to give municipal suffrage rights to women in Boston. During the following years, the MAOFESW expanded its objectives to counter the growth of women’s suffrage advocacy across Massachusetts and other nearby states. Throughout the organization’s 25-year history, their work to prevent women’s suffrage revolved around the publication of original literature, as well as other methods of community engagement.\nThe MAOFESW created their own publications, including a journal called The Remonstrance, in order to advertise their views and goals and to facilitate wider engagement with local politicians and the general public. Published in February 1911, a pamphlet entitled “Some rights and exemptions given to women by Massachusetts law” illustrated a fundamental understanding shared by local anti-suffragists: that women already possessed ample social influence and power as compared to men and did not require or deserve the right to vote in elections. The pamphlet was outlined in a way to convince readers how women benefitted from current state laws and regulations even more than men, including in the domains of marriage, property ownership and citizenship.\nAlthough the MAOFESW consistently grew between the 1900s and 1910s–claiming 37,000 members across hundreds of communities in Massachusetts in 1915–the organization officially disbanded in 1920 after the ratification of the 19th Amendment. And while the MAOFESW and other similar “remonstrant” organizations across the country did lose their crusade against the expansion of voting rights to women, their campaigns remain important for fully understanding the evolution of the women’s suffrage movement and the forces that attempted to impede it.\nTo learn more about women’s suffrage, check out the “Get Out The Vote: Suffrage & Disenfranchisement in America” exhibit from the Special Collections and University Archives.\nDavid Biel, Candidate for Master of Library & Information Science, University of Maryland.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Opposition to Suffrage — History of U.S. Woman's Suffrage\") I do not believe that women are better than men. We have not wrecked railroads, nor corrupted legislature, nor done many unholy things that men have done; but then we must remember that we have not had the chance.\nJane Addams\nNational Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage\nOpposing votes for women may seem surprising today, but anti-suffrage views dominated among men and women through the early twentieth century. Suffragists had national organizations since 1869, but anti-suffragists did not found their own group until 1911.\nBefore organizing, suffrage opponents bonded without an official institution. Artists created political cartoons that mocked suffragists. Religious leaders spoke out against women’s political activism from the pulpit. Articles attacked women who took part in public life. Even without a coordinating institution, opposition to suffrage remained popular.\nIn the 1860s, opponents of woman suffrage began to organize locally. Massachusetts was home to leading suffrage advocates, and it was also one of the first states with an organized anti-suffrage group. In the 1880s, anti-suffrage activists joined together and eventually became known as the Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women.\nIn 1911, Josephine Dodge, who also led a movement to establish day care centers to help working mothers, founded the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NAOWS). The NAOWS was most popular in northeastern cities. Like pro-suffrage groups, NAOWS distributed publications and organized events and state campaigns.\nJust like men and women supported votes for women, men and women organized against suffrage as well. Anti-suffragists argued that most women did not want the vote. Because they took care of the home and children, they said women did not have time to vote or stay updated on politics. Some argued women lacked the expertise or mental capacity to offer a useful opinion about political issues. Others asserted that women’s votes would simply double the electorate; voting would cost more without adding any new value.\nBy Allison Lange, Ph.D.\nFall 2015\nEssential Questions\n- Where did formalized opposition to woman suffrage come from?\n- How was woman suffrage a threat to society and culture?\n- How was opposition expressed?\nDoc 5(Title: \"History of democracy - Wikipedia\") 1848, although in many instances forcefully put down, did result in democratic constitutions in some other European countries, among them the German states, Denmark and Netherlands.\n- 1850s: introduction of the secret ballot in Australia; 1872 in UK; 1892 in US\n- 1853: Black Africans given the vote for the first time in Southern Africa, in the British-administered Cape Province.\n- 1856: US – property ownership requirements were eliminated in all states, giving suffrage to most adult white males.

However, this practice was highly controversial in the 19th century; it was widely argued that no man would want to keep his vote secret unless he was ashamed of it.[citation needed]\nThe two earliest systems used were the Victorian method and the South Australian method. Both were introduced in 1856 to voters in Victoria and South Australia. The Victorian method involved voters crossing out all the candidates whom he did not approve of. The South Australian method, which is more similar to what most democracies use today, had voters put a mark in the preferred candidate's corresponding box. The Victorian voting system also was not completely secret, as it was traceable by a special number.\nWaves of democracy in the 20th century\n[edit]The end of the First World War was a temporary victory for democracy in Europe, as it was preserved in France and temporarily extended to Germany. Already in 1906 full modern democratic rights, universal suffrage for all citizens was implemented constitutionally in Finland as well as a proportional representation, open list system. Likewise, the February Revolution in Russia in 1917 inaugurated a few months of liberal democracy under Alexander Kerensky until Lenin took over in October. The terrible economic consequences of the Great Depression hurt democratic forces in many countries. The 1930s became a decade of dictators in Europe and Latin America.\nIn 1918 the United Kingdom granted the women over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote, a second one was later passed in 1928 granting women and men equal rights. On 18 August 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution was adopted which prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. French women got the right to vote in 1944, but did not actually cast their ballot for the first time until April 29, 1945.\nThe Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted full U.S. citizenship to America's indigenous peoples, called \"Indians\" in this Act. (The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to persons born in the U.S., but only if \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\"; this latter clause excludes certain indigenous peoples.) The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924. The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the documents provided, some women opposed women's suffrage because they believed women already had significant social influence and power, and didn't need the right to vote.

It established a quota system. This set a limit on how many immigrants from each country could enter the US every year. The Quota System made it so only 2% of a county's population could enter the US as immigrants each year. This mainly was to limit European immigration, and was successful in limiting immigration except from Mexico and Canada. During the 1920’s only about 38,000 Asian came into the United States.\nWhen the Immigrants got into America, most settled down and tried to find jobs. But employers wouldn’t give “aliens” jobs because they wanted true born Americans instead of “undesirable” immigrants.\nWhen the Immigrants got into America, most settled down and tried to find jobs. But employers wouldn’t give “aliens” jobs because they wanted true born Americans instead of “undesirable” immigrants.\nDoc 2(Title: \"The Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act)\") “Milestones in the History of U.S. Foreign Relations” has been retired and is no longer maintained. For more information, please see the full notice.\nThe Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act)\nIntroduction\nThe Immigration Act of 1924 limited the number of immigrants allowed entry into the United States through a national origins quota. The quota provided immigration visas to two percent of the total number of people of each nationality in the United States as of the 1890 national census. It completely excluded immigrants from Asia.\nLiteracy Tests and “Asiatic Barred Zone”\nIn 1917, the U.S. Congress enacted the first widely restrictive immigration law. The uncertainty generated over national security during World War I made it possible for Congress to pass this legislation, and it included several important provisions that paved the way for the 1924 Act. The 1917 Act implemented a literacy test that required immigrants over 16 years old to demonstrate basic reading comprehension in any language. It also increased the tax paid by new immigrants upon arrival and allowed immigration officials to exercise more discretion in making decisions over whom to exclude. Finally, the Act excluded from entry anyone born in a geographically defined “Asiatic Barred Zone” except for Japanese and Filipinos. In 1907, the Japanese Government had voluntarily limited Japanese immigration to the United States in the Gentlemen’s Agreement. The Philippines was a U.S. colony, so its citizens were U.S. nationals and could travel freely to the United States. China was not included in the Barred Zone, but the Chinese were already denied immigration visas under the Chinese Exclusion Act.\nImmigration Quotas\nThe literacy test alone was not enough to prevent most potential immigrants from entering, so members of Congress sought a new way to restrict immigration in the 1920s. Immigration expert and Republican Senator from Vermont William P. Dillingham introduced a measure to create immigration quotas, which he set at three percent of the total population of the foreign-born of each nationality in the United States as recorded in the 1910 census. This put the total number of visas available each year to new immigrants at 350,000. It did not, however, establish quotas of any kind for residents of the Western Hemisphere. President Wilson opposed the restrictive act, preferring a more liberal immigration policy, so he used the pocket veto to prevent its passage. In early 1921, the newly inaugurated President Warren Harding called Congress back to a special session to pass the law. In 1922, the act was renewed for another two years.\nWhen the congressional debate over immigration began in 1924, the quota system was so well-established that no one questioned whether to maintain it, but rather discussed how to adjust it. Though there were advocates for raising quotas and allowing more people to enter, the champions of restriction triumphed. They created a plan that lowered the existing quota from three to two percent of the foreign-born population. They also pushed back the year on which quota calculations were based from 1910 to 1890.\nAnother change to the quota altered the basis of the quota calculations. The quota had been based on the number of people born outside of the United States, or the number of immigrants in the United States. The new law traced the origins of the whole of the U.S. population, including natural-born citizens. The new quota calculations included large numbers of people of British descent whose families had long resided in the United States. As a result, the percentage of visas available to individuals from the British Isles and Western Europe increased, but newer immigration from other areas like Southern and Eastern Europe was limited.\nThe 1924 Immigration Act also included a provision excluding from entry any alien who by virtue of race or nationality was ineligible for citizenship.

As the commander-in-chief, the president has the ability to use wartime powers to enforce special laws. The Emancipation Proclamation was one of those laws that Lincoln had used his military powers to enforce.\nOriginally, Lincoln believed in the progressive elimination of slavery in all states. He believed that it was primarily up to the states to oversee the progressive abolition of slavery in their own individual power. Regardless of his political position on the matter, however, Lincoln had always believed that slavery was wrong. The Emancipation Proclamation served more as a military maneuver than a political maneuver. At the same time, this action cemented Lincoln as being a staunchly aggressive abolitionist and would ensure that slavery would eventually be removed from the entire United States.\nOne major political effect that the Emancipation Proclamation had was the fact that it invited slaves to serve in the Union Army. Such an action was a brilliant strategic choice. The decision to pass a law that told all slaves from the South that they were free and encouraging them to take up arms to join in the fight against their former masters was the brilliant tactical maneuver. Ultimately with those permissions, many freed slaves joined the Northern Army, drastically increasing their manpower. The North by the end of the war had over 200,000 African-Americans fighting for them.\nThe South was more or less in a state of turmoil after such an announcement. The proclamation had actually been publicized three times, the first time as a threat, the second time as a more formal announcement and then the third time as the signing of the Proclamation. When the Confederates heard the news, they were in a state of severe disrepair. One of them primary issues was that as the North advanced into territories and seized control of Southern land, they would often capture slaves. These slaves were simply restricted as contraband, not returned to their owners – the South.\nWhen the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, all current contraband, i.e. the slaves, were freed at the stroke of midnight. There was no offer of compensation, payment, or even a fair trade to the slave-owners. These slave-holders were suddenly deprived of what they believe to be property. Combined with the sudden loss of a large number of slaves, and influx of troops that would provide the North with additional firepower, the South found itself in a very tough position. Slaves were now able to escape from the South and as soon as they made it into the North, they would be free.\nYet as important as the Emancipation Proclamation was to America’s history, its actual impact on slavery was minimal at best. If nothing more, it was a way to solidify the president’s position as an abolitionist and to ensure the fact that slavery would be ended. Slavery wasn’t officially ended in the United States of America until the 13th Amendment was passed, in 1865.\nOne of the issues with the Emancipation Proclamation was that it was passed as a wartime measure. As stated before, in the United States, laws are not passed through the president, they are passed by Congress. This left the actual freedom status of the slaves up in the air. If the North were to win the war, the Emancipation Proclamation would not continue to be a constitutionally legal document. It would need to be ratified by the government in order to stay in effect.\nThe purpose of the Emancipation Proclamation has been muddled over the course of history. The basic line of though is that it freed the slaves. That is only partially correct, it merely freed the slaves in the South, something that wasn’t particularly enforceable due to the fact South was in a state of rebellion. What it did do however was ensure that if the North won, the South would be forced to free all of their slaves. Ultimately that would lead to the freedom of 3.1 million slaves.

This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are environment-friendly in order to gain the loyalty and respect of their customers.\n3) Changed technology\nTechnology is one of the most important factors which force change in the organization, and organizations are required to adapt to these changing technologies in order to keep up with the competition.\nFor example, in the past times, all works like record keeping, order placement, etc. were being done manually, but in the present time with the help of computers, there is no need to perform these works manually.\nSimilarly, in the production process, there were many tasks which workers were supposed to perform with hands, but at present, with automation, all of these works are performed using machines, and this has not only reduced the man-error but also sped up the production process.\nNow customers have a platform to reach to the organization, and companies can respond to the queries made by customers quickly because of the presence of advanced technology.\nTherefore, companies are required to stay focused and make changes in technology whenever they require to stay relevant in the market.\n4) Social changes\nSocial change is also a crucial factor which causes a change in an organization. Companies are required to change their production process with the changes in the needs and aspirations of people.\nDemands of people vary on the basis of the social environment and the status of people — factors like level of education, international influence, urbanization cause social changes.\nFor example, the demands of people living in an urban area will be different from the demands of people living in rural areas. People living in an urban area don’t much care about the price of the product, but they care about the quality and services provided by the organization.\nWhereas, on the other hand, people living in rural areas are more concerned about the price of the product and care less about the quality of the product and they usually choose products cheapest among all available alternatives.\n5) Failure\nFailure is a factor which puts an end on the operations of some organization as these organizations take with shame and stops from taking risks with innovation ideas.\nHowever, there are some organizations which rather than sitting back and thinking about bankruptcy has taken failure as a challenge and worked hard to change the failure into success by analyzing their weak operations and the operations which were not working well for them and changed them in order to proceed towards success.\nA common example that everyone is aware of is the success story of Apple company. Steve Jobs, the founder of the company, was driven out of the company because of his aggressive behavior, and the company started losing its business after Steve left the company.\nSteve was hired back by the company in 1997, and now we all know how his alliance with the Apple company has proved beneficial for it.\nAt present Apple is one of the largest companies in the world. Steve was not intimidated by the failure, but he has trust in his skills and vision. He took the company in his hands when it is at its lowest and take it to the peak of success.\nSimilarly, there are several examples of companies which took failure as a lesson and worked hard to become successful companies again.

He loved his job and was proud of all of his accomplishments. One day, on his way into work, he was greeted by a human resource manager. The manager took Robert aside and informed him that the company was having a corporate-wide layoff. Robert was laid off immediately and given a severance package. He was in total disbelief! Cheapo Toys' layoff was a huge change for the organization, and it occurred due to a number of factors.\nPlanned and unplanned are the two types of changes that can occur with an organization. Planned change occurs when deliberate decisions are made in an organization, while unplanned change is a result of unforeseen occurrences. Ironically, the layoff was a planned change for Cheapo Toys, but an unplanned change for Robert. External factors and internal factors can cause both of these types of changes within a company. Let's take a look at specific examples of each with Cheapo Toys as our backdrop.\nAn external force of change occurs from an outside influence on the organization. There are four main external forces of change:\n- Globalization\n- Workforce Diversity\n- Ethical Behavior\n- Technology\nCheapo Toys' original employees consisted of American employees who operated at two East Coast locations. Due to the globalization of the economy, the company was forced into many changes over the last 20 years. Cheapo Toys' competitors did not just consist of American companies but foreign as well. The kid population was declining in the U.S., so Cheapo Toys had to look elsewhere for sales. A big change for Cheapo Toys was building factories and selling overseas. The company now operates in over 10 different countries, ranging from France, London, Japan and India.\nA diverse workforce has also created a huge change for the company. When Cheapo Toys began years ago, most of their workforce consisted of men. Now, females are represented equally and all ethnicities exist within their various international locations.\nThe third external force of change is society's expectation of ethical behavior. Companies are now held to a higher standard of ethics. For example, companies have a social responsibility to ensure that their products do not damage the environment during the production process. Companies also have to conduct themselves ethically when it comes to their finances. Cheapo Toys has had to make huge changes in how they design, manufacture and sell their toys. All of their toys now have to be made with plastics made of safe chemicals for kids. In addition, the company has had to hire additional quality engineers to make sure that the products are designed for all of the changed safety standards.\nThe last external force that creates change in organizations is technology. Companies constantly have to change every aspect of their work life to ensure that they remain competitive. For example, Cheapo Toys just completed a three-day sales training session. All of their sales reps' laptops were traded for tablets. The tablets allow for easy presentations, traceability and sales order processing. Companies need to stay ahead of the technological curve or they will be left behind. Only 15 years ago, Cheapo Toys relied on just voicemail and emails for their sales reps' daily workload.\nThere are also numerous internal forces of change that companies must monitor.\nAn internal force of change occurs from internal sources, such as employees or company performance. These types include:\n- Poor Financial Performance\n- Internal Crisis (such as a strike)\n- Changes in Employee Expectations\nMost companies, at one time or another, are faced with poor financial performance. This, in turn, causes significant changes that need to be made in order to hel\nDoc 3(Title: \"Factors that Cause Change in an Organization.\") Factors that Cause Change in an Organization.\nRecently, I was in a Forum of Entrepreneurs to discuss about the collaborative efforts to bring in positive changes in small and medium industries (especially manufacturing / engineering), time and again we came across the issues –\n- competition,\n- sudden technological change - obsolete the existing processes/ practices,\n- uncompromising demands from clients in terms of quality, cost, timely delivery.\nThis has suddenly connected with me about the subject, what triggers CHANGE. In the world of cut throat competitive and volatile scenario, we need to understand the cause of Change, rather than rigid / close minded approach to sail successfully. Let‘s look into the “Why?” part of Change for our benefits:\n- Competition – to be successful, remain competitive is the key mantra by adopting the latest and innovative practices (Incl. technology-commerce – social aspects), suited to individual organizations.\n- Technology – Innovation & Technology will be the two key lifelines survival. Success positions with quick acclimatization of latest technology and its implementation. Procrastination in this matter may prove futile, which we have been seeing very often.\n- Compulsive demand from the Client / customer also pushes a supplier organization to change with respect to their processes, product / service lines. etc. to bring the deliverable to expected level. Three important aspects I wish to mention here is “Quality at Competitive Cost on Time”\n- Government Regulations- any changes in government regulations will have an impact on how an Organization does business / operate within guidelines.\nAbove all, Desire to Grow is another important factor triggers organization to constantly align with the latest innovations / change. The Organization / business that continue to survive and even thrive are usually the ones that most readily adapt to change.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Factors that Cause Change in Organizations: Planned and ...\") any performance. These types include:\n- Poor Financial Performance\n- Internal Crisis (such as a strike)\n- Changes in Employee Expectations\nMost companies, at one time or another, are faced with poor financial performance. This, in turn, causes significant changes that need to be made in order to help the company. Changes can consist of selling products, moving locations, hiring new management or even laying off employees. Cheapo Toys relies on producing the hot toy for the holiday season. If their toys are not popular with the kids, then drastic changes usually have to occur to save finances. Last year, for example, Cheapo Toys moved their headquarters from New York to Ashville, North Carolina, to save money. Many of the employees did not make the move and had to find work elsewhere.\nSometimes internal crises occur within the company that are unforeseen. For example, Cheapo's factory workers went on strike a few months ago to protest an expired contract and to request higher wages. This crisis caused a huge drop in toy production, which resulted in Cheapo having to sell their stuffed toy division for additional money to stay afloat during the strike.\nChanges in employee expectations is the third internal force of change. Employees today want flexible work time, the ability to work from home and excellent working conditions. This change in expectations has led many companies to offer an all-in-one corporate office to keep employees happy on site. Companies have free gyms, doctor's offices and even daycare available on site.\nPlanned and unplanned are the two types of changes that can occur with an organization. Planned changes occur when deliberate decisions are made in an organization, while unplanned change is a result of unforeseen occurrences. External factors and internal factors can cause both of these types of changes within a company. External forces of change are globalization, workforce diversity, ethical behavior and technology. Internal forces of change consist of poor financial performance, internal crises or a change in worker expectations.\nChanges in Organizations: Thought Exercises\nResearch Projects\n1.

Change happens in every organization, and every organization is required to adapt to that change to maintain its position in the market. There are various factors which cause a change in the organization.\nEffective business management requires to have an awareness of the factors which can cause a change in the organization. Knowing the factors which cause change helps a manager to take decisions accordingly, which helps the organization grow and reduces the chances of loss.\nIn this article, you will learn about the different factors which cause changes in an organization.\nTable of Contents\nFactors that cause a change in an organization\n1) Change in governmental policies\nNo matter whether your organization is a public organization or a private organization government has control on it; however, the percentage of control varies.\nHave you ever wondered how specific businesses have thrived amidst constant organizational change?\nQuick Statistics: According to a study by McKinsey & Company, over 70% of change management efforts within organizations fail. However, companies that engage in active communication and employee involvement during change processes have 30% higher success rates in implementing changes efficiently. This highlights the critical importance of open communication in successful organizational transformations. (Source: McKinsey & Company, 2023)\nBrief Case Studies: A notable example is Netflix, which successfully transformed its business model from DVD rentals to a leading streaming service. By continuously innovating and diving into content creation, Netflix increased its subscriber base from 23 million in 2011 to over 200 million in 2023. This shift not only improved customer engagement but also allowed Netflix to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing digital environment. (Source: Netflix Earnings Reports)\nGovernment policies decide the way an organization operates and what it can produce and not. For example, recently in India government has banned the use of certain types of plastic and because of this policy.\nThe operations of many organizations have changed as they are needed to make changes in the plastic. Similarly, there are various policies like employment hire policy, wages policy, and rights of employees and workers are controlled by the organization and the organizations are required to abide by these policies to be able to operate freely.\nFor example, in India, there is a policy that a minimum of 30% of the total employees of an organization should be women. This forces organizations to hire woman employees.\n2) Change in market demand\nAnother important factor which causes a change in an organization is the changing demand of the market. Gone are the days when people are required to accustom themselves because of the products provided by the companies because, at that time, they did not have many options to choose from.\nIn modern times, there are several options available for one product in the market, and people have the freedom to choose from any of the product, and they have become less loyal for brands. They buy products from an organization which provides them a good quality of products at the lowest prices.\nBecause of this reason, companies are required to stay on their toes and change fast in order to facilitate the changing requirements of their customers.\nFor examples, in the era of the internet, people prefer to shop online rather than shopping from a physical store. Therefore, organizations are required to take their businesses online so that they can fulfill the changing demand of their customers.\nHere is another example of a change in the market demand is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that the factors causing dance styles to change over time are not directly addressed.

He loved his job and was proud of all of his accomplishments. One day, on his way into work, he was greeted by a human resource manager. The manager took Robert aside and informed him that the company was having a corporate-wide layoff. Robert was laid off immediately and given a severance package. He was in total disbelief! Cheapo Toys' layoff was a huge change for the organization, and it occurred due to a number of factors.\nPlanned and unplanned are the two types of changes that can occur with an organization. Planned change occurs when deliberate decisions are made in an organization, while unplanned change is a result of unforeseen occurrences. Ironically, the layoff was a planned change for Cheapo Toys, but an unplanned change for Robert. External factors and internal factors can cause both of these types of changes within a company. Let's take a look at specific examples of each with Cheapo Toys as our backdrop.\nAn external force of change occurs from an outside influence on the organization. There are four main external forces of change:\n- Globalization\n- Workforce Diversity\n- Ethical Behavior\n- Technology\nCheapo Toys' original employees consisted of American employees who operated at two East Coast locations. Due to the globalization of the economy, the company was forced into many changes over the last 20 years. Cheapo Toys' competitors did not just consist of American companies but foreign as well. The kid population was declining in the U.S., so Cheapo Toys had to look elsewhere for sales. A big change for Cheapo Toys was building factories and selling overseas. The company now operates in over 10 different countries, ranging from France, London, Japan and India.\nA diverse workforce has also created a huge change for the company. When Cheapo Toys began years ago, most of their workforce consisted of men. Now, females are represented equally and all ethnicities exist within their various international locations.\nThe third external force of change is society's expectation of ethical behavior. Companies are now held to a higher standard of ethics. For example, companies have a social responsibility to ensure that their products do not damage the environment during the production process. Companies also have to conduct themselves ethically when it comes to their finances. Cheapo Toys has had to make huge changes in how they design, manufacture and sell their toys. All of their toys now have to be made with plastics made of safe chemicals for kids. In addition, the company has had to hire additional quality engineers to make sure that the products are designed for all of the changed safety standards.\nThe last external force that creates change in organizations is technology. Companies constantly have to change every aspect of their work life to ensure that they remain competitive. For example, Cheapo Toys just completed a three-day sales training session. All of their sales reps' laptops were traded for tablets. The tablets allow for easy presentations, traceability and sales order processing. Companies need to stay ahead of the technological curve or they will be left behind. Only 15 years ago, Cheapo Toys relied on just voicemail and emails for their sales reps' daily workload.\nThere are also numerous internal forces of change that companies must monitor.\nAn internal force of change occurs from internal sources, such as employees or company performance. These types include:\n- Poor Financial Performance\n- Internal Crisis (such as a strike)\n- Changes in Employee Expectations\nMost companies, at one time or another, are faced with poor financial performance. This, in turn, causes significant changes that need to be made in order to hel\nDoc 3(Title: \"What Causes Change in an Organization? 10 Factors Explored\") nd is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are environment-friendly in order to gain the loyalty and respect of their customers.\n3) Changed technology\nTechnology is one of the most important factors which force change in the organization, and organizations are required to adapt to these changing technologies in order to keep up with the competition.\nFor example, in the past times, all works like record keeping, order placement, etc. were being done manually, but in the present time with the help of computers, there is no need to perform these works manually.\nSimilarly, in the production process, there were many tasks which workers were supposed to perform with hands, but at present, with automation, all of these works are performed using machines, and this has not only reduced the man-error but also sped up the production process.\nNow customers have a platform to reach to the organization, and companies can respond to the queries made by customers quickly because of the presence of advanced technology.\nTherefore, companies are required to stay focused and make changes in technology whenever they require to stay relevant in the market.\n4) Social changes\nSocial change is also a crucial factor which causes a change in an organization. Companies are required to change their production process with the changes in the needs and aspirations of people.\nDemands of people vary on the basis of the social environment and the status of people — factors like level of education, international influence, urbanization cause social changes.\nFor example, the demands of people living in an urban area will be different from the demands of people living in rural areas. People living in an urban area don’t much care about the price of the product, but they care about the quality and services provided by the organization.\nWhereas, on the other hand, people living in rural areas are more concerned about the price of the product and care less about the quality of the product and they usually choose products cheapest among all available alternatives.\n5) Failure\nFailure is a factor which puts an end on the operations of some organization as these organizations take with shame and stops from taking risks with innovation ideas.\nHowever, there are some organizations which rather than sitting back and thinking about bankruptcy has taken failure as a challenge and worked hard to change the failure into success by analyzing their weak operations and the operations which were not working well for them and changed them in order to proceed towards success.\nA common example that everyone is aware of is the success story of Apple company. Steve Jobs, the founder of the company, was driven out of the company because of his aggressive behavior, and the company started losing its business after Steve left the company.\nSteve was hired back by the company in 1997, and now we all know how his alliance with the Apple company has proved beneficial for it.\nAt present Apple is one of the largest companies in the world. Steve was not intimidated by the failure, but he has trust in his skills and vision. He took the company in his hands when it is at its lowest and take it to the peak of success.\nSimilarly, there are several examples of companies which took failure as a lesson and worked hard to become successful companies again. However, sailing through tough times is not a cup of tea of every organization, emerging from failure requires strength, vision, and a tremendous amount of hard work.\n6) Competitive innovation\nCompetitive innovation forces companies to change. When a competitive company innovate something or do something which can be dangerous for your product then to meet the competition you need to make changes in you\nDoc 4(Title: \"Factors that Cause Change in Organizations: Planned and ...\") any performance.

Here's What ...\") 03. Other examples include erasing people of color from times and places where they would be—namely, the streets of 1920s New York in the 2016 film \"Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.\" Why Is Whitewashing Harmful? In a practical sense, whitewashing takes work away from actors of color, said Nishime. \"Beyond that, there are so few representations of people of color in media. Losing even one more hurts us. It also silences us, so we don't get to tell our own stories,\" added Nishime. On a personal level, whitewashing can have a substantial mental impact. \"Unfortunately, it lingers on due to stereotypes, media, and familial influence,\" Leela Magavi, MD, a psychiatrist based in California, told Health. \"It can lead to debilitating anxiety as minority individuals may feel pressured to look, speak, or present a certain way.\" Dr. Magavi recalled evaluating adolescents and adults who reported feeling pressured to soften their tone or change their voice to fit in. \"Whitewashing can cause demoralization, exacerbate feelings of imposter syndrome, and worsen low mood and anxiety symptoms,\" said Dr. Magavi. How Discrimination Can Affect Mental Health Many people who experience the effects of whitewashing will likely never see a psychiatrist or therapist because of it. Still, whitewashing is part of a larger discrimination pattern, which can significantly affect mental and physical health. In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared racism a public health threat due to its profound impact on mental and physical health. A report published in 2016 found that people who face discrimination have higher stress and worse overall health than others. Stress increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, depression or anxiety, and menstrual problems. According to the 2016 report, among those who did not report discrimination: 45% overall reported excellent or very good health46% of White people reported excellent or very good health37% of Hispanic people reported excellent or very good health32% of Black people reported excellent or very good health In contrast, the researchers found that for those who reported discrimination: 31% overall reported excellent or very good health34% percent of White people (such as those in the LGBTQ+ community) reported excellent or very good health29% of Hispanic people reported excellent or very good health28% of Black people reported excellent or very good health How To Prevent Whitewashing People of color protesting against whitewashing in entertainment media, news media, politics, and history must be heard, said Nishime. \"We also need to support more independent media makers. They are the ones who are making stories that center Asian Americans and other people of color,\" added Nishime. People can make a difference by being empathetic toward the cause. Empathy creates a space for open communication, which helps people struggling with whitewashing and other forms of racism feel safe and supported. \"Empathy allows us to dismantle the multifaceted detriments of racism,\" explained Dr. Magavi. \"Listening to individuals with disparate cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds speak about their life experiences allows us to become better, more compassionate individuals.\" Read more: Wellness Mental Health Social and Public Health Was this page helpful?

In media, whitewashing is when White actors portray non-White characters. Historically, White actors have portrayed Black and Asian people, as well as classical and mythological characters. For example, in the 2022 film \"Bullet Train,\" Brad Pitt and Joey King played Japanese characters from the original book by Kōtarō Isaka, despite neither actor being of Japanese descent. Whitewashing is a form of racial discrimination that may lead to poor mental health outcomes. Whitewashing leads to a lack of representation of non-White communities in pop culture. As a result, non-White actors do not have the same space to tell their stories as White actors. Getty / Design by Jo Imperio What Is Whitewashing? In its narrowest definition, whitewashing in film and television is the eliminating or replacing people of color with White actors, LeiLani Nishime, PhD, a professor of communication at the University of Washington and author of \"Undercover Asian,\" told Health. Whitewashing includes a preference for White actors and other roles, such as directors and producers, over people of color with equal qualifications. Likewise, non-White actors not receiving representation in award nominations, like the Academy Awards, is a form of whitewashing. One of the most classic examples of whitewashing comes from the 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" in which White actor Mickey Rooney portrays Mr. Yunioshi, an Asian man. In the role, Rooney plays a stereotype of an Asian man while wearing yellowface. People in media have used practices like blackface, brownface, and yellowface—in which White actors wear makeup to change their skin color—largely to depict offensive caricatures of non-White characters. Whitewashing has continued to be prevalent in pop culture. In 2021, television and film producer Kevin Feige, a primary producer of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, admitted it was wrong to cast White actor Tilda Swinton in the 2016 movie, \"Doctor Strange,\" in an interview with Men's Health. The original Marvel comic book character, \"The Ancient One,\" is an Asian man. \"Doctor Strange\" is only one example of many instances of whitewashing in the media. In the 2015 film \"Aloha,\" Emma Stone plays an Air Force pilot named Allison Ng. Although the character has Chinese and Hawaiian ancestry, Stone does not. Displacement as Whitewashing Another type of whitewashing is displacing people of color in a story to put the focus on White characters, said Nishime. For example, the 2015 movie \"Stonewall\" tells the story of the 1969 Stonewall riots. The movie centers around a cis, White gay man. In actuality, Black and Latinx trans women, such as Sylvia Rivera and Miss Major, led the Stonewall riots. Whitewashing may even involve creating fantasy worlds in which people of color do not exist. A prime example is \"The Lord of The Rings\" film trilogy, released from 2001 to 2003. Other examples include erasing people of color from times and places where they would be—namely, the streets of 1920s New York in the 2016 film \"Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.\" Why Is Whitewashing Harmful? In a practical sense, whitewashing takes work away from actors of color, said Ni\nDoc 4(Title: \"Often asked: Why Did Some Women's Rights Leaders Opposed ...\") In today's fast-paced business environment, companies need reliable and efficient IT hardware to support their operations.

Of course, it’s nothing new for a nation with a long history of extreme racist violence—the most recent lynching-related death occurred in 1981, hardly a lifetime ago, when Michael Donald was hanged by two members of the Ku Klux Klan.The United States, however, continues to avoid its history on race, refusing to confront its past in a “post-racial,” “colorblind” society, and that policy of systemic ignorance is particularly strong when mention of racial equality is brought up. Although the concept of equality has never truly existed in this world, as can be traced back to the very beginnings of recorded history we see the nobles ruling the commoners, conquerors reigning over the conquered, the will of man dominating women; the United States needs to acknowledge the fact that racial inequality still exists within our country and has in no way progressed towards betterment.\nIs the society’s draconian attendance towards the people of distinguishable race a fair measure of precaution or an act of discrimination? In the society we live in today, the enactment of racial bias has made a monumental impact, shaping many individuals ' lives by default. However, is it fair for the innocent individuals to be shrouded with the burden of being a particular ‘race’? After witnessing, the incident of Ferguson, I became dreadfully discontented to discovered that people today have self-established the immense belief that people of color are the primary cause of danger, and therefore, they must be regarded as hazardous creatures. Moreover, the reason triggering the detrimental policing was due to the color of the victims, illustrating the ugly truth of racial profiling still remains intact to our society. Although racial profiling and prejudice are disavowed publicly by Americans, many statistics and research on implicit racial bias debated the citizens of the United States still perceive a person 's physical in determining their likeliness to committee crime (Bornstein, Avram). Unfortunately, it is ingrained in today’s society that institutional structures demonstrate persistent inequality and unequal distribution of societal resources (White, Rob).\nIn this day in age Racial stereotypes appear to be as rampant as they were in the early 200s. The discussion and debate about race can be a sensitive and difficult subject for most individuals. Living in America is tough as it is with all of the crisis’s and chaos taking place left and right. That matter of race is a crisis of its own so to speak.

The United States as a migrant country, immigration culture, complex skin color, ethnic racial relations are complex. The race of society has been going on for more than half a century. Racism is a self centered attitude, and racial differences determine the history of human society and cultural development. Racial discrimination has always been a serious social problem.

This report uses SSA data from 2013 and compares these with data collected from earlier surveys (the Well? Survey series) to examine whether attitudes to mental health in Scotland have changed over time.\nMain Findings\n- Overall, attitudes towards mental health and those with mental health problems have been fairly stable over the last decade. No clear trends towards either an overall reduction or increase in stigmatising attitudes have been detected, although there have been a few notable changes in responses to individual questions.\n- Around two-thirds of people said they knew someone who had experienced a mental health problem (65%), a similar proportion to 2006 and 2008. However, more people in 2013 knew someone with depression, dementia or an anxiety disorder than in 2008.\n- A quarter of people (26%) said they had personally experienced a mental health problem, a similar level to that in each of the previous surveys. The most common mental health problem people had experienced was depression (21%).\n- Eighty-five percent of those with a mental health problem had told someone about it. People were most likely to have told family and friends (more than 4 out of 5) with much smaller numbers having told their manager or boss (around 1 in 5) or a colleague (around 1 in 6).\n- Over one-third of people (37%) with mental health problems said they had experienced some negative social impact as a result of others' attitudes towards their problem. This was an increase from 2008 (23%) and a return to the level reported in 2004 (36%).\n- When asked whether they had personally decided to avoid a social event because of the way they thought people would treat them, a substantially larger proportion (22%) said they had done so.\n- In 2013 the five factors that supported an individual's recovery which were chosen most often (by those with personal experience of a mental health problem) were: medication (42%); 'support from family or friends' (41%); 'other forms of treatment/therapy' (27%); 'developing my own coping strategies' (26%); and 'finding out more about mental health' (19%).\n- There have been quite substantial changes since 2008 in the factors identified as supporting an individual's recovery. In particular, there was a sharp decline in the proportion choosing 'family or friends' (from 62% in 2008 to 41% in 2013) and 'having belief in myself' (from 31% in 2008 to 15% in 2013). By contrast there was a substantial increase since 2008 in the proportion selecting 'other forms of treatment/therapy' (from 19% in 2008 to 27% in 2013) and 'finding out more about mental health' (from 8% in 2008, to 19% in 2013).\n- In 2013, two-thirds of people with mental health problems (65%) received either a completely or mainly positive message from professionals. This is lower than recorded in 2008 (73%) but similar to that recorded in 2006 (66%). The proportion receiving a positive message from family and/or friends declined from 79%, in 2008, to 66% in 2013.\n- Almost half (47%) said that if they were suffering from mental health problems they 'wouldn't want people knowing about it'. Around one in six (17%) said they 'would find it hard to talk to someone with mental health problems'.\n- Around 1 in 5 agreed with the statement that 'people with mental health problems are often dangerous' and more than 1 in 4 that 'the public should be better protected from people with mental health problems'.

This report focuses on one particular group of citizens - those with mental health problems[2] - and explores public attitudes to those experiencing mental health problems. This is a large group, with approximately one in four people experiencing some kind of mental health problem in any given year according to recent estimates[3].\n1.2 The report presents findings from the 2013 Scottish Social Attitudes survey (SSA) and provides a detailed picture of public attitudes towards mental health problems in 2013. The report examines the extent to which individuals with mental health problems are able to live free from stigma, discrimination, injustice and inequality, and also explores attitudes to recovery among those who identified themselves as having or having had a mental health problem. Moreover, as this is the fifth time that the questions have been asked during the period 2002-2013 (see Paras 1.21-1.23 below) this report also provides valuable insight into whether - and if so how - public attitudes in this area are changing over time.\n1.3 This introductory chapter outlines the rationale, context and aims of the survey, discusses why attitudes to mental health problems are of critical importance, outlines the previous research which has been undertaken, and summarises the report structure and conventions.\nResearch questions\n1.4 This report presents findings on three key questions:\n- How have attitudes to people with mental health problems changed over time?\n- What factors are related to people's attitudes towards people with mental health problems?\n- For those with direct experience of mental health problems, what have the social impacts been, what has helped or hindered their recovery, and have they received positive messages about their recovery?\nPolicy context\n1.5 The mental health and wellbeing of populations has become an increasing global priority since the recommendations of the first major report on this topic (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2001) were adopted by the World Health Assembly of the WHO in 2002. From this time, there has been a focus on the importance of adopting policies and practices which would reduce stigma and discrimination, and aid recovery[4]. Indeed, the 2001 WHO report gave renewed emphasis to UN principles set out a decade earlier on the protection of persons with mental health problems and the improvement of mental health care which asserted that there should be 'no discrimination on the grounds of mental illness'[5].\n1.6 In Scotland post-devolution, the focus on improving mental health and mental wellbeing was initially addressed through the National Programme for Improving Mental Wellbeing (hereafter referred to as 'the National Programme') which was launched in October 2001 and ran until 2008. The National Programme formed part of the then Scottish Executive's wider policy on improving health and reducing inequalities. It articulated a vision 'to improve the mental health and wellbeing of everyone living in Scotland and to improve the quality of life and social inclusion of people who experience mental health problems'.\n1.7 Through its lifetime the National Programme focused on raising awareness and promoting mental health and wellbeing; eliminating discrimination; preventing suicide; and promoting and supporting recovery. The legislative context for the National Programme was informed by the Human Rights Act (1998), which sets out the basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled, an\nDoc 3(Title: \"1 Introduction - Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland ...\") be interested in stigmatising attitudes as well as in discriminatory behaviours. First and foremost, attitudes often underpin behaviours. If the public believe that people with mental health problems should not be entitled to share the same rights and resources as others, then they are more likely to express this view through action that excludes individuals from that group. Second, even where people's attitudes do not translate into specific discriminatory behaviour, it might be argued that reducing the prevalence of stigmatising attitudes is an important part of building good relations between all sections of society. The importance of challenging stigmatising attitudes more generally (and not just in relation to those people with mental health problems) has been increasingly recognised, for example, in the 'One Scotland, many cultures' campaign[15].\n1.19 Note that it is perfectly possible for discriminatory actions to occur in the absence of such attitudes - for example as a result of bias in institutional procedures or practice. As such, where the report states that stigmatising attitudes appear to be uncommon, this does not imply that discrimination itself is uncommon or that people with mental health problems are not likely to experience this.\nPrevious research\n1.20 The first National Scottish Survey of Public Attitudes to Mental Health, Mental Wellbeing and Mental Health Problems (the Well? What do you think? survey) was commissioned in 2002 to provide baseline data in relation to the National Programme. Further rounds of the Well? What do you think? survey series (referred to in what follows as the Well? survey(s)) were commissioned in 2004, 2006, and 2008, and these were used to track progress and help influence the work of the National Programme in relation to specific outcomes and objectives[16]. The objectives of the research were to:\n- Investigate people's perceptions of their own general health and lifestyle\n- Explore people's understanding of mental wellbeing and mental health problems, and their understanding of the factors affecting these\n- Investigate people's direct experience of mental health problems and recovery from mental health problems\n- Explore people's attitudes to mental health problems, including stereotypes and myths\n- Explore people's attitudes to those who experience specific symptoms of mental health problems.\n1.21 In relation to 2013, it was agreed to repeat a reduced set of questions which would focus mainly on attitudes, and which would not cover people's knowledge and personal wellbeing in great detail. It was also agreed that rather than conducting a separate survey focusing on mental health alone, the questions should be administered as a module on SSA. Questions about people's perceptions of their own health and lifestyle, their understanding of factors affecting mental health, and their sources of information on mental health problems were therefore omitted. The remaining questions concentrated on attitudes towards mental health problems, including stereotypes and myths; attitudes to those who experience specific mental health conditions; and people's direct experience of mental health problems and recovery.\n1.22 Given that many of the questions included in SSA 2013 were also asked in the four Well? surveys, it is possible in principle to examine change over time. However, we comment below (see Para 1.25) on methodological issues which might impact on the comparisons.\nReport structure\n1.23 The remainder of the report is structured as follows:\n- Chapter two discusses people's own personal experience of mental health problems and indirect experience through knowing family or friends who have had a mental health problem; whether or not people tell others about their mental health problems; and the social impact of having a mental health problem\n- Chapter three looks at attitudes to recovery and the nature of the messages people with mental health problems receive about recovery from profe\nDoc 4(Title: \"1 Introduction - Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland ...\") ad a mental health problem; whether or not people tell others about their mental health problems; and the social impact of having a mental health problem\n- Chapter three looks at attitudes to recovery and the nature of the messages people with mental health problems receive about recovery from professionals, and from family and/or friends\n- Chapter four summarises the findings on general perceptions of people with mental health problems, including myths and stereotypes\n- Chapter five focuses on attitudes to those who experience specific mental health problems\n- Chapter six summarises the main findings and conclusions.\nAbout the data\n1.24 The Scottish Social Attitudes survey was established by ScotCen Social Research, an independent organisation based in Edinburgh and part of NatCen Social Research, the UK's largest independent social research agency. The survey provides robust data on changing social and political attitudes to inform both public policy and academic study. Around 1,500 face-to-face interviews are conducted annually (1,497 in 2013) with a representative probability sample of the Scottish population. Interviews are conducted in respondents' homes, using computer assisted personal interviewing. Most of the interview is conducted face-to-face by a ScotCen interviewer, but some questions each year are asked in a self-completion section. The survey has achieved a response rate of between 54% and 65% in each year since 1999 (in 2013, the response rate was 55%). The data are weighted to correct for over-sampling, non-response bias and to ensure they reflect the sex-age profile of the Scottish population. All sample sizes shown below the charts and tables show unweighted bases. Further technical details about the survey are included in Annex B.\n1.25 Methodological changes were implemented between the Well? survey series and SSA 2013. There were changes to the method of data collection for questions asked of those who had experienced mental health problems (face-to-face in the Well? survey series and self-complete in SSA 2013). There were also some alterations to question wording and question ordering[17]. While these methodological differences are unlikely to affect the substantive conclusions, they do mean that some caution is required in interpreting trends.\nLimitations of the data\n1.26 The Scottish Social Attitudes survey is a quantitative survey which focuses on producing robust and reliable population estimates across a wide range of substantive topics. In common with other general population surveys, individuals living in specific settings where the incidence of mental health problems is known to be high (e.g. prisons, hospitals, residential care facilities) are not included in the sample. The survey does not allow questions about respondents' motivations or feelings to be examined in depth; this would require more detailed research using qualitative methods.\n1.27 Questions for the SSA survey are developed through a rigorous and detailed process involving cognitive testing and extensive piloting. There is also discussion on a question-by-question basis of whether the most suitable approach is to use face-to-face or self-complete methods. This ensures that as far as possible questions will be interpreted in a uniform fashion, and that any social desirability bias - especially in relation to sensitive questions - will be minimised. However, it is acknowledged that variation in how questions are interpreted by respondents and the possibility of social desirability bias in such a complex area as mental health cannot be completely eliminated.\nAnalysis and reporting conventions\n1.28 All percentages cited in this report are based on the weighted data (see Annex B for details) and are rounded to the nearest whole number. All differences described in the text (between years, or between different groups of people) are statistically significant at the 95% level or above, unless otherwise specified. This means that the probab\nDoc 5(Title: \"Changing Attitudes Towards People With Mental Health ...\") Changing Attitudes Towards People With Mental Health Issues Social Work Essay\nMental health problems are common and widely misunderstood; they are an integral part of public health and can affect all of us. The World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that: “The single most important barrier to overcome in the community is the stigma and associated discrimination towards persons suffering from mental and behavioural disorders” (WHO, 2001, p. 98). Mental health problems are still surrounded by prejudice, fear and ignorance, despite the fact that one in four adults has experienced them. Individuals who suffer from mental health problems often are discriminated against and have to deal with other people’s stigma; these concerns have led to national campaigns. In this essay I will attempt to discuss the concepts surrounding discrimination and stigma in relation to mental ill health and also discuss a current campaign, “See Me”, which is Scotland’s national campaign aimed at putting an end to the negative attitudes and behaviours affecting those who have mental health issues.\nIn 2002 a Scottish campaign called “See Me” was launched, and was aimed to tackle the issues surrounding mental health problems, and to put an end to the discrimination against mentally ill individuals. Financed by the Scottish government, “See Me” is co-ordinated by five mental health organizations: Highland User Group, Penumbra, and the Royal College of psychiatrics – Scottish division, the Scottish Association for Mental Health Support and in Mind.\nIn recent years, research has indicated a widespread social stigmatising attitude directed at individuals who suffer from mental health problems (Byrne, 1997, 2001). This has attracted increased attention amongst the general public, health professionals and the press. Stigma has been described by Goffman as “a situation of the individual who is disqualified from full social acceptance” (Goffman, 1963, p. 9). It refers to the negative attitudes and behaviour directed at individuals who suffer from mental health problems.\nStigma can be a variety of issues ranging from being ignored, to being bullied and physically abused. These stigmatizing attitudes as founded upon the belief that someone is not normal, or of lesser value, and can lead to discrimination. Discrimination stems from the lack of knowledge towards mental ill health. To “discriminate” means to apply special treatment, generally unfavourable, to an individual because of their gender, race, age, religious beliefs, or disability. Discrimination can be direct or indirect, positive or negative and in the negative from is unlawful. According to Corrigan and Miller (2003), discrimination is “a direct result of negative attitudes and behaviours towards a group of people.” In 1995, the Disability Discrimination Act ruled that discrimination of individuals based on their disability would be illegal. This applied to workplaces, schools, transport and the provision of goods or services.\nMental Health is a major focus of concern and interest in contemporary society, The world health organisation qualifies mental health as: “a state of well being in which every individual realises his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.” NHS Scotland suggests that: positive mental health is about feeling in control, being in touch with our feelings, being able to make rational decisions and feeling good about ourselves, there are many barriers which can effect positive mental health, such as the social world, emotional resilience and structural factors, in order to achieve positive mental health we have to overcome these structural barriers and to do this we need the use of health promotion. Health promotion has been described as ‘the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. It moves beyond a focus on individual behaviou\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems changes in attitudes and lifestyle can involve reducing stigma and discrimination towards those with mental health problems in Scotland.

This is a large group, with approximately one in four people experiencing some kind of mental health problem in any given year according to recent estimates[3].\n1.2 The report presents findings from the 2013 Scottish Social Attitudes survey (SSA) and provides a detailed picture of public attitudes towards mental health problems in 2013. The report examines the extent to which individuals with mental health problems are able to live free from stigma, discrimination, injustice and inequality, and also explores attitudes to recovery among those who identified themselves as having or having had a mental health problem. Moreover, as this is the fifth time that the questions have been asked during the period 2002-2013 (see Paras 1.21-1.23 below) this report also provides valuable insight into whether - and if so how - public attitudes in this area are changing over time.\n1.3 This introductory chapter outlines the rationale, context and aims of the survey, discusses why attitudes to mental health problems are of critical importance, outlines the previous research which has been undertaken, and summarises the report structure and conventions.\nResearch questions\n1.4 This report presents findings on three key questions:\n- How have attitudes to people with mental health problems changed over time?\n- What factors are related to people's attitudes towards people with mental health problems?\n- For those with direct experience of mental health problems, what have the social impacts been, what has helped or hindered their recovery, and have they received positive messages about their recovery?\nPolicy context\n1.5 The mental health and wellbeing of populations has become an increasing global priority since the recommendations of the first major report on this topic (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2001) were adopted by the World Health Assembly of the WHO in 2002. From this time, there has been a focus on the importance of adopting policies and practices which would reduce stigma and discrimination, and aid recovery[4]. Indeed, the 2001 WHO report gave renewed emphasis to UN principles set out a decade earlier on the protection of persons with mental health problems and the improvement of mental health care which asserted that there should be 'no discrimination on the grounds of mental illness'[5].\n1.6 In Scotland post-devolution, the focus on improving mental health and mental wellbeing was initially addressed through the National Programme for Improving Mental Wellbeing (hereafter referred to as 'the National Programme') which was launched in October 2001 and ran until 2008. The National Programme formed part of the then Scottish Executive's wider policy on improving health and reducing inequalities. It articulated a vision 'to improve the mental health and wellbeing of everyone living in Scotland and to improve the quality of life and social inclusion of people who experience mental health problems'.\n1.7 Through its lifetime the National Programme focused on raising awareness and promoting mental health and wellbeing; eliminating discrimination; preventing suicide; and promoting and supporting recovery. The legislative context for the National Programme was informed by the Human Rights Act (1998), which sets out the basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled, an\nDoc 4(Title: \"1 Introduction - Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland ...\") moting mental health and wellbeing; eliminating discrimination; preventing suicide; and promoting and supporting recovery. The legislative context for the National Programme was informed by the Human Rights Act (1998), which sets out the basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled, and the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, which was designed to ensure that free and informed consent forms the basis of treatment for people experiencing mental health problems. A range of initiatives (see Paras 1.8-1.10 below) was launched during the early years of the National Programme.\n1.8 'See me'[6], the national campaign in Scotland, launched in 2002 (and initially funded by the then Scottish Executive) to tackle stigma and discrimination, used 'social marketing'[7] approaches including: national publicity campaigns delivered through paid for advertising, supported by news and features targeted at the general population; targeted publicity campaigns aimed at specific groups or environments through, for instance, young people and workplace strands; work with journalists; and support for local activity through the provision of materials, advice and guidance. In 2013 it was reviewed by the Scottish Government and the re-launched 'see me' was launched in Nov 2013 (see Para 1.12).\n1.9 The suicide prevention strategy 'Choose Life' (Scottish Government, 2002a) was also launched in 2002. Objectives for 'Choose Life' included raising awareness of the risk and protective factors for suicide; ensuring earlier and more effective care and support; improving and increasing the provision of services; removing stigma; providing support to families; improving the sensitivity of media reporting of suicide; and improving data collection. In addition Breathing Space[8] was launched as a free, confidential phone and web based service for people in Scotland experiencing low mood, depression or anxiety.\n1.10 The Scottish Recovery Network (SRN), also funded by the Scottish Government, was launched in 2004 to promote and support recovery from mental health problems. A key element of the SRN's strategic plan is to ensure that mental health services and support are provided in a way which focuses on recovery. In addition, NHS Health Scotland was designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Health Promotion and Public Health Development in 2005.\n1.11 Policy approaches to improving mental health and wellbeing and to reducing the stigma, discrimination, and social isolation experienced by those with mental health problems have continued to evolve in recent years. Towards a Mentally Flourishing Scotland: Policy and Action Plan 2009-2011 (Scottish Government, 2009a) identified six strategic priorities[9] one of which, 'improving the quality of life of those experiencing mental health problems and mental illness', relates to reducing discrimination and stigma, and promoting social inclusion, physical health, and recovery. Most recently, following the introduction of the Equality Act 2010, which provided legal rights for disabled people (including those with mental health problems), the Scottish Government published The Mental Health Strategy for Scotland: 2012-2015 (Scottish Government, 2012). This identified seven themes[10] including two on discrimination and recovery which are particularly pertinent to the module of questions developed for SSA 2013.\n1.12 In 2013, a new £4.5 million investment to build on the 'see me' campaign, funded jointly by the Scottish Government and Comic Relief, was announced[11]. The new three year programme[12] is focused on building a broad movement of people in Scotland to tackle stigma and discrimination and changing behaviour in targeted settings to bring increased equality and life opportunity to people with mental health problems.\n1.13 Most recently, SRN launched a new website 'Write to Recovery' where people can write and publish their stories as a way of promoting and supporting mental health recovery\nDoc 5(Title: \"1 Introduction - Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland ...\") ad a mental health problem; whether or not people tell others about their mental health problems; and the social impact of having a mental health problem\n- Chapter three looks at attitudes to recovery and the nature of the messages people with mental health problems receive about recovery from professionals, and from family and/or friends\n- Chapter four summarises the findings on general perceptions of people with mental health problems, including myths and stereotypes\n- Chapter five focuses on attitudes to those who experience specific mental health problems\n- Chapter six summarises the main findings and conclusions.\nAbout the data\n1.24 The Scottish Social Attitudes survey was established by ScotCen Social Research, an independent organisation based in Edinburgh and part of NatCen Social Research, the UK's largest independent social research agency. The survey provides robust data on changing social and political attitudes to inform both public policy and academic study. Around 1,500 face-to-face interviews are conducted annually (1,497 in 2013) with a representative probability sample of the Scottish population. Interviews are conducted in respondents' homes, using computer assisted personal interviewing. Most of the interview is conducted face-to-face by a ScotCen interviewer, but some questions each year are asked in a self-completion section. The survey has achieved a response rate of between 54% and 65% in each year since 1999 (in 2013, the response rate was 55%). The data are weighted to correct for over-sampling, non-response bias and to ensure they reflect the sex-age profile of the Scottish population. All sample sizes shown below the charts and tables show unweighted bases. Further technical details about the survey are included in Annex B.\n1.25 Methodological changes were implemented between the Well? survey series and SSA 2013. There were changes to the method of data collection for questions asked of those who had experienced mental health problems (face-to-face in the Well? survey series and self-complete in SSA 2013). There were also some alterations to question wording and question ordering[17]. While these methodological differences are unlikely to affect the substantive conclusions, they do mean that some caution is required in interpreting trends.\nLimitations of the data\n1.26 The Scottish Social Attitudes survey is a quantitative survey which focuses on producing robust and reliable population estimates across a wide range of substantive topics. In common with other general population surveys, individuals living in specific settings where the incidence of mental health problems is known to be high (e.g. prisons, hospitals, residential care facilities) are not included in the sample. The survey does not allow questions about respondents' motivations or feelings to be examined in depth; this would require more detailed research using qualitative methods.\n1.27 Questions for the SSA survey are developed through a rigorous and detailed process involving cognitive testing and extensive piloting. There is also discussion on a question-by-question basis of whether the most suitable approach is to use face-to-face or self-complete methods. This ensures that as far as possible questions will be interpreted in a uniform fashion, and that any social desirability bias - especially in relation to sensitive questions - will be minimised. However, it is acknowledged that variation in how questions are interpreted by respondents and the possibility of social desirability bias in such a complex area as mental health cannot be completely eliminated.\nAnalysis and reporting conventions\n1.28 All percentages cited in this report are based on the weighted data (see Annex B for details) and are rounded to the nearest whole number. All differences described in the text (between years, or between different groups of people) are statistically significant at the 95% level or above, unless otherwise specified.

Even though we are primarily focused on the process of creating, the final product that comes from this type of project typically ends up being a cute and happy accident!\nLet’s take a look at what process art is and how beneficial it is for kids of all ages.\nI have had some amazing discussions with coworkers and other educators about process art for kids. And I am a BIG fan of open-ended art experiences for kids.\nSo I’m excited to share some of that information here. I’d love to hear about your thoughts on the topic in the comments below.\nWhat is Process Art for Kids?\nProcess art is a contemporary artistic movement recognized within the world’s art communities.\nThe Guggenheim states,\nprocess art emphasizes the ‘process’ of making art.\nThe MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) points out,\nin process art, the means count for more than the ends.\nRelated: Watercolor Art for Kids\nThese definitions apply directly to kids too!\nProcess art is all about the experience the children have while they’re creating.\nIf it has a nice end product, that’s great, but the end product isn’t the focus of the art.\nAsk yourself the questions below if you’re unsure. If the answer to either is “YES!” then it is not a process art activity.\n- “Will I be upset if the end result doesn’t look a specific way?”\n- “Do I have a preconceived notion about what the end result ‘should’ look like?”\nRelated: Cardboard Castles Recycled Art Project\nBenefits of Process Art for Preschoolers\nChildren learn through play and open-ended activities. It allows them the chance to explore the world around them, ask questions, and see how things work.\nProcess art fits in with how children learn because it allows them room to be themselves, make their own decisions, and just create!\nBelow you’ll find some of the learning that can take place via process art activities:\n- Fine motor skills\n- Gross motor skills and coordination\n- Sensory exploration\n- Literacy\n- Math\n- Science\n- Language\n- Art history\n- Creativity and self-expression\n- Art techniques\n- Risk-taking\n- Spatial reasoning\nI just want to point out that the above list is by no means exhaustive. AND these benefits apply beyond the preschool years.\nRelated: Winter Process Art\nCrafts Versus Process Art\nIt’s sometimes assumed (by parents and teachers alike) that young children will always produce cute crafts to bring home.\nThere’s nothing wrong with crafts – they can help improve fine motor skills, as well as listening skills, and many children really do enjoy them.\nCrafts focus more on a specific end result, though, leaving children little or no room to deviate from the plan. At the end of a craft, each child’s piece will look almost identical to every other child’s piece.\nAdditionally, crafts put more of the preparation and “work” on the teacher’s shoulders.\nProcess Based Art Based on Crafts\nYou can most definitely “translate” crafts into more process-based art activities.\nFor example, maybe your class is learning about caterpillars and you’d like to make a caterpillar craft. The craft would use three green circles, along with two white construction paper eyes placed only on the head, with two yellow antennae that must be affixed in only one place.\nWhy not just grab the materials you were planning on using, sit down with a small group of children (or just one child), and say, “Let’s make a caterpillar! How can we use these green circles to make a caterpillar?”\nYes, some of the caterpillars will have a body made of 10 circles, while others will just be made of 1 circle. Some caterpillars might have 5 eyes all placed on the caterpillar’s stomach, and the antennae might be bent the wrong way.\nYou can give the children the same general materials you would have used for the craft, but let the kids direct the creation. You’ll still have\nDoc 2(Title: \"What is Process Art for Kids and Why is It Important ...\") rs will just be made of 1 circle. Some caterpillars might have 5 eyes all placed on the caterpillar’s stomach, and the antennae might be bent the wrong way.\nYou can give the children the same general materials you would have used for the craft, but let the kids direct the creation. You’ll still have caterpillars . . . they’ll just have more personality!\nRelated: Benefits of Messy Play\nIn its purest form, though, process art isn’t focused on an outcome at all.\nPersonally, I like incorporating completely child-driven art into my preschool class every day.\nI also plan process-based art activities that have a general outcome, like my students’ cookie cutter snowmen. While that isn’t 100% process art, I like how such activities connect kids to books we’ve read or themes we’ve investigated.\nGetting Started\nIf process art isn’t something you’re entirely comfortable with, start slowly! It doesn’t need to be a super complicated activity.\nIt just needs to be open-ended, with more attention paid to HOW the art is created (rather than WHAT you want the art to look like).\nBegin with items like crayons, pencils, or markers. Items that are familiar to both you and your students will make the transition easier.\nRelated: Halloween Contact Paper Art\nKeep in mind that process art for kids, like any childhood activity, can get messy.\nHaving a plan in place to deal with that mess is important.\n- Access to a water source (a sink or a hose) is preferable.\n- Baby wipes work in a pinch if you’re not right by a sink.\n- Consider something to protect the children’s clothing (a smock), if needed.\n- Don’t forget about keeping the mess off of the floor if that’s a cause for concern (use a tarp, towel, or tablecloth).\n- Having a place to dry artwork is also important (a drying rack or level shelf).\nIf the activity might get messy, accept that messiness is part of the process!\nMore Information About Process Art for Kids\nHere are a few more articles to read if you’re as interested in process-based art as I am!\nWhat Do You Wish You Had Known about Making Art with Children? from Tinkerlab\nArt for Kids – It’s No Mess from Meri Cherry\nIt’s the Process Not the Product! from Ooey Gooey\nHow Process-Focused Art Experiences Support Preschoolers from NAEYC\nPrint Resources to Check Out\nIf you’d rather explore more of the concept using printed resources, I have a few suggestions for you!\nTime to Create: Hands-On Explorations by Christie Burnett\nIt’s the Process, Not the Product by MaryAnn F.

What matters is the process of creating it! Personally, I like to include a combination of familiar and novel materials when presenting the students with an opportunity for process art.\nIf you’re looking for some ideas for materials to use, I’ve got you covered. Here are my suggestions (I may get commissions for purchases made through links in this post):\n- Colored sand\n- Assorted tissue paper\n- Liquid droppers\n- Washable paint\n- Liquid watercolors\n- Chalk\n- Assorted cookie cutters\n- Feathers\n- Gathered natural materials\nThis is one list of materials that can seriously be endless.

Every interaction could lead to a potential sale or referral. Discussing art can captivate many, offering an opportunity to share your work.

Yet, art pricing is complex, influenced by the artist’s perceived value and timing.\nTo succeed financially, artists must stand out with unique or exceptional work, keeping up with trends without being dominated by them. A strong, distinct style developed through constant skill improvement is essential.\nPersistence and resilience are key, as the art world often involves criticism. A thick skin helps in distinguishing helpful feedback from negativity. Art’s subjective nature means finding the right audience is crucial, with a willingness to adapt if necessary.\nDiscipline and financial prudence are important for managing a creative business, especially initially. Branding and presentation enhance first impressions, with platforms like Behance and DeviantArt useful for showcasing work. High-quality presentation and selecting standout pieces for your portfolio are advised.\nConnections with other artists offer support, collaboration opportunities, and mutual referrals. Artist communities on social media provide a valuable resource for advice and support.\nLast Word Earning Money as an Artist\nBeyond talent, artists need to adopt a business mindset to navigate the competitive online landscape, requiring hard work, patience, and strategic marketing to sell art and make a living.\nStarting as an artist involves learning from successful peers and adopting effective marketing strategies, with perseverance and a business-oriented approach key to achieving success.\nKeep the conversation going...\nOver 10,000 of us are having daily conversations over in our free Facebook group and we'd love to see you there.

Then, when I ask them to engage through the roles that they play in their professional life, they are willing to engage in another school.\nHow we choose or select our own identity influences what we’re willing to engage with and how we engage. We really need to be cognizant of how we’re asking people to engage and through which lenses they are seeing the world, both in the current system and what the system could look like in the future.\nI think that’s particularly relevant with parents because they grew up in the same system. There’s no reason why they should suddenly be able to reimagine the system today. We have to do it as a collective effort and a collective narrative. I recognize that’s not a concrete idea, but I think we make assumptions that people are going to imagine something different from what they experienced.\nIt’s why I work with artists so much. They get us out of our boxes and open us up to permeate the disciplines and other ways of creative thinking that our experience in the education system can sometimes limit us from accessing.\nQ. What would you tell people who are doing the work of leveraging community assets from a learner-centered perspective?\nTimothy Jones: Don’t worry about the pace of the change at the onset. You never get to fully understand the impact when you first start out. As much as you can, document and allow recipients of services to tell their story. There’s so much going on that it can almost paralyze you and make you feel powerless. But, you’ll see more possibilities if you change that perspective to, “There’s so much going on, that, if I just try my best, I’m going to find a way to make an impact.”\nJosh Schachter: In our culture and society, we talk about innovation a lot. Everyone wants to be an innovator and, as someone that was an educator, that’s now running a tech-focused nonprofit, I’ve come to realize that most innovation involves failure, humility, and iteration.\nWe have to embrace it. If we’re not willing to be learners in this process, listen to what we’ve learned, and adapt, then we’re not going to be able to get out of the current situation. We’re not going to get it right the first or second time, but maybe that’s the point. Isn’t that the point of learning?\nIt’s the journey of learning that creates the desire to learn. I think we need to have the humility to remember that is going to be central to whatever we’re going to create, and resist the pressure of funders and others who want us to present the outcomes and the outputs before we even start the process. That type of thinking probably isn’t going to get us where we need to go because we may not know exactly where we’re headed.\nI think there are bright spots that we can learn from, and we need to highlight those bright spots and share the lessons learned across our networks.\nJoe Hobot: I’m drawing from my experience as an Indigenous man within an Indigenous community, who’s had its youth be forced under subjugated protocols of a dominant culture until we reached an existential crisis with our language, our customs, and the corrosive effect education is having.\nMy advice, and what I’ve learned, is to be bold. The best examples of educational practices that have been working; they just dreamed it up and did it. After about two decades of protracted investigation and research into public education reform, and the academic achievements of the various communities of color within this country, we’ve come to understand that we’re in this “emperor has no clothes” moment.\nIt’s time to shed that fear that you’re going to need to have official approval of the systems in place and just do it. Dream it up and do it. Take care of your youth, educate them, and particularly in a culturally contextualized way that lifts them up and hardens them as valued individuals.

    "question": "what environmental issues gave people reason to speak out and demand change in 1970?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it is clear that in 1970, several environmental issues gave people reason to speak out and demand change. One of the major issues was air pollution, especially related to car emissions, which contributed to smoggy skies, particularly noted in Los Angeles.

Rather than investing in infrastructure to support renewable energy and focusing efforts on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, for example, countries could revert back to the status quo in a bid to recoup coronavirus-related economic losses.\nBut the path ahead won’t be easy. Humanity is quickly running out of time to keep global warming below2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and slow the most damaging impacts of climate change. And even with aggressive action, the planet is still at risk of rising seas, drought, wildfires, extreme weather and other potentially damaging consequences of the warming that has already happened.\nStill, David Muth remembers when taking environmental action wasn’t always a partisan fight.\nAs the director of Gulf restoration for the National Wildlife Federation, Muth knows that climate policies have always been hard-won, but beginning in the 1960s, as the severity of human-caused pollution was becoming more apparent, people started to demand change.\nIt was a movement that sparked huge protests, teach-ins and culminated in the organization of the first Earth Day, an event devoted to raising public awareness about threats to the environment.\nThe mobilized efforts paid off. Over the next decade, a flurry of science-based legislation aimed at protecting the planet was introduced — a legislative heyday for environmentalists that included the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Endangered Species Act in 1973, among others.\n“We cleaned up the surface waters of the United States, we cleaned up the air, we salvaged many species on the brink of extinction, we took a hard look at how we treat wetlands and barrier islands, and we didn’t do a lot of stupid things because of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Muth said. “All these seminal pieces of legislation were passed in the 1970s.”\nThis period of time was significant because it kicked off an era of mostly bipartisan support for environmental action, said Mann, who rose to prominence after publishing a paper in 1998 that showed temperature changes on Earth over the past millennium. The plot, which was almost flat before curving sharply upward in the 20th century from human activities, was dubbed the “hockey stick” and has become an iconic representation of humanity’s role in global warming.\nThough support for climate science now tends to be divided along party lines, many key environmental policies were introduced by Republican administrations, including those of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.\nWhile not perfect, some of the most pivotal environmental policies from the 1970s have had a demonstrable impact. In an editorial published April 17 in the journal Science, James Morton Turner, an associate professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, and Andrew Isenberg, a professor of Ame\nDoc 2(Title: \"Earth Day at 50: Why the legacy of the 1970s environmental ...\") le not perfect, some of the most pivotal environmental policies from the 1970s have had a demonstrable impact. In an editorial published April 17 in the journal Science, James Morton Turner, an associate professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, and Andrew Isenberg, a professor of American history at the University of Kansas, examined their legacy.\n“In 2010, the Clean Air Act and its 1990 amendments were estimated to prevent 3.2 million lost school days, 13 million lost workdays, and 160,000 premature deaths,” they wrote. “The Clean Water Act is responsible for substantial declines in most major water pollutants. Scientists estimate that the Endangered Species Act has prevented the extinction of 291 species and helped 39 species to a full recovery.”\nBut President Donald Trump has moved to significantly weaken many existing environmental protections.\nIn August 2019, the Trump administration announced changes to how the Endangered Species Act would be applied, reducing protections for some species while also making it easier to remove a species’ endangered classification. The following month, the administration rolled back clean water regulations implemented by the Obama administration that limited chemicals and harmful substances that could flow into streams and other waterways. And in November 2019, Trump began the year-long process of withdrawing from the landmark Paris climate agreement.\nAccording to The New York Times, these changes are among more than 90 environmental rules that have been reversed or weakened since Trump took office.\n“It’s very frustrating, this whole attack on our system of environmental protection,” Muth said. “We’re rolling the dice unnecessarily.”\nBut the post-pandemic recovery period could also give countries a chance to reassess.\n“As we move out of the emergency response phase, do we put investments into the economy of the future, or do we put everything back to where it was?” said Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University.\nBut the pandemic could also induce the opposite response, by forcing people to take stock of their values and broader societal goals. For instance, the outbreak demonstrated how lifestyle changes can have an impact — however fleeting — on the environment. Countries under coronavirus lockdowns, such as China, Italy and the U.S., experienced unintended climate benefits such as declines in pollution and greenhouse gases as a result of reduced air travel, restrictions on movement within cities and significant slowdowns of industrial activities.\nWhile these climate benefits are only temporary, they did demonstrate what can happen even on short-term scales, according to Mann.\n“We can see in real time the impact that we can have on the environment if we choose to curtail certain type of activities,” he said.\nThe pandemic has also demonstrated the importance of cooperation among countries on matters of global importance. After all, climate change — like a virus — pays no regard to borders.\nMann maintains that though the post-coronavirus recovery will likely be challenging, the pandemic’s silver lining could be that it sets off efforts to protect the health and safety of people, their communities and the planet — similar to the citizen-led initiatives that surrounded the first Earth Day celebrations.\n“We have a real opportunity here for change,” he said. “As they say, it’s always darkest before dawn. We may see the tipping point we’ve all been waiting for on climate change action.”\nDoc 3(Title: \"Major Laws That Changed The Workplace Over The Last 100 ...\") th the 1964 Civil Rights Act now applied to older workers.\nOccupational Safety and Health Act\nThe 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act required employers to protect their workers from the factory fires, farming accidents, mine collapses, and black lung disease that compelled the earliest labor activists to organize in the first place. The legislation forced employers to safeguard their workers from things like excessive heat and cold, mechanical dangers, unsanitary conditions, toxic substances, and other known physical hazards. It also created and empowered OSHA to enforce the legislation.\nEmployee Retirement and Security Income Act\nThe 1974 Employee Retirement and Security Income Act protected workers not from on-the-job hazards, but from shady players who frequently plundered or misspent their retirement savings. The legislation set minimum standards for private-industry pension plans and required companies to disclose information about the plans and how they were managed while also putting fiduciary responsibility on whoever is in charge of their assets.\n1978: Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act\nIn 1978, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act extended to most civilian federal employees the right to unionize, organize, and bargain collectively. It did not protect postal employees, who are covered by legislation specifically written for their industry.\nPregnancy Discrimination Act\nPrior to 1978, courts held that although discrimination based on pregnancy affects only women, it still wasn't considered sex-based discrimination. In 1978, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act amended Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to prohibit sex discrimination based on pregnancy.\n1988: Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act\nBefore the 1988 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which was enacted by Congress without President Ronald Reagan's signature, companies, plants, mines, and other places of business could close without warning, leaving their employees one paycheck away from financial calamity. The new legislation, however, forced most companies with more than 100 employees to give 60 days' written notice in the case of imminent mass layoffs or closings.\n1990: Americans With Disabilities Act\nIn 1990, the 1964 Civil Rights Act was amended yet again when the Americans With Disabilities Act expanded the legislation to include workers with disabilities. Aside from preventing discrimination, the act also required employers to make reasonable accommodations for special needs regarding accessibility.\n1993: Family and Medical Leave Act\nVirtually all wealthy Western countries require employers to provide paid maternity or paternity leave—all except the United States. That remains the case today, but in 1993, new moms and dads got some reprieve with the Family and Medical Leave Act, which mandated 12 job-protected work weeks a year for things like the birth, adoption, and some other circumstances. Ever since, time off has been guaranteed, but not compensated.\n2009: Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act\nIn 2009, the 1964 Civil Rights Act was amended again when President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was named for the Supreme Court plaintiff whose case led to the legislation. The act gave employees more time to file equal-pay lawsuits after learning they were being paid less than someone of the opposite gender for equal work.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Air pollution over the last 50 years - Filtermist\") This year's World Environment Day on June 5th is focussing on Air Pollution and what can be done globally to reduce air pollution to help combat climate change.\nAir pollution is not a new problem – in fact, experts now know humans have been responsible for an increase in pollutants for at least 2,100 years. By extracting layers of ice which have accumulated in Greenland over many millennia and analysing the methane trapped within them, scientists have been able to link increased levels with activity we know civilisations such as the Ancient Romans and the Han Dynasty in China were undertaking at the time.\nDespite humans being aware of pollution for many decades (and having caused it for many more), our knowledge has grown exponentially over the last 50 years. So too have the efforts to reverse the trend by environmental groups, scientists, Governments and world leaders. Since Filtermist first began producing oil mist filters to help workplaces reduce their emissions in 1969, we have seen huge developments – but there are still regions of the world where pollution levels are increasing far above those acceptable as set down by legislation, and there are still individuals and employers who don’t comprehend the full scale of the problem and the negative impacts of pollutants like oil mist and dust.\nAir pollution is defined as a ‘mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both inside and outside’ – excess pollution has an impact on the environment (including contributing to rising temperatures across the globe) and humans too: through diseases caused by poor air quality. Hundreds of thousands of deaths each year are attributed to pollutants.\nIn this guide, we take a look at how emission levels, our knowledge and the regulations have changed in the past 50 years since Filtermist launched – and what could happen in the future if they are not reversed.\nEmissions over the years:\nThere are many different substances which class as air pollution when released into the atmosphere, including carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter (PM). The latter has been the primary concern of Filtermist since its inception 50 years ago, given this category includes oil mist particles which can be emitted as a by-product of various metal machining processes across multiple industries. PM can be divided into categories depending on the size of each individual particle: PM10 comprises of particles less than 10µm which can enter the lungs when inhaled, while PM2.5 can permeate the gas-exchange regions of the lungs and enter into the blood stream.\nSince the 1970s, the majority of countries have seen a decline in exposure to PM2.5, at least partially thanks to stricter regulations. But countries including India, China and Greece have all seen an increase3. In the UK, emissions have dropped significantly from 639,000 tonnes of PM10 and 498,000 tonnes of PM2.5 each year to 169,000 and 106,000 respectively.\nIn America, fewer than 20 per cent of city residents are exposed to PM10 and PM2.5 levels above the WHO Air Quality Guidelines. In higher-income countries in Europe, more than 60 per cent are exposed to higher levels, rising to more than 90 per cent when we look at lower- and middle-income European countries. However, the situation is worse in the Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, South-East Asia, and lower- and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific where between 95 and 100 per cent of cities are exposed to these above-guideline levels.\nIt’s not just a minor problem either, some of the cities are exposed to levels between six and ten times what the guidelines advise is acceptable.\nLevels have undoubtedly risen over the past 50 years, even when comparing data from a much shorter period (2008 to 2013) there is an eight per cent rise in annual mean concentrations of PM2.5. While high-income regions have seen a decrease, there has been a marked increase in pollution levels in low and medium-income regions.\nRegulations:\nDoc 5(Title: \"Timeline of Major Accomplishments in Transportation Air Pollution and ...\") Timeline of Major Accomplishments in Transportation, Air Pollution, and Climate Change\nAir pollution and cars were first linked in the early 1950’s by a California researcher who determined that pollutants from traffic was to blame for the smoggy skies over Los Angeles. At the time, typical new cars were emitting nearly 13 grams per mile hydrocarbons (HC), 3.6 grams per mile nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 87 grams per mile carbon monoxide (CO). Since then, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set standards to bring down levels of these pollutants, and the auto industry has responded by developing new emission control technologies.\nOver time, Congress authorized EPA to regulate emissions from other mobile sources of air pollution, such as heavy-duty trucks, agricultural and construction equipment, locomotives, lawn and garden equipment, and marine engines. These milestones in controlling emissions from mobile sources involve a variety of approaches including technological advances in engine design to higher quality fuels. This integrated approach to mobile source emission control also depends on extensive collaboration between EPA; vehicle, engine, and fuel manufacturers; state and local governments; transportation planners; and individual citizens.\n1970\nCongress passes the first major Clean Air Act, requiring a 90 percent reduction in emissions from new automobiles by 1975. President Richard Nixon establishes EPA, and the new agency is given it broad responsibility for regulating motor vehicle pollution. New cars must meet EPA emission standards for hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx). The law also directs EPA to set health-based \"National Ambient Air Quality Standards\" for six pollutants.\n1971\nEPA begins testing the fuel economy of cars, trucks, and other vehicles, the first step towards informing consumers about the gas mileage of their vehicles.\n1972\nExhaust gas recirculation valves are developed as automakers strive to meet NOx standards.\n1973\nEPA creates new transportation controls in some of the nation’s largest cities, including Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, and others. Measures include exclusive bus lanes, bypass lanes for carpools and buses, parking garages and restrictions, and a mass transit incentive plan for California employers.\nEPA releases a study confirming that lead from automobile exhaust poses a direct threat to public health. Later that year, EPA issues final regulations to gradually reducing lead in gasoline.\n1975\nCongress passes the Energy Policy Conservation Act, setting the first fuel economy goals. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program establishes a phase-in of more stringent fuel economy standards beginning with 1975 model vehicles.\nThe \"first generation\" catalytic converters are built, significantly reducing vehicle emissions. Unleaded gasoline is also introduced because lead in gasoline may cause disintegration of catalytic converters. This results in dramatic reductions in ambient lead levels and alleviates many serious environmental and human health concerns associated with lead pollution.\n1977\nCongress amends the Clean Air Act which set a schedule for continued reductions in emissions from automobiles.\n1981\nNew cars meet the amended Clean Air Act standards for the first time. Sophisticated three-way catalysts with on-board computers and oxygen sensors appear in most new cars, helping to optimize the efficiency of the catalytic converter.\n1983\nInspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs are established in areas with air pollution problems, requiring passenger vehicles to undergo periodic testing for malfunctioning emission control systems.\n1985\nEPA sets stringent standards for emissions of NOx from heavy-duty engines and of PM from heavy-duty diesel-powered trucks and buses.\nEPA issues final regulations to cut the amount of lead in gasoline by 90 percent starting January 1, 1986. The new standard is 0.10 grams per gallon.\n1989\nFor the first time, EPA s\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that in 1970, several environmental issues gave people reason to speak out and demand change. One of the major issues was air pollution, especially related to car emissions, which contributed to smoggy skies, particularly noted in Los Angeles. Another issue was the general awareness and concern about environmental degradation which eventually led to the establishment of Earth Day and subsequent environmental legislations.\n\nBased on the information, the primary environmental issue leading to demands for change in 1970 was:\n\n<answer> air pollution </answer>\n\nSpecifically, car emissions and resultant air quality issues were major factors."

The rate of abuse among individuals with a history of abuse is approximately six times higher than the base rate for abuse in the general population. Although this suggests that being maltreated as a child is an important risk factor in the etiology of abuse, most maltreated children do not become abusive parents. Many mediating factors affect the likelihood of intergenerational abuse. Consequently, unqualified acceptance of the intergenerational hypothesis is unwarranted. 41 references.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Will children who get sexually abused become sexually abusive as teens ...\") Will children who get sexually abused become sexually abusive as teens or adults?\nThe vast majority of sexual abuse survivors live their lives without ever sexually abusing others.\nWhat percentage of child victims of sexual abuse become abusive?\nAlthough adults who have sexually abused a child are more likely to have been sexually abused as a child [3], children and teens who have been sexually abused are no more likely to sexually abuse someone else [8]. One way to look at this is to consider that in actuality, female children are more often sexually abused than male children [4], yet over 90% of people who sexually abuse children are male [6]. Also, even though some kids who hurt others have been hurt themselves, many have not been abused [7].\nWhy do children who sexually abuse sometimes become abusive?\nThere are many reasons why a child might act out sexually, such as problems controlling their impulses, seeing inappropriate material, having a disability, or dealing with stress at home or in their environment [5]. Primarily, when a person is exposed to traumas in childhood, they are more likely to have difficulties in other areas of their lives as they grow into adults, like relationships, safety, decision making, mental health, and physical wellbeing [1, 2].\nHow to ensure children who have been sexually abused do not abuse others.\nIntervention - help and support - is crucial after a child has been abused. Acknowledging and addressing the distress a child has experienced is the way to begin ending this abusive cycle and to helping a child recover. Experts and parents agree that with specialized treatment children who have been sexually abused can heal, and do not pose a risk to other children - now or later in life.\nLearn More\n- Treatment and Support Resources for Children and Parents\n- Children and Youth with Sexual Behavior Problems\n- When a Child Tells About Sexual Abuse\nReturn to FAQs\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nReferences\n[1] Almuneef, M.

The latest senseless killing of George Floyd seems to have united many to stand up against police violence against African Americans. But there is another cycle of violence we also need to focus on—the cycle of abuse in our homes.\nIf we ever hope to bring more peace into our world, we must start by ending the emotional, physical, and sexual violence that occurs in our homes. Having made the connection between childhood abuse and adult abuse and violence, we need only expand this knowledge to help us understand the violence that occurs in our communities.\nChildren who are neglected or abused in the home are far more likely to become either bullies in school or the victims of bullies. Many of the students who have taken up arms at school were found to have been the target of vicious bullying by their classmates. And we know that a majority of those in prison for violent crimes were either emotionally, physically, or sexually abused as children.\nThose who are mistreated perpetuate a culture of violence that affects us all. Therefore, the work we do on breaking the cycle of abuse in our own families will have even greater ramifications for society at large.\nEven though many people recognize the cyclical aspect of neglect and abuse, not enough is being done to break the cycle. Those who come from abusive or neglectful backgrounds are generally not offered courses or therapeutic programs that will help them to clear up the debris of their childhood before embarking on a new life with a husband or wife. Neither are there such programs for potential parents. Most programs are offered only to those who have already begun to abuse their spouse or their children.\nShame is a significant factor in the continuation of the cycle of abuse. It is not only one of the emotions that cause the cycle to continue but it often prevents people from getting help. It is time to stop blaming and shaming those who do to others what was done to them. It does no good to make monsters out of those who continue the cycle of violence by abusing their children or their partner. This only serves to harden them even more and make them less inclined to reach out for help.\nIt has become overwhelmingly clear that people don’t just “get over” child abuse. They continue to suffer and even more importantly, they pass on the abuse to other people. If you were emotionally, physically, or sexually abused as a child or adolescent, or if you experienced neglect or abandonment, it isn’t a question of whether you will continue the cycle of abuse or neglect, it is a question of how you will do so—whether you will become an abuser or continue to be a victim.\nAlthough this may sound unnecessarily negative to you, it is the truth. Research clearly shows that those who have been abused either absorb abuse or pass it on. In the past 25 years, studies on abuse and family assaults strongly suggest that abused children often become abusers themselves and that child victims of violence become violent adults. Individuals with a history of childhood abuse are four times more likely to assault family members or sexual partners than are individuals without such a history. Females who have a history of being abused in childhood are far more likely to continue being victimized as adults.\nBut we don’t need research to tell us what we know intuitively. If abuse and neglect were not passed down from generation to generation, we simply would not have the epidemic of childhood abuse and neglect we are experiencing today. “But I know plenty of people who were abused or neglected as children who did not grow up to be abusers or victims,” you might counter. Even though I’m sure there are a number of survivors you can think of who seem, on the surface, to be leading normal, healthy lives, I can assure you\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Myth Of The Abused Becoming Abusers | Defend Innocence\") As a young college student, I decided that I didn’t like golf. I learned that golf actually stood for “Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden” and my hatred for the sport was solidified. I spent years railing against golf and the sexist acronym behind it.\nExcept it wasn’t true. I learned a few weeks ago that it’s a common myth, something repeated because it seems true, even though it isn’t.\nThis is relatively harmless compared to some myths—like the one that most perpetrators of child sexual abuse were once abused themselves. Or, in other words, that if someone is sexually abused as a child they are more likely to become an abuser when they grow up.\nOf course, there are sexual abusers who were abused as children, but it isn’t as frequent or common as most people, even therapists, believe. In her book Predators, Anna C. Salter talks about how most men convicted of child sexual abuse will simply say that they were abused as children because it affords them more sympathy. In reality, fewer than 10% of them actually were.\nSo, what does this mean to you, as a parent?\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, there is a strong indication that children who are abused are more likely to become abusers later in life, but it's not an absolute certainty.

So sometimes, although you don't have any particular worries you can recognize off the top of your head, your body reminds you that you're still anxious underneath it all. The physical symptoms of anxiety can show up any time, even when you least expect it.\nWhile you may consider anxiety to be all about your thoughts, it's actually a pretty full-body experience. So even when you aren't having a particularly stressful day or night, anxiety can still be present in your system. \"Anxiety is a highly physiological experience,\" Joshua Klapow, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and host of The Kurre and Klapow Show, tells Bustle. \"So many of the symptoms of anxiety can intertwine physical, cognitive and emotional experiences. It’s not uncommon for people experiencing anxiety to not be aware or not link what they are experiencing to that of being anxious because the experience is so physiological.\" Treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy may be able to help you find the connection between your thoughts and your feelings, but you can also start by better understanding what physical symptoms may be connected to feelings of distress.\nExperiences like panic attacks can be more obvious, but anxiety's daily symptoms are sometimes so subtle that you may not interpret them correctly right away. Luckily, these symptoms are well-studied, so a psychologist can help you identify what may not be obvious at first.\nHere are 10 physical ways anxiety can manifest itself, even when you're not feeling stressed, according to experts.\n1You Might Grind Your Teeth\nIf you've ever woken up in the morning with a tight jaw, or had a dentist mention you might grind your teeth, you may be experiencing a common but less-obvious symptom of anxiety.\n\"People can grind their teeth when they don't know they're anxious at night,\" Terry Eagan, M.D., chief psychiatric officer at Alsana, tells Bustle. If you want to stop grinding your teeth, you can either buy anti-teeth-grinding products, or try anxiety treatment methods, or both.\n2You May Have Difficulty Breathing\nIf you've ever noticed yourself having trouble breathing, even when you don't seem particularly stressed, then you may be experiencing symptoms of anxiety.\n\"Another physical symptom is rapid [or] shallow breathing (hyperventilation),\" licensed clinical social worker Sheilah Ledesma, owner of Lighter Living Counseling, tells Bustle. \"Even when a person is not feeling stressed in that moment, they can become a victim of this physical symptom.\" If you are dealing with unresolved anxiety, this may be more likely. Your body may be warning you that you have some underlying issues to deal with.\n3You May Sweat More Than Usual\nNervous sweating doesn't just happen before a big speech or another stressful event. You can experience this symptom of anxiety even when you're feeling relatively calm.\n\"A person can start sweating out profusely even when nothing stressful or anxious is happening,\" Ledesma says. \"This is evidence that there is a build up of anxiety that has not been addressed. The body is so accustomed to sending anxious signals to the brain and the body responds by releasing cortisol, the stress hormone.\" Since this may be another sign that you may not be properly addressing your anxiety, you might want to seek professional help if this happens often.\n4You May Wake Up A Lot In The Night\nIf you've ever woken up in the night with a racing heart, even if you went to bed feeling fine, then you may be dealing with a physical symptom of anxiety.\n\"This physical response could be due to that person's anxious neural pathways that have been created over time,\" Ledesma says. \"The brain is powerful enough to recognize a person's thought patterns, and overtime will be conditioned to respond anxiously even when a person is not stressed.\" Finding a therapist who can address your anxiety\nDoc 2(Title: \"10 Physical Ways Anxiety Can Manifest Itself Even When You're Not ...\") however, seeking professional support may be a helpful step.\nUnfortunately, a lot of these physical signs of anxiety become apparent when anxiety goes untreated for a while. Learning to accept that stress and anxiety aren't personal failures may help you ease your symptoms. \"When we consider stress 'bad,' we actually become more stressed by the presence of stress symptoms, creating a cycle of stress we seek to avoid,\" licensed marriage and family therapist Carrie Krawiec, tells Bustle. Instead, recognizing that stress and anxiety are important ways that your body protects you, may help you forgive yourself and feel more willing to find treatment to mitigate it — not eradicate these feelings completely.\nDoc 3(Title: \"10 Physical Ways Anxiety Can Manifest Itself Even When You're Not ...\") o that person's anxious neural pathways that have been created over time,\" Ledesma says. \"The brain is powerful enough to recognize a person's thought patterns, and overtime will be conditioned to respond anxiously even when a person is not stressed.\" Finding a therapist who can address your anxiety, and perhaps focusing on clean sleeping, may prevent this from happening too often.\n5You May Make Repetitive Movements\nYou may feel like these are totally harmless habits, but tapping a pen, shaking your leg, or doing other repetitive movements could be a sign of anxiety — even if you aren't feeling stressed.\n\"[People with anxiety may] wring hands, pace, shake a leg or tap a foot,\" Dr. Klapow says. \"All of this is driven by our brain prepping the body for defense.\" Since anxiety puts your body into \"fight-or-flight\" mode, this can be a sign of your body reacting to anxiety in a very innate way. If you notice you have a repetitive habit you can't shake, it may be worth examining whether it could be tied to anxiety.\n6You May Eat Or Speak More Quickly\nJust like anxiety can cause racing thoughts, it can also speed up some of your physical processes as well.\n\"People can eat and speak more quickly even when they aren't aware,\" Eagan says. Being more mindful throughout the day may help you slow down when you notice yourself potentially being anxious, and having trouble regulating your pace.\n7You May Have Digestive Issues\nEven if you aren't thinking about anything stressful, your body switching into \"fight-or-flight\" mode can still cause all sorts of physical symptoms — including digestive upset.\n\"During the activation of the 'fight-or-flight' system, the body's ability to digest food properly decreases,\" licensed clinical social worker and licensed clinical addictions specialist, Lauren Moser Vilar, tells Bustle. \"[...] However, if we are constantly anxious our bodies do not properly digest and excrete our food intake.\" If you've noticed a change in your digestion, talking to a doctor is an important step for both your physical and mental health. Anxiety and the gut are closely linked.\n8You May Feel More Tired Than Usual\nOne reason that you may experience physical symptoms of anxiety even when you aren't stressed is because the symptoms can build up over time. And when this happens, you may begin to feel quite tired.\n\"The sympathetic system, or 'fight-or-flight' system, is very active even if you aren’t consciously aware of the work your body is doing,\" Moser Vilar says. \"Over time, the underlying anxiety can create exhaustion and fatigue.\" If you've noticed a change in your energy level, it's important to reach out to a doctor or therapist for help.\n9Your Shoulder And Neck May Feel Tense\nShoulder and neck tension are classic anxiety symptoms. If you have been dealing with anxiety for a while, this tension can become a painful physical issue even when you aren't feeling stressed.\n\"Over time, the muscle tension that we experience from stress builds up and can create neck cramps and stiff shoulders,\" Moser Vilar says. Both physical and psychological remedies may be able to ease this tension.\n10You May Feel Like You're Having An \"Out Of Body\" Experience\nDissociation can be a scary word.

In railroads, mines, farms, mills, lumber yards, sweatshops, and construction sites, the common worker performed demanding and difficult labor in conditions that were often dangerous, unsanitary, unhealthy, exploitative, or otherwise harmful.\nUnions enjoyed no real legal protection and workers organized for better pay and conditions largely at their own risk. Virtually all of the legal and political structure was organized for the benefit of the corporations that controlled the lives of the workers they employed. When soldiers or police officers used violence to break up strikes, the violence was almost always perpetrated against striking laborers at the direction of company bosses. Those bosses often enjoyed cozy relationships with politicians who steered policies and crafted legislation to maintain the status quo.\nAll that, however, was about to change. The last century has witnessed an unprecedented change in the American workplace. Starting in the 1920s, major laws were passed that guaranteed protections, redistributed power, and regulated everything from wages to hours to union management to hiring practices. Racial minorities saw new laws reverse decades of discriminatory hiring practices, as did women, immigrants, older Americans, and other vulnerable groups. Laws were enacted to improve workplace safety, to prevent child labor, and to bolster unions while preventing union bosses from exploiting their own members.\nModern workers owe their comparatively cushy conditions to the efforts of the activists and organizers who appealed for fair pay and reasonable protections at the risk of being fired, jailed, beaten, or killed. Here's a look at a century of labor laws that lifted the average American worker out of a condition of poverty and subjugation and into one that offered a much greater degree of self-determination and profit sharing.\nYou may also like: How your state gets to work\nRailway Labor Act\nIn 1926, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Railway Labor Act after decades of high-profile labor strikes, many of which were violent and even deadly. The act compelled union workers and companies in the railroad industry—which witnessed some of the most significant labor unrest—to negotiate through arbitration, bargaining, and mediation before resorting to strikes. As the first federal law that guaranteed workers the right to organize and choose their own union leaders without company interference, the act was one of the most significant reforms in history up to that point.\nDavis-Bacon Act\nThe 1931 Davis-Bacon Act required all private companies that won contracts on any significant public-works construction projects to pay workers the so-called \"prevailing wage,\" which generally corresponded with union wages. The law was necessary because the country was in the throes of the Great Depression, millions were out of work, and labor bosses frequently exploited the desperation of the unemployed by offering take-it-or-leave-it wage ultimatums. The standard remains in place today and still covers roughly 25% of construction workers at any given time.\nNorris-LaGuardia Act\nThe Norris-LaGuardia Act, enacted in 1932, was a major victory for workers seeking to organize for better pay and conditions. The law protected peaceful union strikes and protests from federal court injunctions, which had long hindered union organization efforts. It also prevented companies from firing workers for joining a union and outlawed so-called yellow-dog contracts, which required prospective employees to sign a promise not to join a union.\nNational Labor Relations Act\nThe 1935 National Labor Relations Act is among the most important legislation in labor history and remains\nDoc 4(Title: \"The 13 Colonies in the Revolutionary War\") er the war was characterized by economic depression and political crisis.\nThe thirteen states at the time were ruled by a Confederation Government that was only unified by the Articles of Confederation.

These changes were most important because they increased the benefits of exchange (the cornerstone of a market economy) and created incentives for individuals to specialize in economic activities in which they had a particular advantage and then engage in mutually advantageous exchange (trade) with individuals specializing in other economic activities. Specific provisions in the Constitution that helped to increase the benefits of exchange were those that prohibited the national and state governments from enacting ex-post-facto laws (retroactive laws) and a provision that prohibited the state governments from passing any ‘law impairing the obligation of contracts.’ These prohibitions were important to the development of a market economy because they constrained governments from interfering in economic exchange, making the returns to economic activity more secure.”\nSince the economies of the thirteen states weren’t highly interconnected in the 1780s, the immediate effect of the Constitution was small.\nYet, the creation of the Constitution was still significant because it eventually became the foundation of the national government.\nIt took nearly twenty years before the American economy turned around, but when it did, it flourished. The United States became a world power sometime in the 1870s or 1880s when its economy became the largest economy in the world.\nYet, the rest of the world didn’t see the United States as a super power until 1898 when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish-American war and took various Spanish colonies such as Cuba, Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico.\nAfter WWII, the British Empire was dismantled and the United States and the USSR were only superpowers left.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia lost its super power status and the United States has since remained the sole global super power.\nSources:\n“Economic Interests and\nDoc 5(Title: \"Emancipation Proclamation: Effects Impacts and Outcomes\") ceable due to the fact South was in a state of rebellion. What it did do however was ensure that if the North won, the South would be forced to free all of their slaves. Ultimately that would lead to the freedom of 3.1 million slaves. However, most of those slaves were not free until after the war had concluded.\nLatest US History Articles\nWho Invented the Assembly Line? Henry Ford and the History of the Assembly Line\nWho Invented the Cotton Gin? Eli Whitney and Cotton Gin Impact on America\nThe Most Famous Outlaws of the Wild West: Jesse James to Robert Leroy Parker\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was criticized on all sides of the political spectrum. The proslavery movement believed that it was wrong and immoral for the president to inflict such a thing, but their hands were tied due to the fact that they wanted the Union to be preserved. The North had originally tried to use the Emancipation Proclamation as a threat to the South.\nThe terms were simple, return to the Union or face the dire consequences of having all slaves freed. When the South refused to return, the North decided to unleash the document. This left Lincoln’s political opponents in a bind because they didn’t want to lose their slaves, but at the same time it would be a disaster if United States were to divide up into two different nations.\nThere was a lot of flak in the abolitionist movement as well. Many of the abolitionists believed that it wasn’t a sufficient document because it did not totally eradicate slavery and in fact was barely enforceable in the states that it did authorize such release. Since the South was in a state of war, there wasn’t much impetus for them to comply with the order.\nLincoln was criticized by many different factions, and even among historians there is a question as to what his motives were in his decisions. But it is important to remember that the success of the Emancipation Proclamation hinged on the victory of the North. If the North was successful and was able to seize control of the Union once again, reunifying all the states and putting the South out of its state of rebellion, it would have freed all of their slaves.\nThere was no going back from this decision. The rest of America would be forced to follow suit. This meant that Abraham Lincoln was well aware of the ramifications of his actions. He knew that the Emancipation Proclamation was not a permanent, final solution to the problem of slavery but rather it was a powerful opening salvo to an entirely new type of war.\nThis changed the purpose of the Civil War as well. Prior to the Emancipation Proclamation, the North was engaged in military action against the South due to the fact of the South was trying to secede from the Union. Originally, the war as seen by the North, was a war to preserve the unity of America. The South was trying to secede because of a myriad of reasons. There are a lot of simplistic reasons offered for why the North and the South were divided.\nThe most common reason stated is that the South wanted to have slavery and Lincoln was purely a staunch abolitionist. Another theory was that the Civil War was started because the South wanted a greater level of states’ rights, whereas the current Republican Party was pushing for a more unified type of government. The reality is that the motivations of the South’s secession is a mixed bag. It was most likely a collection of all the above ideas. To say there was a single reason for the Civil War is a massive underestimation of how politics works.\nRegardless of the South’s purpose for leaving the union, when the North made the decision to free the slaves, it became very clear that this would become an abolitionist war. The South relied heavily on their slaves in order to survive. Their economics were based primarily on a slave economy, as opposed to the North which had been developing a primarily industrial economy.\nThe North with higher level of education, weaponry, and production capability did not rely on slaves a\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, the transcontinental railroad changed America in several significant ways:\n\n1. **Reduced Travel Time**: Before the railroad, traveling from the East Coast to the West Coast took months via wagon or stagecoach or even longer via sea route.

The United States became a world power sometime in the 1870s or 1880s when its economy became the largest economy in the world.\nYet, the rest of the world didn’t see the United States as a super power until 1898 when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish-American war and took various Spanish colonies such as Cuba, Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico.\nAfter WWII, the British Empire was dismantled and the United States and the USSR were only superpowers left.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia lost its super power status and the United States has since remained the sole global super power.\nSources:\n“Economic Interests and\nDoc 5(Title: \"Emancipation Proclamation: Effects Impacts and Outcomes\") ceable due to the fact South was in a state of rebellion. What it did do however was ensure that if the North won, the South would be forced to free all of their slaves. Ultimately that would lead to the freedom of 3.1 million slaves. However, most of those slaves were not free until after the war had concluded.\nLatest US History Articles\nWho Invented the Assembly Line? Henry Ford and the History of the Assembly Line\nWho Invented the Cotton Gin? Eli Whitney and Cotton Gin Impact on America\nThe Most Famous Outlaws of the Wild West: Jesse James to Robert Leroy Parker\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was criticized on all sides of the political spectrum. The proslavery movement believed that it was wrong and immoral for the president to inflict such a thing, but their hands were tied due to the fact that they wanted the Union to be preserved. The North had originally tried to use the Emancipation Proclamation as a threat to the South.\nThe terms were simple, return to the Union or face the dire consequences of having all slaves freed. When the South refused to return, the North decided to unleash the document. This left Lincoln’s political opponents in a bind because they didn’t want to lose their slaves, but at the same time it would be a disaster if United States were to divide up into two different nations.\nThere was a lot of flak in the abolitionist movement as well. Many of the abolitionists believed that it wasn’t a sufficient document because it did not totally eradicate slavery and in fact was barely enforceable in the states that it did authorize such release. Since the South was in a state of war, there wasn’t much impetus for them to comply with the order.\nLincoln was criticized by many different factions, and even among historians there is a question as to what his motives were in his decisions. But it is important to remember that the success of the Emancipation Proclamation hinged on the victory of the North. If the North was successful and was able to seize control of the Union once again, reunifying all the states and putting the South out of its state of rebellion, it would have freed all of their slaves.\nThere was no going back from this decision. The rest of America would be forced to follow suit. This meant that Abraham Lincoln was well aware of the ramifications of his actions. He knew that the Emancipation Proclamation was not a permanent, final solution to the problem of slavery but rather it was a powerful opening salvo to an entirely new type of war.\nThis changed the purpose of the Civil War as well. Prior to the Emancipation Proclamation, the North was engaged in military action against the South due to the fact of the South was trying to secede from the Union. Originally, the war as seen by the North, was a war to preserve the unity of America. The South was trying to secede because of a myriad of reasons. There are a lot of simplistic reasons offered for why the North and the South were divided.\nThe most common reason stated is that the South wanted to have slavery and Lincoln was purely a staunch abolitionist. Another theory was that the Civil War was started because the South wanted a greater level of states’ rights, whereas the current Republican Party was pushing for a more unified type of government. The reality is that the motivations of the South’s secession is a mixed bag. It was most likely a collection of all the above ideas. To say there was a single reason for the Civil War is a massive underestimation of how politics works.\nRegardless of the South’s purpose for leaving the union, when the North made the decision to free the slaves, it became very clear that this would become an abolitionist war. The South relied heavily on their slaves in order to survive. Their economics were based primarily on a slave economy, as opposed to the North which had been developing a primarily industrial economy.\nThe North with higher level of education, weaponry, and production capability did not rely on slaves a\n</information>\n\n\nUpon considering the details provided, the railroad fundamentally shifted both labor dynamics and economic landscapes significantly.

Needless to say, it was disturbing the see such hatred and foul language being directed towards someone who had done nothing to offend her other than being Muslim. The silver lining of this story, however, was that soon after this video was taken this woman was arrested for an “alleged racially aggravated public order offence.” Of course, many people on and off social media defended her for having the right to express her opinion while others berated her for her blatant display of hatred and racism.\nHearing about this woman’s arrest got me thinking about one of the most notorious liberties that America allows its citizens: Freedom of speech. Of course, America isn’t alone there; countless nations such as Canada, the UK, Australia, and many others offer that same right. And let’s be honest, freedom of speech is a great privilege to have. Heck, it’s why I am able to write this article! Freedom of speech does have its limits in America, of course. It doesn’t apply when you threaten to incite violence or harm to someone. But unfortunately, everything else is fair game. One could argue that if that had happened here in America, the racist woman would still have gotten into legal trouble because she threatened the Muslim woman with bodily harm, but the racial abuse on its own would have been protected under freedom of speech.\nFree speech is a double edged sword because along with free speech comes hate speech, two concepts that can often be difficult to distinguish from one another. Freedom of speech allows us to express our opinions, no matter how controversial they might be, which many argue is one of the fundamental necessities in a democracy. But while the citizens and legislators of America boast about their citizens’ right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression, they fail to acknowledge their lack of provisions regarding hate speech. The citizens of America need to realize that having the legal right to do or say something does not mean that it is the right thing to do. Freedom of speech does not mean that it is morally right to dehumanize, harass, or abuse someone, no matter who they are. In America people are often afraid to call racism and prejudicial hate speech, instead referring to it as a different opinion or freedom of expression. Believe me, I understand how possessive and territorial Americans get when it comes to their right to freedom of expression, but we have take a step back and look at this from a critical standpoint and think about how detrimental hate speech is to society as a whole.\nOne of the stark contrasts between the right to freedom of expression in America versus other nations such as Canada, the UK, Australia, along with other nations is that they have laws against hate speech. None of them are necessarily fool-proof but at least they have some type of legislature against it. I understand that the controversy surrounding this is that in order for America to criminalize hate speech, it would have to legally classify and define what hate speech is, something that can be arguably difficult. But if other nations have been able to do it, why can’t America? And let’s think about it: if we had had laws against hate speech, groups like the Ku Klux Klan might never have reached its momentum, people like Donald Trump would never have made it within a hundred miles of politics, Fox News would most likely have so many cases against it that it would have to shut down. I applaud America for guaranteeing its citizens the right to freedom of expression but there need to be limitations. Otherwise, the people of America as a society risk regressing back to the days where blatant racism and discrimination was applauded and expected. If America wants to prove how progressive and open it is, the legislation needs to be amended to criminalize hate speech.

If America wants to prove how progressive and open it is, the legislation needs to be amended to criminalize hate speech. Of course, we are a long way away from even classifying what hate speech is in the legal context, let alone making sanctions against it, but we have to start somewhere, right?\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Evolution of Canadian Law - LawNow\") cation for the limitation of rights in a democracy like ours, would the violation of rights be allowed. Otherwise, the courts were given the task of fashioning an appropriate remedy for persons whose rights or freedoms had been infringed or breached.\nThe changes in Canadian laws and society flowing from the enactment of the Charter in 1982 touch virtually all aspects of our modern lives. Things which we take for granted in 2017 which resulted from enshrining our fundamental rights and freedoms include:\n- Sunday shopping (a result of our freedom of religion);\n- protection from improper and arbitrary government prying into our private affairs and the requirement for a search warrant before state officials can snoop around our private property (all parts of our rights to be protected from unreasonable search or seizure);\n- our right to speak with a lawyer if we are arrested or detained; to know all aspects of the case against us if we are charged with an offence, and to be treated fairly in the court system (all parts of our rights to fair trials);\n- the legalization of abortion (the rights of women to decide for themselves what will be done with their bodies); and\n- protection of the media from harassment or persecution for investigating and exposing government and political wrong-doing (part of the freedom of the press).\nMore recent Charter developments touching the most basic aspects of life in Canada include the legalization of gay marriage; the introduction of physician-assisted death; and innovations such as supervised injection sites.\nTo move from these general areas of how we govern ourselves, to more particular areas of law which touch our daily lives, reveals just as many examples of monumental change from 1867 to where we are today.\nCriminal Law\nIn the field of criminal law, for example, in 1867 most of our legal provisions were taken from the rulings of English judges, and the British Parliament. In 1892, however, Parliament enacted the first Canadian Criminal Code, which continues to be the main source of our criminal law today. Over the years since 1892, the Code has been amended often, in order to address new situations not foreseen in earlier years (it now includes computer offences, for example). Other amendments have included the abolition of all forms of physical punishment (flogging and hard labour, for example), and, in 1976, the death penalty.\nFamily Law\nFamily law, and divorce in particular, have also changed immensely since 1867. Until 1968 divorce was mainly governed by provincial laws which differed across the country. Many could only be divorced by an Act of Parliament: Someone wanting out of an abusive or otherwise bad marriage had to seek the assistance and support of their Member of Parliament who would introduce a Private Members Bill in the House of Commons declaring the marriage ended and the parties divorced. However, with the passage of the Divorce Act in 1968, the rules and procedures across the country were standardized, and all such matters were placed into the hands of the courts. Divorce became far more available and further change followed in 1986, when the Divorce Act was amended to simplify the situation even further through “no fault” divorces.\nAnother significant development over the last 150 years is the evolution of legal protections for spousal partners when it comes to the division of family assets. In 1867, after a divorce the ex-wife, and any children she might attempt to have living with her, were often left penniless. In the last 150 years, however, various support laws have been enacted so that now both former partners must share the obligations of child support and neither party is able to benefit unfairly from the marriage and its termination. In addition, property acquired during the marriage is to be divided equally between the former spouses, unless one side or the other can prove in court a significantly greater contribution.\nAnother major change in the area of family la\nDoc 5(Title: \"Reasons Why Laws Change - Year 12 Legal Studies\") anging values within the community for example the legalisation of abortion and the banning of smoking in pubs/clubs and in cars with minors.\nChanging community awareness:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community awareness. As a national community, we are much more informed today and aware of relevant issues largely due to the speed and efficiency of communication. As informed citizens, we put pressure on law makers to amend or introduce legislation in areas that we believe need to change. For example, Brodie's law was introduced in 2011 after a teenager ended her life due to bullying at a café where she worked. This law now makes it a serious crime (punishable by up to 10 years) to bully others in the workplace and holds spreads the responsibility of ending bullying.\nChanging Expectations of the Legal System:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to the change expectations towards our legal system. Years ago, laws were expected to regulate behaviour however people now expect the law to uphold individual rights as well as protect people from harm. As such, the law has needed to take a more active role to ensure that it remains relevant. Examples of these include online defamation, duty of care and negligence.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it appears that limits to freedom of speech exist primarily to prevent speech that can lead to incitement to violence, hate speech, and defamation.

Why does ...\") Debra Parkes is associate dean, research and graduate studies, in the law faculty at the University of Manitoba.\nMedia attention surrounding the deaths of Edward Snowshoe and Ashley Smith, who spent months or years in solitary confinement, is making it increasingly difficult for Canadians to ignore this human-rights crisis.\nThe damaging effects of solitary confinement (or segregation, as it's called in Canada) are well known. A United Nations body recently called for states to prohibit solitary for young people and people with mental illness, indeed, for anyone for more than 15 days. Yet segregation is widespread in Canadian prisons. Its use is normalized, routine and increasing, with no enforced limits.\nLast month, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published an editorial calling for an end to solitary confinement, noting that elements of psychiatric damage – anxiety, depression, perceptual distortions, paranoia and psychosis – are often evident after even a few days in solitary. Some of these effects can become permanent, particularly when the isolation is prolonged. Solitary exacerbates pre-existing medical conditions and creates new ones, including insomnia, anorexia and palpitations. The damage contributes to a variety of harms: self-injury, lashing out at correctional staff and other prisoners, suicide, inability to cope in society upon release. Solitary is harmful and counterproductive to public safety.\nGiven this mounting evidence and the growing consensus that solitary confinement violates basic human rights, why is it being employed so widely in Canada? And perhaps more importantly, what can be done to reverse this trend?\nAnnual reports of Canada's Correctional Investigator, along with a host of other studies in the federal context, show that the vast majority of segregation placements are for \"administrative,\" not disciplinary, reasons. Solitary confinement is a tool of population management and its widespread use hinders the development of more productive means of making our institutions and communities safer.\nAt the provincial and territorial level, we know little about the extent and reasons for solitary because information about the practice is generally not made public. However, records obtained through Access to Information in Manitoba revealed many provincial segregation placements for which no legal justification was recorded or where the reason was said to be \"overflow,\" a basis not authorized in law.\nAt a basic level, solitary is widely used because no one is compelling correctional authorities to do anything different. In provincial and territorial systems where independent oversight is limited, there is no incentive to change, particularly as prison populations keep growing under tough-on-crime legislation. Federally, there is no shortage of reports documenting the damage done by solitary and chronicling the failure to act on the many recommendations for reining in the practice made by task forces, commissions of inquiry and other independent bodies.\nWhat we do not need are more correctional rules and policy around segregation. As Justice Louise Arbour wrote in her 1996 inquiry report into unlawful uses of force and prolonged segregation at the Prison for Women in Kingston, \"the rule of law is absent, although rules are everywhere.\" The Globe and Mail's investigation indicates that correctional law and policy concerning segregation were breached in Edward Snowshoe's case, as they were in Ashley Smith's.\nWhat is needed then is independent external oversight and enforcement of existing law and rights. An important first step would be for Canada to ratify the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which would require Canada to have a \"national preventative mechanism\" to inspect all places of detention to ensure compliance with international human-rights standards. This would provide a measure of accountability and information to the public about the use of solitary confine\nDoc 2(Title: \"Abuse Of The Human Rights Of Prisoners In The United ...\") document\nAbuse Of The Human Rights Of Prisoners In The United States: Solitary Confinement\nDocument Date:\nFebruary 23, 2011\nDownload document\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) urges the Human Rights Council to address the widespread violations of the human rights of prisoners in the United States associated with solitary confinement and call for the adoption of appropriate measures to protect their human rights. The ACLU calls on the Council to urge the United States to take concrete and appropriate measures to end the egregious violations stemming from solitary confinement of prisoners.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Solitary Confinement is a Human Rights Issue\") Mahatma Ghandi once said: “A nation’s greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members.” Canada has used solitary confinement for prisoners for decades. In the past several years, solitary confinement has been the subject of criticism from civil libertarians and mental health advocates.\nUsually, solitary confinement involves isolating inmates in a small cell without human contact for 22 hours per day. Often called “administrative segregation”, solitary confinement has been the subject of increased scrutiny because of suicides and mental health issues suffered by prisoners who may be held for years in isolation. In A Sourcebook on Solitary Confinement, Dr. Sharon Shalev (2008), a leading international authority on solitary confinement, states that between one-third and 90% of prisoners experience some negative impacts of long-term solitary confinement. The symptoms may include insomnia, confusion, feelings of hopelessness and despair, distorted perceptions and hallucinations.\nFor over 20 years, the Correctional Investigator has criticized the overuse of solitary confinement in Canada. For example, see the Annual Report of the Office of the Correctional Investigator 2014-2015 (Annual Report, 2014-2015). The Correctional Investigator notes that solitary confinement is overused particularly for women with mental health issues, and for Indigenous and Black inmates.\nThe practice of administrative segregation is now called “Structured Intervention”.\nIn 1992, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, SC 1992, c 20 (CCRA), originally provided procedural safeguards for administrative segregation in sections 31 to 37. These may be summarized as:\n- Release from administrative segregation at the earliest appropriate time.\n- Reasonable alternatives to administrative segregation must first be explored and exhausted.\n- Inmates in administrative segregation have the same rights as those in the general inmate population, except those that cannot be exercised due to limitations specific to administrative segregation or security requirements.\n- The Correctional Service Canada shall take into consideration an offender’s state of health and health care needs in all administrative segregation decisions (Annual Report, 2014-2015).\nThere are also international guidelines called the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (also called the Nelson Mandela Rules). Rules 43 to 45:\n- prohibit indefinite or prolonged solitary confinement (over 15 days);\n- provide that solitary confinement is to be used only exceptionally; and\n- prohibit use for prisoners with mental or physical health disabilities that will be exacerbated by it.\nWhile not legally binding, Canadian courts will turn to these rules for guidance.\nIn British Columbia Civil Liberties Association v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 BCCA 228, the B.C. Court of Appeal considered whether solitary confinement violates a person’s s. 7 Charter right to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The Court confirmed that the 1992 CCRA provisions authorizing indefinite and prolonged solitary confinement, and internal rather than external review of decisions to segregate inmates in solitary confinement, violated these rights. The Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for one year.\nFor over 20 years, the Correctional Investigator has criticized the overuse of solitary confinement in Canada.In Canadian Civil Liberties Association v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 ONCA 243, the Ontario Court of Appeal provided, among others, that the CCRA provisions permitting administrative segregation for over 15 consecutive days violated a person’s s. 12 Charter right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. The Court found the violation could not be saved by s. 1 of the Charter (reasonable and justifiable violations).\nThe Supreme Court of Canada recently granted leave to the feder\nDoc 4(Title: \"Solitary Confinement is a Human Rights Issue\") regation for over 15 consecutive days violated a person’s s. 12 Charter right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. The Court found the violation could not be saved by s. 1 of the Charter (reasonable and justifiable violations).\nThe Supreme Court of Canada recently granted leave to the federal government to appeal these two cases (jointly). (See February 13, 2020 case nos. 38574 and 38814.)\nSections 31 to 37 of the CCRA were amended in November 2019. The practice of administrative segregation is now called “Structured Intervention”. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association notes:\nThese [structured Intervention] units continue to house inmates in situations of extreme isolation, however inmates are now supposed to be provided four hours daily out of cell and (or including) two hours daily of meaningful human contact, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. In addition, after hearing from CCLA and others, the law now includes a system of independent decision-makers to review decisions concerning keeping inmates in the SIUs, to consider their conditions, and to review the situation of people with mental health issues in the SIUs. The new law also addresses certain mental health supports and supports for Indigenous inmates.\nHowever, prisoner’s advocates argue that these amendments do not adequately address the concerns about solitary confinement. For example, the new provisions do not set a time limit on solitary confinement. Thus, the federal government did not adequately address concerns about the harms. Advocates do not believe a new name is adequate to address the consequences of the practice of solitary confinement. (See: J. Bronskill, (13 Feb 2020) National Post “Supreme Court of Canada to examine solitary confinement in federal prisons”.)\nMany inmates return to society eventually. It is in all of our interests to ensure they do not suffer irreversible harms while in indefinite solitary confinement.\nDoc 5(Title: \"ACLU to United Nations: Solitary Confinement Violates ...\") The ACLU's Amy Fettig appeared before the U.N. Human Rights Council today to condemn the use of solitary confinement in the United States, following a written statement we submitted last month urging the Council to address this widespread violation of human rights. Also appearing today was Juan Mendez, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, who has said before that solitary confinement can amount to torture and today called for a review and reduction of the use of solitary confinement as a matter of human rights. Mendez has also called on the United States to allow him to visit to investigate the use solitary confinement in U.S. supermax prisons; the U.S. has yet to respond.\nThe U.S. is unique among nations in its use of solitary confinement as an integral and regular component of its treatment of prisoners. Though there are no official numbers, a conservative estimate is that about 80,000 human beings are locked alonefor 22 hours or more each day in small, often windowless cells, isolated from any human contact (with the exception of very limited contact with prison staff), with no access to classes, job training, drug treatment, work or any other kind of rehabilitative programming. The mentally ill, disproportionately represented in solitary confinement, often become even more desperately ill, sometimes engaging in self-mutilation or even suicide. Even some healthy prisoners begin to exhibit symptoms of mental illness after a short time in solitary. Thousands of youth are also locked away in this manner each day, in both adult and juvenile facilities.\nThe use of solitary confinement in the U.S. is an urgent and pervasive problem deserving of the world stage and worldwide condemnation. The U.S. should implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, but greater global attention and action will be needed to ensure this nation’s use of solitary confinement is consistent with international human rights standards.\nLearn more about solitary confinement: Sign up for breaking news alerts, follow us on Twitter, and like us on Facebook.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, solitary confinement violates various human rights.

This reality didn’t just inform their thinking; it informed their living. Their theology invaded every aspect of African American identity.\nWhen Protten traveled the rough roads of the island of Antigua, her life would be the catalyst for the life of Sojourner Truth, the slave woman turned evangelist champion for the end of slavery. When Allen decided to walk out of the dark clouds of segregation and into the sunshine of racial justice, his life would be a catalyst for the young Martin Luther King Jr. who would do the same. When Lee had the courage to stand up and proclaim God’s truth despite being a woman, her life would be a catalyst for the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, who would always say, “You have to step out and trust God.” They gave birth to what we know as black Christianity today.\nThis strong tradition gave a people hope that God would act to provide justice for enslaved Africans and all who were oppressed. It was this faith that gave African Americans the arguments against the religion of the slaveholders. It gave a people a profound sense of dignity, identity, and significance, which led the church to be the most enduring and shaping institution in the African American story.\nAuthor Juan Williams writes that “individual black people took on a cloak of faith, an unshakable belief that God would carry them through slavery and lift them up to freedom.” They transformed themselves into “Christian soldiers, marching for an end to segregation and for the promise of equality as God’s children … then they transformed the church.” Much more, they transformed Christianity as we know it. It would do us well to not only listen to these stories of the past and be transformed by them in the present. May God make it so.\nDante Stewart is a student at Reformed Theological Seminary.

Author Juan Williams argues indeed it can be. In his book on African American religious history, This Far By Faith, Williams writes, “Africans did not simply adopt the religion of the European Colonist; they used the power, principles, and practices of Christianity to blaze a path to freedom and deliverance.” Not only did they blaze a path but the path was so big that he concludes that “it reformed Christian theology” as well as Christianity itself.\nRebecca Protten, ‘Mother of the Black Reformation’\nThough the process had long begun, in the 1730s, the birth of one of the earliest African Protestant churches found pivotal momentum in a seemingly unlikely place: the rugged roads through the hills of St. Thomas, a Danish sugar colony in the West Indies, known to the enslaved as “The Path.” Though kept from popular nightly meetings due to violent animosity, black men and women would press their way along these rugged roads to hear the gospel from an unlikely missionary: a brave young woman. She would not be just the “Mother of Modern Missions” but also the “Mother of the Black Reformation.” Her name was Rebecca Protten.\nBorn a slave in 1718 and kidnapped at an early age from the island of Antigua, she was converted as a young woman. Protten would eventually gain her freedom and join a group of German missionaries from the Moravian Church in 1736. Freidrich Martin, a Moravian missionary, wrote that Protten had done “the work of the Savior by teaching … and speaking.” Protten didn’t just give her voice to the mission of God; she gave her life. Jon Sensbach notes in his book Rebecca’s Revival that she would trudge “daily along rugged roads through the hills in the sultry evenings after the slaves had returned from the fields.”\nShe was more than a teacher; she was a mentor. She was “a prophet, determined to take what she regarded as the Bible’s liberating grace to people of African descent.” She took her message near and far by carrying it directly to the people. Her travels “took her to the slave quarters deep in the island’s plantation heartland, where she proclaimed salvation to the domestic servants, cane boilers, weavers, and cotton pickers whose bodies and spirits were strip-mined every day by slavery.”\nAs she and others took the gospel from plantation to plantation “St. Thomas suddenly became the Americas’ new axis of Afro-Protestant conversion.” Fueled by the message of liberating grace, they put “themselves at the forefront of an indigenous black movement that was birthed in the slave quarters.”\nSensbach concludes, “much that we associate with the black church in subsequent centuries—the anchor of community life, advocate for social justice, midwife to spirituals and gospel music—in some measure derives … from those early origins.” This Reformation spirit found its home in two women and two men.\nFreedom’s Prophet: Richard Allen and The Black Reformation\n“If I could write but a part of my labors, it would fill a volume.”\nThese were the words of Bishop Richard Allen in his spiritual autobiography Life, Experiences, and Gospel Labors.\nBorn into slavery in 1760, Richard Allen went on to become a leading American reformer, wrote many pamphlets of protest that would be the model for many generations to come. A pastor who was a contemporary of Allen’s called him one of the most “talented people of his generation.” Another dubbed him “The Apostle of Freedom.” Allen’s other contemporaries agreed. His life would be celebrated and would inspire the likes of the pioneering abolitionist Frederick Douglass, famed abolitionist David Walker, and great sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois.\nAt the age of 17, Allen “got religion” and converted to Methodism. His passion was undeniable. He would begin and end each day with prayer. Allen believed he had an important place in God’s mission. As one biographer shares, “The Lord looked for young Richard Allen, a slave, and Allen professed to be the Lord’s undying servant.” Allen joined St.\nDoc 5(Title: \"The history and importance of the Black Church – Harvard ...\") How the Black Church saved Black America\nHenry Louis Gates’ new book traces the institution’s role in history, politics, and culture\nExcerpted from “The Black Church: This is Our Story, This is Our Song” by Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Penguin Press)\nPolitical activists — including Malcolm X, of course, but especially the Black Panther Party in the latter half of the 1960s — have debated whether the role of the Black embrace of Christianity under slavery was a positive or negative force. There were those who argued that the Black Church was an example of Karl Marx’s famous indictment of religion as “the opium of the people” because it gave to the oppressed false comfort and hope, obscuring the causes of their oppression and reducing their urge to overturn that oppression. But I do not believe that religion functioned in this simple fashion in the history of Black people in this country.\nAs a matter of fact, although Marx was no fan of religion, to put it mildly, this statement, which the Panthers loved to quote, was part of a more complicated assessment of the nature and function of religion. The full quote bears repeating: “Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.” Marx could not imagine the complexity of the Black Church, even if the Black Church could imagine him — could imagine those who lacked the tools to see beyond its surface levels of meaning. James Weldon Johnson, in his lovely poem about the anonymous authors of the sacred vernacular tradition, “O Black and Unknown Bards,” put this failure of interpretive reciprocity in this memorable way:\nWhat merely living clod, what captive thing,\nCould up toward God through all its darkness grope,\nAnd find within its deadened heart to sing\nThese songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?\nHow did it catch that subtle undertone,\nThat note in music heard not with the ears?\nThe role of Black Christianity in motivating our country’s largest slave rebellion, Nat Turner’s rebellion, Southampton County, Va., is only the most dramatic example of the text of the King James Bible being called upon to justify the violent revolutionary overthrow of the slave regime. But we need only look at the brilliant use of the church in all of its forms — from W. E. B. Du Bois’s triptych of “the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy” to the use of the building itself — to see the revolutionary potential and practice of Black Christianity in forging social change. What most intrigues me about Marx’s full quote is his realization that it is at once “the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering,” a crucial part of the quote that seems to have fallen away.\nPeople, of course, pray and worship for all sorts of reasons. Despite what Marx and the Black Panthers thought, the importance of the role of the Black Church at its best cannot be gainsaid in the history of the African American people. Nor can it be underestimated. It isn’t religion that keeps human beings enslaved; it is violence. Most normal human beings don’t need an elaborate religious belief system to resist the temptation to sacrifice their lives in the face of overwhelming odds and the certainty that they will be brutally suppressed and killed. That would be unreasonable.\nThe “failure” of African Americans to overthrow their masters, as the enslaved men and women did on the island that became the Republic of Haiti, can’t be traced to the role of the church per se, as Nat Turner’s decision to act based on his interpretation of prophecy attests.

This reality didn’t just inform their thinking; it informed their living. Their theology invaded every aspect of African American identity.\nWhen Protten traveled the rough roads of the island of Antigua, her life would be the catalyst for the life of Sojourner Truth, the slave woman turned evangelist champion for the end of slavery. When Allen decided to walk out of the dark clouds of segregation and into the sunshine of racial justice, his life would be a catalyst for the young Martin Luther King Jr. who would do the same. When Lee had the courage to stand up and proclaim God’s truth despite being a woman, her life would be a catalyst for the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, who would always say, “You have to step out and trust God.” They gave birth to what we know as black Christianity today.\nThis strong tradition gave a people hope that God would act to provide justice for enslaved Africans and all who were oppressed. It was this faith that gave African Americans the arguments against the religion of the slaveholders. It gave a people a profound sense of dignity, identity, and significance, which led the church to be the most enduring and shaping institution in the African American story.\nAuthor Juan Williams writes that “individual black people took on a cloak of faith, an unshakable belief that God would carry them through slavery and lift them up to freedom.” They transformed themselves into “Christian soldiers, marching for an end to segregation and for the promise of equality as God’s children … then they transformed the church.” Much more, they transformed Christianity as we know it. It would do us well to not only listen to these stories of the past and be transformed by them in the present. May God make it so.\nDante Stewart is a student at Reformed Theological Seminary.

The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924. The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident within the boundaries of the United States.\nPost–World War II\n[edit]World War II was ultimately a victory for democracy in Western Europe, where representative governments were established that reflected the general will of their citizens. However, many countries of Central and Eastern Europe became undemocratic Soviet satellite states. In Southern Europe, a number of right-wing authoritarian dictatorships (most notably in Spain and Portugal) continued to exist.\nJapan had moved towards democracy during the Taishō period during the 1920s, but it was under effective military rule in the years before and during World War II. The country adopted a new constitution during the postwar Allied occupation, with initial elections in 1946.\nDecolonisation and civil rights movements\n[edit]World War II also planted seeds of democracy outside Europe and Japan, as it weakened, with the exception of the USSR and the United States, all the old colonial powers while strengthening anticolonial sentiment worldwide. Many restive colonies/possessions were promised subsequent independence in exchange for their support for embattled colonial powers during the war.\nIn 1946, the United States granted independence to the Philippines, which preserved a democratic political system as a presidential republic until the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos.\nThe aftermath of World War II also resulted in the United Nations' decision to partition the British Mandate into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. On 14 May 1948 the state of Israel declared independence and thus was born the first full democracy in the Middle East. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system and universal suffrage.[139][140]\nIndia became a democratic republic in 1950 after achieving independence from Great Britain in 1947. After holding its first national elections in 1952, India achieved the status of the world's largest liberal democracy with universal suffrage which it continues to hold today. Most of the former British and French colonies were independent by 1965 and at least initially democratic; those that were formerly part of the British Empire often adopted the Westminster parliamentary system.[141][iv] The process of decolonisation created much political upheaval in Africa and parts of Asia, with some countries experiencing often rapid changes to and from democratic and other forms of government.\nIn the United States of America, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act enforced the 15th Amendment. The 24th Amendment ended poll taxing by removing all tax placed upon voting, which was a technique commonly used to restrict the African American vote. The Voting Rights Act also granted voting rights to all Native Americans, irrespective of their home state. The minimum voting age was reduced to 18 by the 26th Amendment in 1971.\nLate Cold War and post-Soviet democratication\n[edit]New waves of democracy swept across Southern Europe in the 1970s, as a number of right-wing nationalist dictatorships fell from power. Later, in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the communist states in the USSR sphere of influence were also replaced with liberal democracies.\nMuch of Eastern Europe, Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, and several Arab, central Asian and African states, and the not-yet-state that is the Palestinian Authority moved towards greater liberal democracy in the 1990s and 2000s.\nBy the end of the century, the world had changed from having in 1900 not a single liberal democracy with universal suffrage, to 120 of the world's 192 nations, or 62% having become such democracies. 25 nations, or 13% of the world's nations had \"restricted democratic\nDoc 3(Title: \"How to Leverage Community Assets for Powerful Learning ...\") their culture, is that things began to stabilize.

A gentleman by the name of Randy was a canoe maker. And, they would do canoe journeys and teach the youth how to build canoes in the off-hours. Randy was also an accountant who had good math skills. As he got to know the youth and develop the relational piece, he understood that a lot of them were struggling with math.\nHe incorporated the teachings of the canoe and his knowledge of math and began tutoring these students. And, we saw the commensurate rise in academic achievement through this pathway and that was really the genesis point.\nWhat germinated out of that became after school supports and cultural practices, and customs to tutoring were then formally adopted by community-based organizations (CBO) that were operated and led by the community. And, these eventually morphed into formalized educational school settings.\n[00:16:05] Kelly Young: Josh [Schachter], I would love for you to share about ecosystems and what is necessary to create a learning ecosystem.\n[00:16:38] Josh Schachter: When you don’t have an ecosystem, essentially what it means is you’re in isolation from each other as many of us are experiencing right now with COVID and other things. When I was teaching photography to refugee and immigrant youth, the first semester I asked the students to photograph what it means to have a home, or to feel at home, or to come from a different home.\nOver a semester, they wrote and they photographed, and almost every image they came back with was of isolation and disconnection from their community (48 out of 50 students photographed that). And, thinking that the prompt was, “what does it mean to have a home.” and that was the response—isolation and disconnection—was deeply disturbing to my colleague and I.\nWhat we decided was to really shift our focus, to look at the passions and the projects our students wanted to focus on and match them with the community members who also share that passion. For me, really thinking [about learning] as an ecosystem is looking at how we build relationships. Ecosystems are about living relationships and looking at how you see the potential in relationships that exist or the ones that aren’t equally accessible in an ecosystem.\nTo speak to the role of the community, we invited our city council member to see the photos because she needed to understand her own constituents. And, she was so moved. She said, “Let’s have an exhibit of their work in my office.” And, we partnered to create an exhibit and then she said, “You know what, let’s make a book.”\nSo, we made a book of their photos, and then our Congressman got invited to the exhibit in Tucson and he said, “These are pretty powerful images that speak to what’s happening in our society, but Tucson isn’t the place. This needs to be seen. It needs to go to D.C.” Then, we partnered with Senator McCain’s Office and worked with other organizations that brought it to the United States Senate. Then, our students went out and testified in the U.S. House of Representatives about re-imagining refugee and immigration policy.\nThat [all] started with a relatively simple question about what it means to have a home and what is the ecosystem that exists in that home that is either invisible or inaccessible. And then, how do you reveal and connect those in ways that are equitable to all teachers and students in that community? That’s what it enabled for our students and for me, as a learner, to learn.

The idea that North American Indians had a democratic culture is several decades old, but not usually expressed within historical literature. The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by Benjamin Franklin and a speech by the Iroquois chief Canassatego in 1744. Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of a confederation, and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that eighteenth century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance.[114]\nWhat little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council, and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary. The council itself did not practice representative government, and there were no elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the clan. Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous, with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe. Tooker concludes that \"...there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois\" and that the myth is largely based on a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer J.N.B. Hewitt which was exaggerated and misinterpreted after his death in 1937.[114] [undue weight? – discuss]\nThe Aztecs also practiced elections, but the elected officials elected a supreme speaker, not a ruler.[113] However, a contemporary civilisation, Tlaxcallan, along with other Mesoamerican city states, are likely to have practiced collective rule.[115]\nRise of democracy in modern national governments\n[edit]Early Modern Era milestones\n[edit]- Golden Liberty or the Nobles' Democracy (Rzeczpospolita Szlachecka) arose in the Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This foreshadowed a democracy of about ten percent of the population of the Commonwealth, consisting of the nobility, who were an electorate for the office of the King.[116] They observed Nihil novi of 1505, Pacta conventa and King Henry's Articles (1573).

Although we have devoted considerable attention to the societal contexts of development in this period, including the social structures that shape and constrain the course of individual growth, of primary concern in our deliberations have been the implications for individual children—in particular, long-term individual outcomes of development.\nIn our view, developmental change is continuous and any segmentation into age periods is somewhat arbitrary. The widespread cultural demarcation of a period roughly corresponding to ages 6-12 raises important questions about the characteristics of children in this age group and, equally significant, the implications of segregation along these age boundaries for the developmental tasks, limitations, and possibilities encountered by individual children. The period is clearly not a static one developmentally, despite what has sometimes seemed to be a lack of concern among scholars about the significance of changes in middle childhood. We have viewed the middle childhood years as part of a continuous process as well as a period characterized by distinct abilities and age-related changes. Two questions recur in the chapters that follow:\n- 1.\nWhat is known about characteristics that distinguish children in middle childhood from those in the preschool years?\n- 2.\nWhat significant developmental changes ordinarily occur within these years?\nDuring middle childhood, children gain access to new settings and encounter pressures that present them with distinctive developmental challenges. The widening world of middle childhood is marked especially by the entry into school of children from all strata of U.S. society. School entry signifies a new set of social contacts with both adults and other children as well as a wider variety of settings than those that characterize early childhood. Consequently, school experiences and influences were central considerations in the panel's deliberations, as was the role of peers both in and out of school. The implications of a widening social world for family relationships—and their continuing functions for children in middle childhood—also occupied a primary role in our discussions. Fundamental to the topics we have chosen is the problem of characterizing the environmental constraints and options for children in diverse settings across the society.\nThe developmental difficulties and subsequent dysfunctions associated with children ages 6-12 also were major issues in the panel's deliberations. Although a detailed assessment of evidence on problem behaviors such as delinquency, drug use, runaways, and the like could not be undertaken within the scope of the panel's work, we did address both psychological and physical health in middle childhood—in particular, what is known and what needs to be known about the long-term implications of development for physical and mental health.\nIn this introductory chapter we first outline some of the important theoretical views that have shaped research in middle childhood. We present a group portrait of children in middle childhood in this country in order to give a demographic and social context to the research that is covered in the remainder of the volume. Finally, we give a brief overview of each of the topics covered in the individual chapters.\nTheoretical Views of Middle Childhood\nThe body of research concerned with children ages 6-12 encompasses disciplines ranging from psychology and sociology to medicine and public health. Surprisingly, few theoretical formulations have included extensive treatments of this age group, in contrast to the amount of theoretical attention given to infancy, early childhood, and adolescence.

Culture is a broad term that is used to refer to the set customs and values that a group of people have to abide by. It is these attitudes that shape the behavior modes of the people in the different culture creating rules and ways of conduct in sexual relationships and sexual behavior. There is huge interplay between the sexuality and the cultural believes that hold a set of people together. It is not possible to separate these two variables based on the fact that the cultural norms have bred a new behavior in the group of people. The nature of the cultures also affects the sexual contacts that are established in the cultures. It is imperative to note that collectivist cultures are bond to have more strict rules on sexual relations in contrast to the individualist society (Agner, 1999).\nDifferences of the Sexual Attitudes and Behavior of Two Cultures:\nThe selected cultures in this case scenario are the; American and African cultures. There are diverse characteristics that mark the two cultures. The American culture which is an individualist culture does not embrace the value of close social relations.

However, there are significant unanswered questions about how much change there has been among specific generations, beginning during the so-called “sexual revolution” by the post-World War II “Baby Boomers” in the 1960s and 1970s, and how much further these transformations may have been extended by GenX’ers (born 1965-1981) and Millennials (born 1982-1989). It may seem obvious that, relative to the 1950s, attitudes have shifted on issues such as premarital sex, same-sex relationships and casual sex — embodied by the media focus on “hook up” culture among Millennials — but the nature of these changes is nuanced and demands careful attention. Some research studies have suggested that these changes have been exaggerated and that there have even been reversals in practices and attitudes.\nIn a 2015 paper published in Archives of Sexual Behavior, “Changes in American Adults’ Sexual Behavior and Attitudes, 1972–2012,” Jean M. Twenge of San Diego State University, Ryne A. Sherman of Florida Atlantic University and Brooke E. Wells of CUNY review the complex research literature on these questions and analyze data from the nationally representative General Social Survey (GSS), a research project that provides perhaps the most complete record of public opinion shifts in the United States on many issues. The GSS has asked the same four questions relating to sexual attitudes since 1972, and added more questions about sexual practices in 1988. The researchers note that “the current research literature provides contradictory evidence on whether sexual attitudes and behaviors have grown more or less permissive in recent years.”\nThe study’s findings include:\n- The data indicate increasingly permissive attitudes about certain kinds of sexual behavior: “Between the 1970s and the 2010s, American adults became more accepting of premarital sex, adolescent sex, and same-sex sexual activity, but less accepting of extramarital sex…. After leveling off in the 1990s, acceptance of premarital sex continued to rise in the 2000s and 2010s.” However, these changes are more pronounced among some subgroups (white men) and less so among racial minorities and, at least on some measures, women in general.\n- The trendlines are relatively clear with respect to premarital sex: “In the early 1970s, 29% of Americans (35% of men and 23% of women) believed that premarital sex was ‘not wrong at all.’ This rose to around 42%in the 1980s and stayed there through the 1990s, rising to 49% in the 2000s and to 55% in the 2010s (59% of men, 52% of women)…. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 47% of Boomers in the early 1970s believed premarital sex was ‘not wrong at all,’ compared to 50% of GenX’ers in the early 1990s and 62% of Millennials in the 2010s.”\n- With regard to same-sex relationships and practices, younger generations have shown decisive changes: “Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 21% of Boomers in the early 1970s believed same-sex sexual activity was ‘not wrong at all,’ compared to 26% of GenX’ers in the early 1990s and 56% of Millennials in the 2010s.”\n- The number of sexual partners people reported having has increased: The “total number of sexual partners since age 18 increased from 7.17 in the late 1980s (11.42 for men, 3.54 for women) to 11.22 in the 2010s (18.22 for men, 5.55 for women).”\n- Rates of casual sex have also increased: “Among 18- to 29-year-olds reporting non-partner sex, 35% of GenX’ers in the late 1980s had sex with a casual date or pickup (44% of men, 19% of women), compared to 45% of Millennials in the 2010s (55% of men, 31% of women).”\n- African-Americans as a group, however, were a notable exception to these trends, and “shifts in sexual attitudes and behaviors were nearly absent” among this group.\n- The researchers note other important contextual data for these figures: The “median age at\nDoc 4(Title: \"Making up our minds: attitudes towards sex are changing\") Population-wide studies about attitudes towards sex can give us an insight into how our changing attitudes as a society may support efforts for social change. For example, increasing support for gay marriage reflects the way that attitudes towards same-sex sexual activity are changing over time.\nAn article published last month in the Archives of Sexual Behavior looked at changes in sexual attitudes between 1972 and 2012 using data from the nationally representative General Social Survey of US adults. By separating out the effects of time period, age and generation they were able to show how attitudes have changed - and that the change is mostly due to generational shifts. So - while young people’s attitudes may differ from their parents, the point is that their attitudes remain different over time, making the new generation different from the older generation even as they age. Take for example, acceptance of premarital sex. In the early 1970s premarital sex was accepted by 29% rising to 58% in the period between 2010 and 2012. Attitudes towards sexual activity among two adults of the same sex also changed: accepted by less than 20% before 1993 rising to 44% in 2012 (35% for men; 51% for women) and 56% for the generation born after 1982.\nHowever, while attitudes towards premarital sex and same-sex activity are becoming more accepting, attitudes towards extramarital sex and early teen sex are not becoming more permissive in the same way.\nWe cannot simply say that “attitudes are becoming more permissive”. Rather, it seems we are becoming more sophisticated in our collective attitude to sex. We seem to be less worried about the behaviour of consenting adults, but continue to be concerned about situations that may involve deception (as in the case of extramarital sex) or where the participants are under the age of consent (as in the case of early teen sex).\nThese patterns of changing attitudes are not confined to the US. Similar patterns of changes over time in sexual attitudes are evident in both Australia and Britain.\nThe Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships surveyed over 20,000 Australians aged 16-69 about their sexual attitudes and behaviour. Most (87%) agreed that premarital sex was acceptable and that an affair while in a committed relationship was unacceptable (83%). A comparison of these findings with the first Australian Study of Health and Relationships conducted 10 years earlier shows that we now have more permissive attitudes towards premarital and same-sex activity, and less tolerance of sex outside a committed relationship.\nSimilarly in Britain, the three National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles which have taken place since 1990 have shown that attitudes have changed in the same way, with acceptance of same-sex partnerships and intolerance towards those who have extra-marital affairs increasing over time.\nThese studies across the populations of the US, UK and Australia give us a broad snapshot of how attitudes towards sex are changing over time. As individuals we will always have diverse opinions based on myriad factors including our beliefs, our experiences and aspirations. As a collective group of individuals making up society (and making up our minds) our attitudes are changing and will drive social change accordingly.\nDoc 5(Title: \"Changes in Americans' attitudes about sex: Reviewing 40 ...\") n the 2010s (55% of men, 31% of women).”\n- African-Americans as a group, however, were a notable exception to these trends, and “shifts in sexual attitudes and behaviors were nearly absent” among this group.\n- The researchers note other important contextual data for these figures: The “median age at first marriage has risen markedly; it was 21 for women and 23 for men in 1970, and by 2010 was 27 for women and 29 for men. The marriage rate in the U.S. reached a 93-year low in 2014…. Marriage is also increasingly disconnected from parenting: More than 40% of babies were born to unmarried mothers in 2012, up from 5% in 1960.”\n“Overall, the results suggest that rising cultural individualism has produced an increasing rejection of traditional social rules, including those against non-marital sex,” the researchers conclude. These realities, they note, have public policy implications: “Generational changes in non-marital sexual attitudes and behaviors are particularly relevant as they influence policy decisions regarding sexual health and sexual education policies, such as decisions about emergency contraception and abortion availability and the debates around abstinence-only versus comprehensive sexual education.” Further, “these findings indicate that variability in sexual attitudes and norms according to generation, age, gender, and race/ethnicity should be considered in the development and implementation of sexual education and sexual health intervention programs.”\nKeywords: parenting, sexuality, marriage\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the documents, it is clear that attitudes about sexual aggression vary widely by culture and era due to differing cultural norms and societal changes.

But such services are not a guaranteed preventive measure. By treating suicide as a public health issue, we can increase mental health services, as well as other preventive measures that address the population as a whole.\nWho Is At Risk?\nMany factors contribute to suicide among people with and without known mental health conditions. Generally speaking, the more risk factors an individual has, the higher their risk.\nApproximately 1 in 5 adults experiences mental illness in a given year. (5) Though not all people who die by suicide were previously diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, there is a link between suicide and mental illness. (5)\nDepression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and substance abuse disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior.\nWhen someone is experiencing a depressive episode, a combination of biological and psychological factors may cause feelings of helplessness that make it difficult to envision a more positive past or future.\nResearch shows that alcohol use disorder is one of the strongest predictors of suicide. People with substance use disorders are about 6 times more likely to attempt suicide than the general population. (6) Older individuals with an addiction, individuals with both an addiction and a history of previous suicide attempts, heroin users, and those who abuse sedatives are at higher risk within the addiction population. (6)\nA family history of suicide increases one’s odds of dying by suicide. (7)\nChildhood trauma and abuse can be a predictor of suicidal thoughts. A 2017 study, for example, found a significant link between childhood sexual abuse and suicidal ideation in adults. (8)\nOther factors associated with suicide include: (7)\n- Relationship problems\n- Problematic substance use\n- Physical health issues or serious illnesses\n- Job and financial problems\n- Difficulty accessing healthcare\n- Criminal or legal problems\n- Unsafe media depictions of suicide\nYoung people are especially at risk for suicidal thoughts and behavior. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 14 and 25 and 34, and it’s the third-leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. (1)\nIf a child or adolescent has a number of risk factors, it’s imperative to get treatment early. Suicide can often be prevented if proper supports are quickly put in place. Among the risk factors that can affect young people: (9)\n- A recent or serious loss, such as the death of a family member, friend, or pet\n- A relationship breakup, the separation or divorce of parents, loss of a home, or financial problems affecting a family\n- A psychiatric disorder, particularly depression or a traumatic-stress related disorder\n- Previous suicide attempts\n- Alcohol and other substance abuse disorders and other high-risk behaviors\n- Family history of suicide\n- Access to lethal means such as a firearm\n- History of trauma such as physical or sexual abuse\n- Social isolation or a lack of social support\nStruggling with sexual orientation in an environment that isn’t supportive is an additional risk factor for suicide among youth. LGBTQ+ youth are more than 4 times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers. Additionally, 36 percent of LGBTQ+ youth reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed, and those who reported this attempted suicide at nearly triple the rate of those who did not in the past year. (10)\nBetween 2007 and 2017, the rate of suicide among Black youth increased faster than that of any other racial or ethnic group. (11) A report from the Congressional Black Caucus Emergency Task Force on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health states that Black youth under age 13 are 2 times as likely to die by suicide as their white peers. (11) Along with traditional risk factors, Black youth face additional risk factors, such as strain associated with racism and dis\nDoc 2(Title: \"Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors Prevention and How to Get Help\") Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors, Prevention, and How to Get Help\nSuicide is among the top nine leading causes of death in the United States for people ages 10 to 64. (1) It’s a complex problem with significant economic and human costs to individuals, families, and communities, and it’s a public health crisis.\nSuicide rates rose by nearly 33 percent between 1999 and 2019, with small decreases observed in 2019 and 2020. (1)\nWhile certain mental health conditions raise the risk of suicide, the desire to end one’s life is rarely caused by any one thing. And while there are risk factors that can help identify people in need of extra support, and sometimes there are warning signs, all too often suicide seems to come out of nowhere. One reason is that diagnosing suicide risk isn’t as simple as performing a wellness check. And the red flags, if there are any at all, can be very subtle.\nRELATED: Download the ‘Surviving the Suicide of a Loved One’ Companion PDF\nDefining the Problem\nWhile most people understand the term “suicide” to mean voluntarily taking one’s own life, the decision to stop living is one that people arrive at in many different ways. To increase understanding of what counts as suicidal behavior and to avoid confusion when discussing an individual’s self-harming behaviors, the following terminology is recommended: (2)\n- Self-Directed Violence Behavior directed at oneself that deliberately results in injury, or potential injury, to oneself.\n- Nonsuicidal Self-Directed Violence This includes behavior that is self-directed and intended to cause injury, or has the potential to cause injury but for which there is no evidence, implicit or explicit, of suicidal intent.\n- Suicidal Self-Directed Violence This includes behavior that is self-directed and intended to cause injury, or has the potential to cause injury with evidence, implicit or explicit, of suicidal intent.\n- Undetermined Self-Directed Violence Behavior that is self-directed and intended to cause injury to oneself, but evidence of suicidal intent is unclear.\n- Suicide Attempt This is a nonfatal self-directed injurious behavior with an attempt to die. A suicide attempt does not always lead to death.\n- Interrupted Self-Directed Violence A person takes steps to injure themself, but stops or is stopped by another person.\nSome people may not have attempted self-directed violence but think about doing so. This is called suicidal thought or ideation. Suicidal thoughts can be: (3)\n- Passive A person has thoughts of death but no desire or plan to harm themselves. This often looks like thoughts about one’s own death, thoughts that one would be better off dead, indifference about life, or a passive wish to die, like wanting to sleep forever or wishing for a disease or accident. Although passive suicidal ideation may not be imminently dangerous, it can still be harmful over time, as it could lead to reckless behavior or progress to more active thoughts of suicide.\n- Active A person has suicidal thoughts and at least some kind of plan to act on them. Active suicidal thoughts exist on a spectrum, and can range from wanting to end one’s own life to coming up with ideas about how to do this and forming an actual plan.\nSuicide Discussion\nPrevalence in the U.S.\nMore than 45,979 Americans died by suicide in 2020 — the most recent year for which data is available. (1) In the same year, men died by suicide 3.88 times as often as women, and white men accounted for more than 69 percent of suicide deaths. (4)\nDespite increased awareness and prevention efforts, suicide rates remain high. It’s recommended that high-risk people who verbalize suicidal thinking, make attempts, or are in a crisis that may lead to suicidal behavior receive mental health services. But such services are not a guaranteed preventive measure. By treating suicide as a public health issue, we can increase mental health services, as well as other preventive measures that address the population as a whole.\nWho Is At Ri\nDoc 3(Title: \"Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors Prevention and How to Get Help\") n shows that a person is struggling and needs to get help quickly.\nPrevention and Intervention\nFrom a public health perspective, comprehensive programs in the community, in school systems, and in the workplace play an important role in educating people about suicide and preventing suicide.\nAccessible and affordable treatment for all age groups improves the likelihood that people will seek help when they need it.\nWhen people have a better understanding of the risk factors and warning signs and they have access to services, they are more likely to reach out for help for themselves or others.\nOn an individual level, open communication about suicide and mental health, as well as unconditional support, are essential steps to keeping a friend or loved one safe. If you sense that someone is at risk, follow these steps.\nAsk Specific Questions\nAsking if someone is thinking of ending their own life does not increase the likelihood that they will attempt suicide. In fact, direct communication relieves the burden of hiding complex emotions out of fear of judgment or stigma. It can provide a feeling of relief from isolation.\nBe direct and listen carefully to the answers. Your friend or loved one needs to feel heard and understood. Try starting the conversation with questions like these:\n- “Are you having thoughts of suicide?”\n- “Have you had thoughts of suicide in the past?”\n- “When did you begin feeling this way?”\n- “How can I help you through this difficult time?”\n- “Have you considered getting help? What steps have you taken to get help?”\nProvide Support\nIt’s important to listen without judgment and convey empathy. You might not know exactly how your loved one is feeling, but you can understand that they need a listening ear, emotional support, and warmth during a difficult time.\nAvoid statements like “You have so much to live for!” or “How can you possibly be thinking of this?” Remarks like these can trigger feelings of shame and cause further isolation.\nCreate a Help Plan\nIt can be difficult for people experiencing suicidal thoughts to connect to mental health professionals and services on their own.\nOne way you can help is to gather a list of resources for treatment, such as the names of licensed psychotherapists or psychiatrists, as well as other services that can assist with personal care needs and with getting to and from appointments.\nEnact a Safety Plan\nIf you think that your friend or loved one is showing signs of imminent danger, even if you’re not certain, take the following precautions:\n- Stay with the at-risk person until help arrives\n- Remove all lethal means\n- Take the person to the nearest hospital or call 911\nWhere Can You Get Help?\nThere are a number of resources to help people who are suicidal or show risk factors for suicide. The starting point depends on the risk level.\n- Help and chat lines: The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call 988) and the Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741) provide free and confidential support and assist individuals in crisis with local resources.\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy are both recommended treatments for people experiencing suicidal ideation.\n- Some people experiencing suicidal ideation need medication. A licensed psychiatrist (a child or adolescent psychiatrist for young people) can complete a full workup and prescribe medications.\n- Call 911 in the event of imminent risk.\n- To learn more about preventing suicide, visit the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website BeThe1To.com, which was created by the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\nSuicide is complex, but it is often preventable. If individuals and communities work together to increase awareness, educate one another, and mobilize local resources, they can help people who are experiencing suicidal thoughts get the help they need.\nResources We Love\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Frequently Asked Questions About Suicide\nThis resource discusses risk factors and warning signs for suicide, as\nDoc 4(Title: \"Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors Prevention and How to Get Help\") ck Caucus Emergency Task Force on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health states that Black youth under age 13 are 2 times as likely to die by suicide as their white peers.

(11)\nRELATED: Black Mental Health: Elevating Voices to Fight Stigma and Build Trust\nA study published in 2017 found a link between increased social media use among young adults and increased social isolation. While causation remains unclear, the study found that participants who spent more than two hours a day on social media had twice the odds of perceived social isolation than those who spent a half hour a day or less. (12)\nSocial media can be beneficial in bringing together people who might otherwise struggle, for a variety of reasons, to make daily connections. But it may become a risk factor if it’s used as a replacement for human relationships.\nWhat Is Suicide Contagion?\nSuicide contagion is a term used when the suicide of one person or multiple people triggers an increase in suicidal behavior among others. This can affect all people, at any age, but it is particularly concerning for people who already have suicidal thoughts, have made previous suicide attempts, or have other risk factors for suicide.\nA study published in 2018 found a nearly 10 percent increase in suicides following the suicide of the actor Robin Williams in 2014. Males and people between ages 30 and 44 showed the greatest increase during this time period. (13)\nWhen a celebrity dies by suicide, the media is flooded with articles and reports about the death. This can include sensationalized information and specific details. The coverage can trigger people who are already experiencing suicidal thoughts to identify with the celebrity.\nFor that reason, media, public health, and suicide prevention organizations have developed “Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide” to address concerns about suicide contagion and establish best practices for news coverage related to suicide. (14) These include avoiding oversimplifying or speculating on the reason for the suicide and not describing or depicting the method or the location where the death took place.\nSigns of Suicidal Behavior\nPeople are often cautioned to look for the “red flags” for suicidal behavior. It’s important to understand that not all people show warning signs, and the signs can be hard to detect. For instance, someone seriously contemplating suicide won’t necessarily say something direct like, “I’m thinking about killing myself.” Instead, they may say something indirect like, “You’ll be better off when I’m gone.”\nAt the same time, some people do engage in behaviors that suggest imminent danger. Get immediate help if someone is researching ways to commit suicide or gathering the lethal means to attempt suicide, such as guns or medications that can cause death at high doses. Putting one’s affairs in order or giving away prized possessions can also be signs of suicidal ideation.\nOther red flags to consider include: (9)\n- Communicating feelings of hopelessness\n- Talking about wanting to die\n- Talking about being a burden to others\n- Talking about feeling trapped\n- Talking about feeling unbearable pain\n- Increased substance abuse\n- Acting unusually anxious, agitated, or reckless\n- Significant mood swings\n- Increased anger or rage\n- Withdrawing or feeling isolated\n- Changes in sleep patterns (too much or too little)\nAny warning signs should be taken seriously in adults and children. Do not assume that someone who talks about feeling hopeless or wanting to die is simply seeking attention. Each warning sign shows that a person is struggling and needs to get help quickly.\nPrevention and Intervention\nFrom a public health perspective, comprehensive programs in the community, in school systems, and in the workplace play an important role in educating people about suicide and preventing suicide.\nAccessibl\nDoc 5(Title: \"Suicide | Mental Health Foundation\") This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, self-harm, depression, anxiety and substance abuse or addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use). Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page.\nSummary\n- What does it mean to be suicidal?\n- What can make someone want to end their life?\n- What can I do if I feel suicidal?\n- How can I help someone if I’m worried they’re suicidal?\n- Further information and resources\nIn the UK in 2019, 6524 people took their own lives. Men are three times more likely than women to die by suicide. Women are more likely to report suicidal thoughts.\nMen aged 45 to 49 and women aged 50 to 54 have the highest suicide rates in England and Wales.\nWhat does it mean to be suicidal?\nSuicidal feelings can be confusing, frightening and complicated. They can range from having general thoughts about not wanting to be here to make a plan about how and when you could end your life. You might feel less like you want to die and more that you want the pain to stop.\nYou might feel:\n- hopeless or trapped\n- tearful, anxious or overwhelmed by negative thoughts\n- desperate\n- tempted to do risky or reckless things because you don’t care what happens to you\n- like you want to avoid other people\nWhat can make someone want to end their life?\nSuicide is complex, and there is no single explanation of why people die by suicide. There are many different risk factors, including:\n- previous suicide attempts, or previous self-harm. Many people who self-harm don’t want to die. However, research shows that people who self-harm are at higher risk of attempting or dying by suicide\n- being unemployed\n- having a physical health problem, including chronic pain\n- living alone\n- being dependent on alcohol or drugs\n- having mental health problems\nThere may not be an obvious reason why someone feels suicidal. But whatever the cause, there is help available.\nWhat can I do if I feel suicidal?\nIf you have seriously harmed yourself or don’t feel that you can keep yourself safe right now, call 999 or go straight to A&E.\nIf you are experiencing suicidal thoughts and need support, you can:\n- call your GP and ask for an emergency appointment\n- call NHS 111 for out-of-hours help\n- contact your mental health crisis team if you have one\nOur crisis care page has more information on who can help.\nThere are many free helplines available.\n- Samaritans offer a support service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Call them free on 116 123. You can also email jo@samaritans.org\n- CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably) has a helpline (5 pm to midnight) and webchat for anyone who’s having a tough time and needs to talk.\n- Papyrus supports people under 35 who have thoughts of suicide and others who are concerned about them. You can call their HOPELINE247 on 0800 068 4141, text 07860 039967 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org . They’re open 24 hours a day.\nSamaritans have practical tips on dealing with suicidal feelings.\nHow can I help someone if I’m worried they’re suicidal?\nSimple actions can help support someone who is suicidal or recovering from an attempt to take their life.\nJust asking someone if they’re suicidal can help. Asking directly about suicide gives someone permission to open up and lets them know they’re not a burden. If someone feels suicidal, it can be a huge relief to talk about how they feel.\nIf a friend does share their suicidal feelings with you, it’s usually best to listen and respond with open questions rather than advice or opinions. You don’t have to solve their problems; offer support and encourage them to talk if you can.\nIt can feel difficult to start these conversations. Samaritans have tips on how to be a good listener. Mind also has information on supporting someone who feels suicidal.\nYour friend may also need help with practical things, such as calling their GP, contacting family and friends, or simply watching TV with them or doing an activity together. You could also help them\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, the key factors that affect the likelihood of suicide include:\n\n1. Mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and substance abuse disorders.\n2. Substance use disorders, especially alcohol use disorder.\n3.

Cognitive and physical milestones can help you track your child’s development and cognitive growth. For example, at six months old, a child should generally be able to roll from their stomach to their back and reach to grab the toys they want. Meanwhile, at nine months old, they will likely be able to move into a sitting position on their own and look for objects that drop out of sight. If you notice any potential delays, it can be best to speak to your child’s pediatrician to identify any potential underlying issues. Working with a therapist to develop effective parenting skills can also be helpful, and attending sessions online can make it easy to fit therapy into your schedule.\nWhat are developmental milestones?\nResearchers at the Centers for Disease Control generally define developmental milestones as the physical, mental, language, social, and emotional skills present in approximately 75% of children by a certain age.\nIt can be important to pay attention to how your child plays, learns new skills and information, speaks and understands language, and behaves with you and others for vital clues about their developmental progress.\nKey areas of physical and mental development during childhood\nCognitive development: How young children understand objects, take in sensory information, and engage with the world around them\nPhysical development: How your child moves their body, with large body movements like sitting and walking, and small body movements, such as control over their hands, reflexes, vision, sleeping, and eating\nLanguage development: How your child hears and understands sounds and uses speech to communicate\nSocial and emotional development: How your child interacts with and forms connections to the people who make regular appearances in their lives, such as parents, siblings, and grandparents, and how they react to strangers and places with new people\nTwo months: Rapid physical and cognitive growth\nDuring the first two months of their life, your child will likely learn, change, and grow by leaps and bounds. Children experience rapid physical and cognitive developmental milestones from birth to two months typically centering around developing basic senses, exploring their body parts and how they move, and learning about the world around them.\nPhysical development: Can hold their head up while on their stomach, move both arms and legs, and open their hands\nCognitive development: Watches you when you move and stares at toys or other objects for several seconds\nFour months: Developing perception\nMost babies at four months are developing their sense of perception. You may notice them reacting to familiar sounds and voices, recognizing faces they see frequently, and responding to others’ facial expressions with imitation.\nPhysical development: Can hold steady independently while being held, hold a toy when placed in their hand, use arms to swing at toys, bring hands to their mouth, and push up on their elbows while on their stomach\nCognitive development: Opens their mouth when seeing a breast or bottle if they’re hungry, stares at their hands with fascination\nSix months: Fantasy versus reality\nYour child at six months is likely full of wonder, often staring at objects that catch their interest. You may notice a developing ability to discern real things from fake ones, such as picking between a live animal and a stuffed toy.\nPhysical development: Rolls from their stomach to back, pushes up with straight arms from their tummy, and leans forward on hands for support while sitting\nCognitive development: Puts objects in their mouth, reaches to grab toys they want, and closes their mouth when they don’t want food\nNine months: Movement milestones\nMost babies at nine months old are expanding their movement abilities and trying to explore the world around them. They typically understand w\nDoc 2(Title: \"Childhood: Physical and Cognitive Development ...\") Learning Objectives\n- Explain the physical development that occurs from infancy through childhood\n- Explain the cognitive development that occurs from infancy through childhood\nPhysical Development\nIn infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, the body’s physical development is rapid (Figure 1). On average, newborns weigh between 5 and 10 pounds, and a newborn’s weight typically doubles in six months and triples in one year. By 2 years old the weight will have quadrupled, so we can expect that a 2 year old should weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The average length of a newborn is 19.5 inches, increasing to 29.5 inches by 12 months and 34.4 inches by 2 years old (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006).\nDuring infancy and childhood, growth does not occur at a steady rate (Carel, Lahlou, Roger, & Chaussain, 2004). Growth slows between 4 and 6 years old: During this time children gain 5–7 pounds and grow about 2–3 inches per year. Once girls reach 8–9 years old, their growth rate outpaces that of boys due to a pubertal growth spurt. This growth spurt continues until around 12 years old, coinciding with the start of the menstrual cycle. By 10 years old, the average girl weighs 88 pounds, and the average boy weighs 85 pounds.\nWe are born with all of the brain cells that we will ever have—about 100–200 billion neurons (nerve cells) whose function is to store and transmit information (Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 1997). However, the nervous system continues to grow and develop. Each neural pathway forms thousands of new connections during infancy and toddlerhood. This period of rapid neural growth is called blooming. Neural pathways continue to develop through puberty. The blooming period of neural growth is then followed by a period of pruning, where neural connections are reduced. It is thought that pruning causes the brain to function more efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Hutchinson, 2011). Blooming occurs during the first few years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in various areas of the brain.\nTry It\nThe size of our brains increases rapidly. For example, the brain of a 2-year-old is 55% of its adult size, and by 6 years old the brain is about 90% of its adult size (Tanner, 1978). During early childhood (ages 3–6), the frontal lobes grow rapidly. Recalling our discussion of the 4 lobes of the brain earlier in this book, the frontal lobes are associated with planning, reasoning, memory, and impulse control. Therefore, by the time children reach school age, they are developmentally capable of controlling their attention and behavior. Through the elementary school years, the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes all grow in size. The brain growth spurts experienced in childhood tend to follow Piaget’s sequence of cognitive development, so that significant changes in neural functioning account for cognitive advances (Kolb & Whishaw, 2009; Overman, Bachevalier, Turner, & Peuster, 1992).\nTry It\nMotor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (e.g., sucking and rooting) to more advanced motor functioning. For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to sit with assistance, and then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling and then walking.\nMotor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy, writing with a pencil, and using a spoon). Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping).\nAs motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve (Table 1). For each milestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages in which the milestone should be reached. An example of a developmental milesto\nDoc 3(Title: \"Introduction - Development During Middle Childhood - NCBI ...\") distinctive characteristics—physical, behavioral, social, and emotional—and development of children across the age span from 6 to 12. Although we have devoted considerable attention to the societal contexts of development in this period, including the social structures that shape and constrain the course of individual growth, of primary concern in our deliberations have been the implications for individual children—in particular, long-term individual outcomes of development.\nIn our view, developmental change is continuous and any segmentation into age periods is somewhat arbitrary. The widespread cultural demarcation of a period roughly corresponding to ages 6-12 raises important questions about the characteristics of children in this age group and, equally significant, the implications of segregation along these age boundaries for the developmental tasks, limitations, and possibilities encountered by individual children. The period is clearly not a static one developmentally, despite what has sometimes seemed to be a lack of concern among scholars about the significance of changes in middle childhood. We have viewed the middle childhood years as part of a continuous process as well as a period characterized by distinct abilities and age-related changes. Two questions recur in the chapters that follow:\n- 1.\nWhat is known about characteristics that distinguish children in middle childhood from those in the preschool years?\n- 2.\nWhat significant developmental changes ordinarily occur within these years?\nDuring middle childhood, children gain access to new settings and encounter pressures that present them with distinctive developmental challenges. The widening world of middle childhood is marked especially by the entry into school of children from all strata of U.S. society. School entry signifies a new set of social contacts with both adults and other children as well as a wider variety of settings than those that characterize early childhood. Consequently, school experiences and influences were central considerations in the panel's deliberations, as was the role of peers both in and out of school. The implications of a widening social world for family relationships—and their continuing functions for children in middle childhood—also occupied a primary role in our discussions. Fundamental to the topics we have chosen is the problem of characterizing the environmental constraints and options for children in diverse settings across the society.\nThe developmental difficulties and subsequent dysfunctions associated with children ages 6-12 also were major issues in the panel's deliberations. Although a detailed assessment of evidence on problem behaviors such as delinquency, drug use, runaways, and the like could not be undertaken within the scope of the panel's work, we did address both psychological and physical health in middle childhood—in particular, what is known and what needs to be known about the long-term implications of development for physical and mental health.\nIn this introductory chapter we first outline some of the important theoretical views that have shaped research in middle childhood. We present a group portrait of children in middle childhood in this country in order to give a demographic and social context to the research that is covered in the remainder of the volume. Finally, we give a brief overview of each of the topics covered in the individual chapters.\nTheoretical Views of Middle Childhood\nThe body of research concerned with children ages 6-12 encompasses disciplines ranging from psychology and sociology to medicine and public health. Surprisingly, few theoretical formulations have included extensive treatments of this age group, in contrast to the amount of theoretical attention given to infancy, early childhood, and adolescence. The two major views of the child between 6 and 12—those advanced by Sigmund Freud and Jean Piaget—focus on some possible reasons for the common belief in middle childhood as a\nDoc 4(Title: \"Cognitive And Physical Early Childhood Development ...\") e development: Puts objects in their mouth, reaches to grab toys they want, and closes their mouth when they don’t want food\nNine months: Movement milestones\nMost babies at nine months old are expanding their movement abilities and trying to explore the world around them. They typically understand when objects are gone, such as losing a bottle or snack.\nPhysical development: Can get to a sitting position by themselves, their motor development involves moving objects from one hand to the other, rake food with their fingers, and sit without support\nCognitive development: Looks for objects that drop out of sight and bangs two things together\nOne year: Learning communication\nAs they reach the one-year mark, your baby’s cognitive, social, and physical development usually speeds up, and you may notice them observing or imitating you and other adults. They may begin producing spoken language in the form of simple words or concepts.\nPhysical development: Can pull themselves up to stand, walk while holding on to furniture, drink from a cup without a lid that you hold, and pick up small objects between their thumb and pointer finger\nCognitive development: Can put something into a container and look for objects they see you hide\nFifteen months: Social development\nMost children can understand the difference between themselves and others by 15 months. You may notice that they can identify similar objects and imitate others’ actions or speech.\nPhysical development: Can take a few steps on their own and use their fingers to feed themselves food\nCognitive development: Tries to use objects for their correct function, such as cups or books, and can stack at least two small things, like blocks\n18 months: Play and physical exploration\nBy the time they are 18 months old, your baby may be actively learning through exploration and physical activity and frequently using their newfound mobility to see as much as possible. You may notice they can identify some objects in picture books, differentiate between “me” and “you,” and understand words enough to respond.\nPhysical development: Walks freely without support, scribbles, drinks from lidless cups with occasional spills, feeds themselves with their fingers, attempts to use a spoon, and can climb onto and off couches or chairs independently\nCognitive development: Can copy your movements during chores, like washing windows or sweeping, and engage in simple play with toys, such as babbling into a toy phone\nTwo years: A sense of independence\nBy the time they reach two years, your child will likely be developing a sense of independence. You may notice them begin to engage in pretend play. Much of their learning at this stage usually results from their experiences.\nPhysical development: Their motor skills have developed to being able to kick a ball, run, walk up a few stairs independently without climbing, and eat with a spoon\nCognitive development: Can hold something in one hand while using the other hand for another task, attempts to use buttons, knobs, or switches on toys, and frequently plays with more than one toy simultaneously\nMany children learn language structures and experience language acquisition to a more significant degree around the age of 24 months old. This subsequent language development is related to improving cognitive skills, which support language development.\n30 months: Continued exploration\nAt 30 months, your child may be becoming more independent and exploring their world. They may learn quickly and respond to simple directions from caregivers. You may notice they recognize their reflection and demonstrate increasing intelligence.\nPhysical development: Can use their hands to twist objects, such as doorknobs, remove some clothes independently, jump off the ground using both feet, and turn a single book page\nCognitive development: Often uses objects for pretend play, demonstrates problem-solving skills, can follow simple two-step instructions, and shows knowledge of at least one color\nDoc 5(Title: \"Physical Cognitive & Emotional Development during ...\") ADVERTISEMENTS:\nIn this article we will discuss about physical, cognitive, social and emotional development during adolescence.\nPhysical Development during Adolescence:\nThe beginning of adolescence is signaled by a sudden increase in the rate of physical growth. While this growth spurt occurs for both sexes, it starts earlier for girls (at about age ten or eleven) than for boys (about age twelve or thirteen). Before this spurt, boys and girls are similar in height; in its early phases, girls are often taller than boys; after it is over, males are several inches taller, on average, than females.\nThis growth spurt is just one aspect of puberty, the period of rapid change during which individuals of both genders reach sexual maturity. During puberty the gonads, or primary sex glands, produce increased levels of sex hormones, and the external sex organs assume their adult form. Girls begin to menstruate and boys start to produce sperm.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nIn addition, both sexes undergo many other shifts relating to sexual maturity. Boys develop facial and chest hair and their voices deepen. Girls’ breasts develop, and their hips widen; both sexes develop pubic hair.\nThere is great individual variability in all these respects. Most girls begin to menstruate by the time they are thirteen, but for some this process does not start until considerably later, and for others it may begin as early as age seven or eight. Most boys begin to produce sperm by the time they are fourteen or fifteen; but again, for some the process may start either earlier or a bit later.\nFacial features, too, often change during puberty. Characteristics associated with childhood, such as large eyes, a high forehead, round cheeks, and a small chin, give way to a more adult appearance.\nWe’ll examine, what makes people physically attractive, some members of both genders retain relatively childlike facial features; for females such “baby-faced” appearance can be a plus, because many males find it attractive. Being baby-faced does not confer such advantages on males, however. In fact, recent findings indicate that adolescent males who are baby-faced may attempt to compensate for this by behaving in antisocial ways (e.g., committing crimes).\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nGender differences also exist with respect to the effects of early sexual maturation. Early-maturing boys seem to have a definite edge over those who mature later. They are stronger and more athletic and often excel in competitive sports. Partly as a result of these advantages, they tend to be more self-assured and popular and are often chosen for leadership roles.\nIn contrast, early sexual maturation can have negative implications for females. Early-maturing girls are taller than their classmates frequently taller than boys their own age and their increased sexual attractiveness may invite unwanted sexual advances from older persons. In short, the timing of puberty can play an important role in adolescents’ developing self-identities and so in their later social development.\nCognitive Development during Adolescence:\nAdolescents become capable of logical thought. However, this does not mean that they necessarily demonstrate such thinking. In fact, only about 40 percent of adolescents can solve the kind of problems used by Piaget to test for formal operational thinking. Moreover, if they do show such logical thought, it may be restricted to topics or types of problems with which they have had direct experience.\nIn addition, adolescents’ theory of mind, their understanding of how they and others think continues to change and develop. Younger children take what has been described as a realist approach to knowledge; they believe that knowledge is a property of the real world and that there are definite facts or truths that can be acquired.\nIn contrast, older children and preadolescents become aware of the fact that experts often disagree; this leads them to develop a relativist approach, which recognizes that different pe\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the provided information, I can summarize:\n\nIn middle childhood (ages 6-12):\n- Physical development includes growth spurts, improved fine and gross motor skills, better coordination, and enhanced cognitive processing.\n- Cognitive development sees improvement in logical thinking, problem solving, and memory.\n\nFor adolescence:\n- Physical development involves rapid growth spurts, reaching sexual maturity, changes in facial features, and overall physical changes.\n- Cognitive development progresses towards logical reasoning, abstract thinking, and better understanding of others' perspectives.\n\n<answer> Physical development includes growth spurts, improved fine and gross motor skills, better coordination, and enhanced cognitive processing.

Reusable bags (such as cloth bags) are an alternative, and after 6-10 uses, you make up for the energy used to make it.[3] After your reusable bag is ineffectual, it can be given to the Grateful Thread.[4]Advertisement\n-\nLimit your energy use. Even when electronics are not in use, they still require energy, so shut down your computer(s) every night. It takes all of 5 seconds.[5]Jane Goodall, Conservation & Animal Welfare Advocate\nTake action in your own life to protect the environment. \"You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.\"\n-\nGrow your own food. Instead of waste ending up in landfills, they can be used to provide more food. Carrot tops (with the greens), garlic, green onions, and potatoes all work. Pineapples can be grown from tops as well, but require 2 years to produce fruit.[6]\n-\nEat locally. The fuel needed to transport food is a huge contributor to carbon emissions.[7] Local food is also more nutritious as it takes lesser time to reach your table.[8]\nCommunity Q&A\n-\nQuestionHow can the community help the environment?Community AnswerThe community can expand/improve public transportation so people are less likely to drive cars, pass laws regulating pollution, organize public relations campaigns asking people to conserve energy, plant trees and other types of plants, etc.\n-\nQuestionWhat are suggestions to improve the environment?Community AnswerThe major factors to improve the environment is cleanliness and afforestation.\n-\nQuestionHow can kids help improve the environment?Community AnswerYou can reduce, reuse and recycle.

One cause that has been popular in recent years is helping the environment and preserving our resources.\nThere are several ways that you – yes, YOU- can help protect this planet we call Earth.\nWhat you do makes a difference! Need proof?\nCalculate your environmental footprint to see how much impact just one person has on the world's resources, and adjust accordingly.\nHow Can You Be Environmentally Friendly?\nThere are small changes you can make to become more environmentally friendly, even as a student. Taking these steps will enable you to build a better future for yourself -- and the next generations. Follow these steps to start becoming more environmentally friendly right away.\nUse Reusable Bags\nPlastic grocery bags that get thrown out end up in landfills or in other parts of the environment. These can suffocate animals who get stuck in them or may mistake them for food. Also, it takes a while for the bags to decompose.\nWhether you are shopping for food, clothes, or books, use a reusable bag. This cuts down on litter and prevents animals from getting a hold of them. There are even some stores (such as Target) that offer discounts for using reusable bags!\nThese bags are useful for things other than shopping as well. I have heard of people using reusable bags when they move!\nIf you forget your bags at home, buy a new one. Better yet, keep a couple of bags in your car so you never leave home without them (just make sure you remember you put them there)!\nIf you are in a position where you need to use plastic bags, reuse them the next time you go shopping, or use them for something else. Try not to be so quick to throw them out!\nThere are some states that are outlawing or charging extra for using plastic bags. Using reusable bags helps the environment AND your budget!\nPrint as Little as Necessary\nWe have all had that teacher that wanted us to have a copy of every single reading when we come to class, or that professor who wanted a hard copy of the ten-page paper that is due next week. These are fine but it seems as if they do not understand that using so much paper is detrimental to the environment.\nWhat can you do? Ask your teacher if you can bring a laptop or an e-reader to class so that you can download the reading onto that and read it from there. If not, print on both sides of the page to reduce the amount of paper used.\nIf you need to turn in a long paper, ask the professor if it is okay to print on both sides of the page and explain why you're asking. Most teachers care about the environment as well and would be willing to allow you to do so.\nRecycle\nRecycling is such a simple thing to do, but so many people don't do it. Many garbage disposal companies offer recycling services, so check with the company you use to see if they can help you get started! It's as simple as getting a bin and putting it out with your trash cans for free!\nAlso, check with your RA to see if recycling options are offered in your dorm.\nAnother way to recycle is to look for recycling cans near trashcans. Instead of throwing recyclables in the trash with your non-recyclables, make a point to take an extra step to locate recycling cans around your campus.\nUse a Reusable Beverage Containers\nInstead of buying individually-packaged drinks, consider buying a bulk container of the beverage you want as well as a reusable water bottle. Not only will this help the environment, but it will also help you save money since you are buying a bulk container.\nMany campuses offer water fountains designed for drinking as well as for refilling reusable water bottles. Make use of these fountains throughout the day when you finish off the initial beverage.\nAlong these lines, many restaurants offer reusable containers for drinks. If you go to a certain place a lot, conside\nDoc 3(Title: \"A 5 steps guide to prevent animal extinction - Ecobnb\") ome on, get creative! Recycle paper and cardboard, plastic, metals, glass and all the rest: you will be able to create new, fantastic objects.\nPlastic waste is a potential threat for the environment, and this includes its accumulation on the Earth surface. Beside being a powerful pollutant for the environment as a whole, it can negatively affect wildlife habitat – whether in the ocean or amongst nature.\nThe Recycling rule, applies especially for the products you buy. Make sure the packaging of your purchases (as well as its content) is made from recycled materials. Look for the special logo, and carry on with your purchase only if you see it! Also, have you ever tried second-hand products? If not, you should make it up: give it a try. It could be key in slowing down animal extinction.\nThe 3-R rule also applies to a more sustainable life in general: every small energy-saving change can have a huge impact on the health of threatened animals.\nFor example, by reducing the carbon footprint you may be able to help the environment, and improve your health at the same time.\nSmall actions, big changes\nstart by reducing the quantity of energy and fossil fuel you and your family use during the day. There are several ways of doing so:\n- Replace light bulbs, switching to energy saving ones – such as fluorescent bulbs (if you can’t find them in supermarkets, which seems really odd today, online shopping can help). In fact, fluorescent lightbulbs can work by using less fossil fuel than conventional lightbulbs.\n- Use a laptop instead of using a desktop computer when possible: laptops consume up to 5 times less!\n- On your bike!? Bike to work instead of driving. And guess what, you won’t only reduce air pollution, but this will also have a positive impact on your wallet, and on your health.\n- When leaving home, or at nighttime, make sure you turn off the heat and unplug the electronic facilities you have. Switching them off is not enough: you must unplug your laptop cords, your television, your phone charger, and even the kettle and the toaster in your kitchen. Did you know that even if you are not actually using these electronic gadgets, they still sap energy, just by being plugged in?\nBy following these tips you will be able to save not only energy and money, but you will also save the life of many endangered species.\n3. Don’t Buy Souvenirs Made From Endangered Species\nIf you do so, you are not only risking a fine, you are also increasing extinction rates. Stay away from products made from endangered (but also still-not-so-endangered) species!\nI see, you would really love to buy some iconic souvenirs on holiday, maybe to remind your family and friends the gorgeous places you visited – like a tropical beach or a South African Resort. But even if it doesn’t seem so, by making that purchase, you are actually increasing extinction rates (besides supporting illegal trading in poaching of wildlife!).\nThese products are filled with cruelty and pain, for the animals who suffered in the production process.\nThe illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth billions and billions of dollars each year. And if on the one hand it is mostly controlled by criminal gangs, it is also very much supported by the hundreds of millions of people going on foreign holidays and buying this type of souvenirs.\nThese items include materials such as tortoiseshell, ivory, reptile skins, furs, coral. Also, try to step into the animals’ shoes: have you ever thought that no one else needs a fur but a tiger? And, that no one else needs a rhino horn but a rhino? Or, that no one else needs a tortoiseshell but a tortoise?\nThink this through, you know the answer.\n4. Eat Less Meat\nBe greener! We are literally “eating our way to extinction”. The meat industry is not only damaging farmed animals, but also wild ones – and especially the ones in danger of extinction. Studies warn that meat-eaters are actually speeding worldwide animals extinction.\nBy killing them, we are killing ourse\nDoc 4(Title: \"8 Simple Ways to Help the Environment | Fastweb\") offer water fountains designed for drinking as well as for refilling reusable water bottles. Make use of these fountains throughout the day when you finish off the initial beverage.\nAlong these lines, many restaurants offer reusable containers for drinks. If you go to a certain place a lot, consider buying one of these containers to help minimize waste.\nA lot of coffee shops even offer a discount to customers who use a reusable container for their drinks. Starbucks, as an example, offers a small discount for customers who do this. Saving the environment and money? Win-win.\nDon't Throw Your Notes Away\nAt the end of the semester, students are often stuck with notes they don't need anymore, especially from GenEd classes that had little, if anything, to do with their major.\nThe good news is that teachers that teach GenEd classes have to keep their material consistent with guidelines from the college/university. This means that students next semester will be learning basically the same material you learned from a class.\nIf you took great notes, ask your teacher to connect you with students in a future class so that you can give them your notes. These notes will help students by being able to read what they are learning in the words of another student. It's beneficial to read things that are worded differently than what the teacher said. You may need to find a student on your own, depending on the teacher's load for the semester.\nIt will feel great to help others taking the same class! You can list your notes on online college boards. While some may be willing to buy the notes at a price, it will feel just as good giving them away since you are helping them out.\nAlso, other student organizations may appreciate notes. At the community college I attended, the Veteran's Club had a separate building for resources. They had an area for\ntextbooks used by students, and they could check the books out for a semester, and many people would bundle notes in with the books. Ask around to see if any organization has something like this.\nIf you can't find anyone to give the notes to, at the very least, recycle the paper you used.\nSave Electricity!\nUse energy-efficient light bulbs instead of regular bulbs. They last longer, which will save you a bit of money (every little bit helps on a college budget, right?).\nMake sure you turn off lights, the TV, and other appliances when you are not using them.\nLower your air conditioning or heat when it's not necessary. This is especially true between seasons. Open your windows and layer your clothes in the early fall.\nSave Water\nWater is wasted more frequently than we can see. Turn off the faucet as you are brushing your teeth. Don't turn your shower on until you're ready to get in and wash your hair. Limit your water usage as you wash dishes. Changing old habits will be good for both the environment and your wallet!\nAvoid Taking Cars or Carpool When Possible\nCars are harmful to the environment. Taking public transportation, walking, or riding a bike to class are better options that help the environment and your budget. It's also a way to get some exercise in!\nIf you do need to use your car, compare schedules and places of residency with those in your classes. You can split the cost of gas and have alternating schedules for who drives when. This is cheaper than everyone driving separately and you'll be closer with friends!\nBONUS: Eat Vegan\nTry eliminating the amount of meat, fish or dairy you eat each day. Doing this will help to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce energy consumption. According to an\nIndependent article, you could reduce your \"carbon footprint from food by up to 73 percent\" just by incorporating a vegan diet!\nDoc 5(Title: \"3 Major Ways Data Science is Changing the World Today\") e as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart. A part where he says his mega-neutrino bomb was secretly a saving vaccine “against humanity as the planet’s worst virus’. As in we humans suck and everything we touch turns to dust. But as it turned out, in the real world we humans are actually the good guys.\nNot only we collectively treat our planet better each year, but we also use our best minds, resources and efforts to protect it. Three industry leaders – Environmental Defense Fund, California Air Resources Board and Plant Labs – are currently working on the conjoint reporting platform, that by launching two satellites into space aims to track the present situation and any occurring climate change squarely.\nLikewise, governments and city officials are using data patterns to allocate resources more wisely in regards to traffic routes, street lights, water supply and other utilities. The ubiquitous rise of smart homes, solar power, and multilateral recycling helps developed countries to decrease energy consumption and increase their efficiency.\nThere’s even a yearly “Data Science for Social Good” event hosted by the same-name fellowship, where data scientists from all over the world get together to help mother nature and “tackle the problems that really matter”.\nConclusion\nIt turns out data matters are inextricably linked to our modern-day progress and the whole purpose of data science is to propel that progress deeper and further.

    "question": "why is traffic bad for the environment",
    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, traffic is bad for the environment primarily because it leads to higher emissions, particularly CO2 and other harmful gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. These pollutants contribute significantly to air and noise pollution, exacerbate climate change, and affect human health negatively. Traffic congestion increases fuel consumption and causes vehicles to idle more, leading to more emissions. Thus, traffic is detrimental to the environment.\n\n<answer> higher emissions </answer>\n\nTraffic is bad for the environment mainly due to higher emissions, which include CO2 and other harmful gases contributing to air and noise pollution, climate change, and health issues.",

Here are the worst consequences due to traffic congestion — and the places where people suffer the most.\nTesting your patience\nGetting into a traffic jam is every driver's nightmare. Endless minutes (or worse: hours) in which nothing's moving forward can turn what should be a short car-ride into a seemingly never-ending odyssey. But congested streets aren't just annoying for commuters — they have far-reaching consequences.\nHigher emissions\nTurn off your engine when you get into a traffic jam! You'll save fuel after 20 seconds of standing still already. Letting your engine run while your car's idling burns one liter of fuel an hour, according to Germany's technical inspection agency TÜV Süd. A higher fuel consumption rate means that more CO2 is blasted into the atmosphere, which we should avoid if we want to fight global warming.\nGermany's congestion capital\nGermany saw roughly 745,000 traffic jams in 2018, according to German automobile club ADAC. That's a three-percent increase compared to 2017. According to GPS-maker TOMTOM's last survey, Cologne's streets were the most congested (as shown above). On average, travel time increased by more than a third because of congestion, compared to free flowing traffic.\nTraffic breakdown in L.A. and Moscow\nGPS-maker INRIX uses different calculations and has identified Munich as Germany's traffic jam capital. Drivers there were stuck in congestion for an average of 51 hours a year. That's nothing compared to the world leaders: The world capital of traffic jams is Los Angeles, where drivers were stuck in traffic for 102 hours a year, followed by Moscow (pictured here) and New York with 91 hours each.\nEndangering your health\nPeople who are stuck in traffic frequently have to deal with serious health problems. When traffic isn't flowing as it should, your body releases stress hormones. Your immune system is weakened and your blood pressure rises. People who are frequently stuck in traffic jams, like commuters, are even likely to develop burnout syndrome.\nBillions in economic losses\nAccording to INRIX, the costs caused by traffic jams in Germany amounted to 80 billion euros in 2017. Goods don't reach their intended recipients on time and more fuel is burned. Both companies and private drivers suffer financially. Traffic jams \"threaten economic growth and stunt quality of life,\" INRIX head economist Graham Cookson said.\nRide-sharing apps made things worse\nFor a while hopes were high that ride-sharing services like Uber would bring down traffic. If people could easily get a ride, maybe they'd leave their own cars in the garage more often! But traffic researcher Bruce Schaller found out that the opposite was true in US cities. People took Uber instead of the subway or their bikes, while car owners kept driving their own vehicles.\nTraffic just one contributor to air pollution\nAfghanistan's capital Kabul is also dealing with congested streets. But that's not the only factor contributing to dangerous air pollution. In winter residents have taken to burning coal, car tires and trash to generate heat. Add to that diesel generators and many, many cars and you get smog that Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) calls \"deadly.\"\nDoc 2(Title: \"How Traffic Congestion Affects The Environment | Soul Fest\") If you reside in an urban area, chances are you already know the effects of traffic jams. What you may not know, however, is the extent of the effects traffic congestion can have. These effects have a significant impact on your personal life, safety, future and the environment as a whole.\nWhat is Congestion?\nTraffic congestion usually occurs when there are too many cars for the available road space. It can happen on almost any road system, but it’s commonly seen in and around urban centers such as the CBD when there is roadworks or route modifications in place. Traffic jams are often experienced with the greatest severity during the morning and evening peaks. Delays are not uncommon during the rush period, i.e. the beginning and at the end of a business day.\nBut what really causes traffic congestion?\nCongestion is often related to one or two sets conditions. Then first is inefficiencies with the traffic flow system and the second is the demand placed on the system. In some cases, it is a mixture of both. However, the causes you might be familiar with are delays caused by breakdowns, accidents or when the vehicle flow volumes are significantly raised.\nEffects of Traffic Jams on the Environment\nIt is not surprising to discover that regions with the highest number of vehicles on the roads experience higher levels of air and noise pollution on average. Cars are one of the biggest sources of pollution on the planet. What you might be surprised to discover is that slower moving vehicles cause more pollution than cars moving at freeway speeds.\nIt may seem intuitive that your vehicle burns more fuel when you travel faster, but the contrary is actually true. Maintaining a constant speed usually burns more or less a constant fuel amount. It is when you find yourself stuck in what resembles a parking lot instead of a highway that your vehicle really starts consuming gas. Constant acceleration and braking is the primary culprit and usually leads to more pollutants being pumped into the air.\nThe effects of car air pollution are significant for people residing in urban regions. High levels of nitrogen oxide are dangerous to humans. Carbon dioxide contributes to climate change, and sulfur dioxide causes acid rain. These pollutants also impair lung function, particularly in kids and adults suffering asthma.\nTraffic congestion also create high noise levels and prolonged traffic, especially in up and downhill patterns creates environments that are unpleasant. High rise buildings further intensify noise from traffic. This makes living in the urban centers very frustrating.\nMeasures to Alleviate Traffic Pollution\nWe have seen a significant reduction in the rate of emissions created by a single car, all thanks to improved engine designs, better fuel chemistry, and catalytic converters. As for the future, we can look forward to hybrid and electric cars becoming more mainstream. Companies like Tesla have contributed widely to bring this concept to life. Electric vehicles are also less noisy compared to conventional models, and this gives everyone peace of mind, regardless of the traffic situation.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Timeline of Major Accomplishments in Transportation Air Pollution and ...\") Timeline of Major Accomplishments in Transportation, Air Pollution, and Climate Change\nAir pollution and cars were first linked in the early 1950’s by a California researcher who determined that pollutants from traffic was to blame for the smoggy skies over Los Angeles. At the time, typical new cars were emitting nearly 13 grams per mile hydrocarbons (HC), 3.6 grams per mile nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 87 grams per mile carbon monoxide (CO). Since then, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set standards to bring down levels of these pollutants, and the auto industry has responded by developing new emission control technologies.\nOver time, Congress authorized EPA to regulate emissions from other mobile sources of air pollution, such as heavy-duty trucks, agricultural and construction equipment, locomotives, lawn and garden equipment, and marine engines. These milestones in controlling emissions from mobile sources involve a variety of approaches including technological advances in engine design to higher quality fuels. This integrated approach to mobile source emission control also depends on extensive collaboration between EPA; vehicle, engine, and fuel manufacturers; state and local governments; transportation planners; and individual citizens.\n1970\nCongress passes the first major Clean Air Act, requiring a 90 percent reduction in emissions from new automobiles by 1975. President Richard Nixon establishes EPA, and the new agency is given it broad responsibility for regulating motor vehicle pollution. New cars must meet EPA emission standards for hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx). The law also directs EPA to set health-based \"National Ambient Air Quality Standards\" for six pollutants.\n1971\nEPA begins testing the fuel economy of cars, trucks, and other vehicles, the first step towards informing consumers about the gas mileage of their vehicles.\n1972\nExhaust gas recirculation valves are developed as automakers strive to meet NOx standards.\n1973\nEPA creates new transportation controls in some of the nation’s largest cities, including Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, and others. Measures include exclusive bus lanes, bypass lanes for carpools and buses, parking garages and restrictions, and a mass transit incentive plan for California employers.\nEPA releases a study confirming that lead from automobile exhaust poses a direct threat to public health. Later that year, EPA issues final regulations to gradually reducing lead in gasoline.\n1975\nCongress passes the Energy Policy Conservation Act, setting the first fuel economy goals. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program establishes a phase-in of more stringent fuel economy standards beginning with 1975 model vehicles.\nThe \"first generation\" catalytic converters are built, significantly reducing vehicle emissions. Unleaded gasoline is also introduced because lead in gasoline may cause disintegration of catalytic converters. This results in dramatic reductions in ambient lead levels and alleviates many serious environmental and human health concerns associated with lead pollution.\n1977\nCongress amends the Clean Air Act which set a schedule for continued reductions in emissions from automobiles.\n1981\nNew cars meet the amended Clean Air Act standards for the first time. Sophisticated three-way catalysts with on-board computers and oxygen sensors appear in most new cars, helping to optimize the efficiency of the catalytic converter.\n1983\nInspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs are established in areas with air pollution problems, requiring passenger vehicles to undergo periodic testing for malfunctioning emission control systems.\n1985\nEPA sets stringent standards for emissions of NOx from heavy-duty engines and of PM from heavy-duty diesel-powered trucks and buses.\nEPA issues final regulations to cut the amount of lead in gasoline by 90 percent starting January 1, 1986. The new standard is 0.10 grams per gallon.\n1989\nFor the first time, EPA s\nDoc 4(Title: \"Air Pollution - Our World in Data\") Air Pollution\nOur overview of indoor and outdoor air pollution.\nThis article was first published in October 2017. We made minor changes to the text in February 2024.\nAir pollution is one of the world's largest health and environmental problems. It develops in two contexts: indoor (household) air pollution and outdoor air pollution.\nIn this topic page, we look at the aggregate picture of air pollution – both indoor and outdoor. We also have dedicated topic pages that look in more depth at these subjects:\nIndoor Air Pollution\nLook in detail at the data and research on the health impacts of Indoor Air Pollution, attributed deaths, and its causes across the world\nOutdoor Air Pollution\nLook in detail at the data and research on exposure to Outdoor Air Pollution, its health impacts, and attributed deaths across the world\nEnergy\nLook in detail at the data and research on energy consumption, its impacts around the world today, and how this has changed over time\nSee all interactive charts on Air Pollution ↓\nOther research and writing on air pollution on Our World in Data:\n- Air pollution: does it get worse before it gets better?\n- Data Review: How many people die from air pollution?\n- Energy poverty and indoor air pollution: a problem as old as humanity that we can end within our lifetime\n- How many people do not have access to clean fuels for cooking?\n- What are the safest and cleanest sources of energy?\n- What the history of London’s air pollution can tell us about the future of today’s growing megacities\n- When will countries phase out coal power?\nAir pollution is one of the world's leading risk factors for death\nAir pollution is responsible for millions of deaths each year\nAir pollution – the combination of outdoor and indoor particulate matter and ozone – is a risk factor for many of the leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), in its Global Burden of Disease study, provides estimates of the number of deaths attributed to the range of risk factors for disease.1\nIn the visualization, we see the number of deaths per year attributed to each risk factor. This chart shows the global total but can be explored for any country or region using the \"change country\" toggle.\nAir pollution is one of the leading risk factors for death. In low-income countries, it is often very near the top of the list (or is the leading risk factor).\nAir pollution contributes to one in ten deaths globally\nIn recent years, air pollution has contributed to one in ten deaths globally.2\nIn the map shown here, we see the share of deaths attributed to air pollution across the world.\nAir pollution is one of the leading risk factors for disease burden\nAir pollution is one of the leading risk factors for death. But its impacts go even further; it is also one of the main contributors to the global disease burden.\nGlobal disease burden takes into account not only years of life lost to early death but also the number of years lived in poor health.\nIn the visualization, we see risk factors ranked in order of DALYs – disability-adjusted life years – the metric used to assess disease burden. Again, air pollution is near the top of the list, making it one of the leading risk factors for poor health across the world.\nAir pollution not only takes years from people's lives but also has a large effect on the quality of life while they're still living.\nWho is most affected by air pollution?\nDeath rates from air pollution are highest in low-to-middle-income countries\nAir pollution is a health and environmental issue across all countries of the world but with large differences in severity.\nIn the interactive map, we show death rates from air pollution across the world, measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 people in a given country or region.\nThe burden of air pollution tends to be greater across both lo\nDoc 5(Title: \"Over the Last 43 Years Here's How Much Pollution We've Put Into the Air\") Over the Last 43 Years, Here's How Much Pollution We've Put Into the Air\nWhile pollution and its effect on climate change may be international problems, not all countries are equally at fault.\nDespite the changing international landscape and the rise of powerful industrial economies such in India and Russia, nearly half of the world's CO2 emissions can be squarely blamed on two countries: the U.S. and China.\nThe latter firmly cemented its leading status in 2007, although the U.S. emission levels are not looking any lower. Here is a map illustrating just how much CO2 emission these two countries dump on the rest of the world:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nCarbon emissions have been on the rise since 1971, with a steady annual increase of 2%. The global output is expected to rise by another 39% by 2030. In the U.S. alone, CO2 emissions have increased by 10% between 1999 and 2011.\nHow does that look compared to the rest of the world? Surprisingly enough, the global landscape of carbon emission has not changed much over the years. Here's a GIF simulating CO2 output in 1971:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nMost of the carbon emissions are concentrated in North America, Europe and East Asia, with the only noticeable outlier being South Africa.\nNow here is a version that illustrates how the carbon outputs look in 2011:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nThe most obvious increase is in China, which is covered by the CO2 clouds. Other countries that increased their presence on the map include Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India and Australia, while western Europe significantly cut down its output. But other than a few noticeable additions and eliminations, the distribution of carbon emission across the world looks remarkably similar to how it did back in 1971.\nIn pie chart form, it becomes even more telling just how much impact the U.S. and China's CO2 dump has on the rest of the world:\nImage Credit: EPA\nIn 2008, U.S. CO2 output was equal to India and 24 EU countries' combined output. As for China, it emitted as much CO2 as the U.S. and Japan combined.\nChina has been under a ton of pressure to deal with its insane air pollution problem, and it looks like its emissions may finally be slowing down. It's also drafting a comprehensive climate change bill to reform its energy policy. Chinese officials are considering a carbon tax, and by 2040, they want to reduce CO2 output by 40% of the 2005 levels.\nBut no matter how many doomsday scenarios are foretold, the U.S. remains frustratingly slow on curbing down carbon emission. Despite improved energy efficiency and increased popularity of alternative energy sources, the U.S. ended its recent CO2 decline streak with a 2% increase in 2013.

That document was known as the Emancipation Proclamation.\nThis executive order was drafted and signed by Abraham Lincoln on January 1st, 1863, during the Civil War. Many people believe that the emancipation proclamation effectively ended slavery but the truth is far more complicated than that.\nRecommended Reading\nLouisiana Purchase: Date, Cost, Importance, and Results\nEmancipation Proclamation: Effects, Impacts, and Outcomes\nHow Old Is the United States of America?\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was a momentous occasion in the history of the United States. It was created by Abraham Lincoln as a way to try and take advantage of the rebellion that was currently underway in the south. This rebellion was known as the Civil War, with the North and the South divided due to ideological differences.\nThe political situation of the Civil War was relatively dire. With the South in a state of outright rebellion, it was on Abraham Lincoln’s shoulders to try and preserve the Union at all costs. The war itself was still not recognized by the North as a war, because Abraham Lincoln refused to recognize the South as its own nation. While the South prefer to call itself the Confederate States of America, to the north they were still states of the United States of America.\nCivil War Biographies\nAnn Rutledge: Abraham Lincoln’s First True Love?\nThe Paradoxical President: Re-imagining Abraham Lincoln\nThe Right Arm of Custer: Colonel James H. Kidd\nNathan Bedford Forrest: Life and Service of the Military Genius\nThe Emancipation Proclamation’s entire purpose was to free the slaves in the South. In fact, the Emancipation Proclamation had nothing to do with slavery in the North. The Union would still be a slave nation during the war, despite the fact that Abraham Lincoln would y be laying the ground for a greater abolitionist movement. When the proclamation was passed, it was aimed at the states that were currently in rebellion; the entire purpose was to disarm the South.\nDuring the Civil War, the Southern economy was primarily based on slavery. With the majority of men fighting in the Civil War, slaves were used primarily for reinforcing soldiers, transporting goods, and working in agricultural labor back home. The South did not have the same level of industrialism without slavery, as the North did. Essentially, when Lincoln passed to the Emancipation Proclamation it was actually an attempt to weaken the Confederate states by removing one of their strongest methods of production.\nThis decision was primarily pragmatic; Lincoln was focused entirely on disarming the South. However, regardless of intentions, the Emancipation Proclamation signaled a shift in the purpose of the Civil War. The war was no longer simply about preserving the state of the union, the war was more or less about ending slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation was not a well-received action. It was a strange political maneuver and even most of Lincoln’s cabinet was hesitant to believe that it would be effective. The reason that the Emancipation Proclamation is such a curious document is because it was passed as under the President’s war-time powers.\nNormally, the American Presidency has very little power of decree. Lawmaking and legislative control belongs to Congress. The President does have the ability to issue what is known as an executive order. Executive orders have the full backing and force of a law, but for the most part they are subject to control from Congress. The president himself has very little power outside of what Congress allows, except in wartime. As the commander-in-chief, the president has the ability to use wartime powers to enforce special laws. The Emancipation Proclamation was one of those laws that Lincoln had used his military powers to enforce.\nOriginally, Lincoln believed in the progressive elimination of slavery in al\nDoc 2(Title: \"Emancipation Proclamation: Effects Impacts and Outcomes\") t in wartime. As the commander-in-chief, the president has the ability to use wartime powers to enforce special laws. The Emancipation Proclamation was one of those laws that Lincoln had used his military powers to enforce.\nOriginally, Lincoln believed in the progressive elimination of slavery in all states. He believed that it was primarily up to the states to oversee the progressive abolition of slavery in their own individual power. Regardless of his political position on the matter, however, Lincoln had always believed that slavery was wrong. The Emancipation Proclamation served more as a military maneuver than a political maneuver. At the same time, this action cemented Lincoln as being a staunchly aggressive abolitionist and would ensure that slavery would eventually be removed from the entire United States.\nOne major political effect that the Emancipation Proclamation had was the fact that it invited slaves to serve in the Union Army. Such an action was a brilliant strategic choice. The decision to pass a law that told all slaves from the South that they were free and encouraging them to take up arms to join in the fight against their former masters was the brilliant tactical maneuver. Ultimately with those permissions, many freed slaves joined the Northern Army, drastically increasing their manpower. The North by the end of the war had over 200,000 African-Americans fighting for them.\nThe South was more or less in a state of turmoil after such an announcement. The proclamation had actually been publicized three times, the first time as a threat, the second time as a more formal announcement and then the third time as the signing of the Proclamation. When the Confederates heard the news, they were in a state of severe disrepair. One of them primary issues was that as the North advanced into territories and seized control of Southern land, they would often capture slaves. These slaves were simply restricted as contraband, not returned to their owners – the South.\nWhen the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, all current contraband, i.e. the slaves, were freed at the stroke of midnight. There was no offer of compensation, payment, or even a fair trade to the slave-owners. These slave-holders were suddenly deprived of what they believe to be property. Combined with the sudden loss of a large number of slaves, and influx of troops that would provide the North with additional firepower, the South found itself in a very tough position. Slaves were now able to escape from the South and as soon as they made it into the North, they would be free.\nYet as important as the Emancipation Proclamation was to America’s history, its actual impact on slavery was minimal at best. If nothing more, it was a way to solidify the president’s position as an abolitionist and to ensure the fact that slavery would be ended. Slavery wasn’t officially ended in the United States of America until the 13th Amendment was passed, in 1865.\nOne of the issues with the Emancipation Proclamation was that it was passed as a wartime measure. As stated before, in the United States, laws are not passed through the president, they are passed by Congress. This left the actual freedom status of the slaves up in the air. If the North were to win the war, the Emancipation Proclamation would not continue to be a constitutionally legal document. It would need to be ratified by the government in order to stay in effect.\nThe purpose of the Emancipation Proclamation has been muddled over the course of history. The basic line of though is that it freed the slaves. That is only partially correct, it merely freed the slaves in the South, something that wasn’t particularly enforceable due to the fact South was in a state of rebellion. What it did do however was ensure that if the North won, the South would be forced to free all of their slaves. Ultimately that would lead to the freedom of 3.1 million slaves. However, most of those slaves were not free until after the war h\nDoc 3(Title: \"Emancipation Proclamation: Effects Impacts and Outcomes\") ceable due to the fact South was in a state of rebellion.

However, most of those slaves were not free until after the war had concluded.\nLatest US History Articles\nWho Invented the Assembly Line?

The proslavery movement believed that it was wrong and immoral for the president to inflict such a thing, but their hands were tied due to the fact that they wanted the Union to be preserved. The North had originally tried to use the Emancipation Proclamation as a threat to the South.\nThe terms were simple, return to the Union or face the dire consequences of having all slaves freed. When the South refused to return, the North decided to unleash the document. This left Lincoln’s political opponents in a bind because they didn’t want to lose their slaves, but at the same time it would be a disaster if United States were to divide up into two different nations.\nThere was a lot of flak in the abolitionist movement as well. Many of the abolitionists believed that it wasn’t a sufficient document because it did not totally eradicate slavery and in fact was barely enforceable in the states that it did authorize such release. Since the South was in a state of war, there wasn’t much impetus for them to comply with the order.\nLincoln was criticized by many different factions, and even among historians there is a question as to what his motives were in his decisions. But it is important to remember that the success of the Emancipation Proclamation hinged on the victory of the North. If the North was successful and was able to seize control of the Union once again, reunifying all the states and putting the South out of its state of rebellion, it would have freed all of their slaves.\nThere was no going back from this decision. The rest of America would be forced to follow suit. This meant that Abraham Lincoln was well aware of the ramifications of his actions. He knew that the Emancipation Proclamation was not a permanent, final solution to the problem of slavery but rather it was a powerful opening salvo to an entirely new type of war.\nThis changed the purpose of the Civil War as well. Prior to the Emancipation Proclamation, the North was engaged in military action against the South due to the fact of the South was trying to secede from the Union. Originally, the war as seen by the North, was a war to preserve the unity of America. The South was trying to secede because of a myriad of reasons. There are a lot of simplistic reasons offered for why the North and the South were divided.\nThe most common reason stated is that the South wanted to have slavery and Lincoln was purely a staunch abolitionist. Another theory was that the Civil War was started because the South wanted a greater level of states’ rights, whereas the current Republican Party was pushing for a more unified type of government. The reality is that the motivations of the South’s secession is a mixed bag. It was most likely a collection of all the above ideas. To say there was a single reason for the Civil War is a massive underestimation of how politics works.\nRegardless of the South’s purpose for leaving the union, when the North made the decision to free the slaves, it became very clear that this would become an abolitionist war. The South relied heavily on their slaves in order to survive. Their economics were based primarily on a slave economy, as opposed to the North which had been developing a primarily industrial economy.\nThe North with higher level of education, weaponry, and production capability did not rely on slaves a\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Emancipation Proclamation and the Meaning of the War ...\") r his weak attempts to pacify the nation and avoid war, his inaction only strengthened slavery’s foothold and inflamed divisions further.\nBut what was Lincoln’s role?

Furthermore, by understanding the origins of racial differences in behavior we can more effectively develop interventions that mitigate these differences. But it’s important to note that interventions like the belonging intervention are attempts to address the symptoms of racial inequality; they do not deal with inequality at its source by ameliorating historical injustice or correcting current discrimination (as found in the hiring and housing studies discussed above).\nIn summary\nTaking in all of the research discussed above, the role of discrimination in racial inequality has such a strong foundation in historical and empirical facts that denying the role of discrimination is to depart from a scientifically informed view. On the other hand, the notion that racial inequality is at least in part due to values, behavior, and choices is true to some extent as well. Indeed, this is at the heart of much of the research about how to close achievement gaps between Black and white students. However, the perspective found in academic journals is communicated in quite different terms compared to some conservative arguments. Scientists and historians know that racial disparities in values, behaviors, choices, and even culture have emerged in a continually discriminatory environment with intergenerational disadvantages that maintained racial inequality (the subject of another article of mine). My investigation suggests that a science-based model of the causes of inequality accepts both narratives as partly true and not mutually exclusive.\nIf someone uses the argument that individual differences in values, culture, or behavior accounts for racial disparities as a way to deny discrimination as a cause, they are no longer aligned with the scientific evidence; we know discrimination is real, is currently happening, and is part of the story of inequality. If they cite individual differences as a way of blaming disadvantaged groups for their own disadvantage, they are also not aligned with the scientific evidence; we know that many of these individual differences emerge from a historical and current context of inequality that Black communities have had minimal control over. On the other hand, if someone is denying any role for individual differences, they have also departed from the relevant science.\nIn this era of extreme partisanship and misinformation, it is more important than ever to ensure that our ideological perspectives are tempered and informed by the scientific evidence. The causal story behind racial inequality is extremely complex; I have barely scratched the surface in this article. We should leave no tool out of our tool box in order to solve the problem of racial inequality. We need people to investigate and study discrimination, the individual differences that account for inequality, the contexts that give rise to the individual differences, and the systematic forces at work. We also need science-based interventions and advocacy to address both the causes and symptoms of racial inequality. The resulting research should guide our thinking about these topics and help us find solutions. That means admitting the interplay between contexts and choices, between decisions and discrimination, and between history and the here-and-now.\n*Update 1/5/2021: For the sake of time, I left off the interesting academic debate about audit studies.

End residential segregation.\nHigher levels of racial residential segregation within a metropolitan region are strongly correlated with significantly reduced levels of intergenerational upward mobility for all residents of that area. Segregation by income, particularly the isolation of low-income households, also correlates with significantly reduced levels of upward mobility. Eliminating residential segregation by income and race can boost economic mobility for all.\nBut getting policymakers to prioritize these policies will depend on the actions of advocates, voters and other supporters with a vision for a fair and inclusive society so strong that they overwhelm powerful forces that seek to maintain the status quo.\nEach of these policies, if carefully implemented, has the potential to lift working families out of poverty, support greater economic mobility and/or reduce the growth of inequality. All of these policies could be enacted at the local, state and federal levels if there is political will. While there is still some disagreements of the best way to reduce inequality, there is a growing consensus that inequality should be reduce.\nRecently the IMF joined this consensus in finding that inequality reduces overall economy growth as well as challenges basic democratic principle and fairness. But getting policymakers to prioritize these policies will depend on the actions of advocates, voters and other supporters with a vision for a fair and inclusive society so strong that they overwhelm powerful forces that seek to maintain the status quo.\nThis article originally appeared on the Huffington Post.\nThe ideas expressed on the Haas Institute blog are not necessarily those of UC Berkeley or the Division of Equity & Inclusion, where the Haas Institute website is hosted.

In these studies, there are white and Black auditors who submit housing applications with identical information, except the person submitting the application is either Black or white. Often, the auditors are even trained to give the same responses during interactions with realtors. Again, scientists here try to control for every other conceivable factor besides race. In a meta-analysis representing 72 housing audit studies in the US, Canada, and Europe, researchers evaluated the level of housing discrimination since the 70s. During the 70s through the 90s, Black people were about 50% less likely to receive a positive response from a housing application compared to whites. Other studies showed that discrimination decreased after the 90s so that Blacks are only 25% less likely to receive a positive response on a housing application. The most recent estimate shows that Black people today are still about 15% less likely to get those positive responses compared to whites. While it has decreased, this current level of discrimination still represents a significant difference in how equally qualified Black people and white people are treated. Worse still, this decrease has coincided with other forms of housing discrimination such as on Airbnb where applications from accounts with Black names are 16% less likely to be accepted relative to identical white accounts. Homeownership is an effective way of building wealth, particularly for low-income and minority households, so housing discrimination has likely had important downstream effects that have contributed to economic inequality across the generations.\nEconomic discrimination between equally qualified Black and white people is found in a variety of domains, such as car purchasing, getting home insurance, getting a mortgage, and even hailing a taxi! The discrimination Black Americans face is sickening–literally. A 2015 meta-analysis documented that experiences with discrimination and racism in day-to-day life predicts poorer health for Black people. Data taken from 293 studies showed that reported racism predicted both poorer mental and physical health. Even within the doctor’s office, patients cannot escape the effects of racial discrimination. An audit-style study was done with physicians making recommendations about Black and white patients portrayed by actors with identical histories. Black patients were less likely to be referred for potentially life-saving treatment compared to whites with the same clinical presentation. Similar audit work has found racial discrimination towards middle class Black patients in the mental health context. Doctors have been found to harbor a racial bias that Black people are less sensitive to pain (which is likely the opposite of what is true) and thus under-prescribe pain medication to Black patients. But the effects of bias extend beyond just pain treatment. A 2015 systematic review found that racial bias of medical professionals predicts racial disparities in treatment decisions, treatment adherence, patient-provider interactions, and ultimately patient health.\nThe evidence is clear*: discrimination does indeed cause racial disparities. It’s important to recognize that these studies demonstrate discrimination between otherwise identical people. In the audit studies I reviewed above Black people weren’t discriminated against for being poor, or uneducated, or having a criminal background. All of that is controlled for in these studies. These studies demonstrate in no uncertain terms that Black Americans in the modern era are being discriminated against simply because of their race. As discussed above, racial discrimination accounts for some significant portion of disparities in employment, income, wealth, housing, transportation, and medical treatment. Black people are even discriminated against in the primary domain they have to meaningfully influence the polici\nDoc 4(Title: \"Why is Racism a Problem? - Free Essay Example | PapersOwl.com\") How To Write An Essay On Racism\nIntroduction to the Complexities of Racism\nWriting an essay on racism involves delving into a complex and sensitive subject that has deep historical roots and contemporary implications. Begin your essay by defining racism as a system of discrimination based on race, affecting individuals and groups socially, economically, and politically. Highlight the importance of understanding racism not only as overt acts of discrimination but also as institutional and systemic practices. This introduction should lay the groundwork for your exploration, whether it’s focused on historical aspects of racism, its manifestations in modern society, or strategies for combating racial prejudice and inequality.\nHistorical Context and Evolution of Racism\nThe body of your essay should include a detailed examination of the historical context and evolution of racism. Discuss how racism has been perpetuated and institutionalized over time, highlighting key historical events and policies that have contributed to racial discrimination and segregation. Depending on your essay’s focus, you might explore the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, Jim Crow laws, or apartheid, among other topics. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding how past injustices continue to shape present racial dynamics and attitudes.\nAnalyzing Modern Manifestations of Racism\nTransition to discussing the modern manifestations of racism. Examine how racism operates in current societal structures, such as in the criminal justice system, education, employment, and healthcare. Discuss the concept of systemic racism and how it perpetuates inequality, as well as the impact of racial bias and stereotypes in media representation and everyday interactions. This section should also address the intersectionality of racism, acknowledging how race intersects with other identities like gender, class, and sexuality, contributing to unique experiences of discrimination.\nStrategies for Addressing and Combating Racism\nConclude your essay by exploring strategies for addressing and combating racism. Discuss the importance of education, awareness-raising, and open dialogue in challenging racist beliefs and stereotypes. Reflect on the role of policy changes, affirmative action, and reparations in addressing systemic racism. Emphasize the importance of individual and collective action in fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. Your conclusion should not only summarize the key points of your essay but also inspire a sense of hope and commitment to anti-racist efforts, underscoring the ongoing work needed to dismantle racism in all its forms.\nDoc 5(Title: \"Why is there racial inequality in the US? – The Science of ...\") Conservatives and liberals offer differing views on the causes of racial inequality.\nWhat does the experimental evidence say?\nThe Black Lives Matter protests and associated high profile cases of police violence against unarmed Black men has catalyzed a conversation about race in the US. However, the problem of racial inequality extends far beyond policing. Racial inequality has a deep history in the US and despite the struggles in the Civil Rights Era that resulted in (mostly) legal equality, there is still vast inequality between Black and white citizens in practice.\nIt is hard to overstate just how clear the evidence is for the claim that racial inequality is an ongoing problem in the United States. While there is probably a handful of people who would deny this reality, most people across the political spectrum agree that there is racial inequality. Where people disagree is on the question of why there is racial inequality. There are essentially two competing narratives: 1) “Racial inequality is caused by historical and ongoing discrimination,” or 2) “Racial inequality is due to differences in choices, culture, and/or values.” The former narrative emphasizes that the Black community has been (and continues to be) held back by racism on an individual and systemic basis. The latter narrative emphasizes the legal equality that Blacks and whites share and thus attributes disparities to differences across individuals in each group.\nWhich of these narratives one endorses is highly correlated with their demographic group. Conservatives (compared to liberals), are more likely to adopt the latter narrative. In other words, they are much less likely to agree that discrimination is the main reason Black people can’t get ahead. Similarly, whites (compared to Black Americans), are much less likely to cite discrimination, lower quality schools, and lack of jobs as the causes of inequality. The polls cited above also show there are similar racial and ideological splits on perceptions of the Black Lives Matter movement. Beyond this polling data, you can find plenty of examples of these narratives emerging out of their respective demographic camps.\nIn the conservative magazine National Review, attorney Peter Kirsanow argues that “individual behavior, family structure, perverse governmental policies, and culture” are largely ignored when discussing racial inequality. He also claims that “systemic, structural, or institutional racism” are over-emphasized by liberals in a politically convenient ploy. Popular conservative commentator Ben Shapiro echoed this perspective here saying racial inequality, “has nothing to do with race, and everything to do with culture.”\nThe alternative narrative, that racial inequality is caused by historical and ongoing discrimination, is actually quite widespread in the news media even within outlets that are somewhat “down the middle”. For example, this USA Today article connects disparities in police violence and coronavirus deaths to systemic racism. The author argues that aspects of racial inequality are “intimately connected” and points to a legacy of discrimination as the cause of current housing disparities between white people and Black people. For a more liberal example, this Mashable article succinctly claims that systemic racism “is everywhere” and also links it to racial disparities related COVID-19 and high profile policing deaths.\nExperimental research\nThe statistics about racial inequality are basically correlations. Being Black is correlated with a variety of disadvantages; being white is correlated with a variety of advantages. So how can we understand what causes these advantages and disadvantages? Well, how do scientists typically establish causation? The best tool scientists have to determine cause and effect is the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).

A 2015 meta-analysis documented that experiences with discrimination and racism in day-to-day life predicts poorer health for Black people. Data taken from 293 studies showed that reported racism predicted both poorer mental and physical health. Even within the doctor’s office, patients cannot escape the effects of racial discrimination. An audit-style study was done with physicians making recommendations about Black and white patients portrayed by actors with identical histories. Black patients were less likely to be referred for potentially life-saving treatment compared to whites with the same clinical presentation. Similar audit work has found racial discrimination towards middle class Black patients in the mental health context. Doctors have been found to harbor a racial bias that Black people are less sensitive to pain (which is likely the opposite of what is true) and thus under-prescribe pain medication to Black patients. But the effects of bias extend beyond just pain treatment. A 2015 systematic review found that racial bias of medical professionals predicts racial disparities in treatment decisions, treatment adherence, patient-provider interactions, and ultimately patient health.\nThe evidence is clear*: discrimination does indeed cause racial disparities. It’s important to recognize that these studies demonstrate discrimination between otherwise identical people. In the audit studies I reviewed above Black people weren’t discriminated against for being poor, or uneducated, or having a criminal background. All of that is controlled for in these studies. These studies demonstrate in no uncertain terms that Black Americans in the modern era are being discriminated against simply because of their race. As discussed above, racial discrimination accounts for some significant portion of disparities in employment, income, wealth, housing, transportation, and medical treatment. Black people are even discriminated against in the primary domain they have to meaningfully influence the polici\nDoc 4(Title: \"Emancipation Proclamation: Effects Impacts and Outcomes\") There is one document from the American Civil War that is considered to be one of the most important, valuable and impactful of all documents. That document was known as the Emancipation Proclamation.\nThis executive order was drafted and signed by Abraham Lincoln on January 1st, 1863, during the Civil War. Many people believe that the emancipation proclamation effectively ended slavery but the truth is far more complicated than that.\nRecommended Reading\nLouisiana Purchase: Date, Cost, Importance, and Results\nEmancipation Proclamation: Effects, Impacts, and Outcomes\nHow Old Is the United States of America?\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was a momentous occasion in the history of the United States. It was created by Abraham Lincoln as a way to try and take advantage of the rebellion that was currently underway in the south. This rebellion was known as the Civil War, with the North and the South divided due to ideological differences.\nThe political situation of the Civil War was relatively dire. With the South in a state of outright rebellion, it was on Abraham Lincoln’s shoulders to try and preserve the Union at all costs. The war itself was still not recognized by the North as a war, because Abraham Lincoln refused to recognize the South as its own nation. While the South prefer to call itself the Confederate States of America, to the north they were still states of the United States of America.\nCivil War Biographies\nAnn Rutledge: Abraham Lincoln’s First True Love?\nThe Paradoxical President: Re-imagining Abraham Lincoln\nThe Right Arm of Custer: Colonel James H. Kidd\nNathan Bedford Forrest: Life and Service of the Military Genius\nThe Emancipation Proclamation’s entire purpose was to free the slaves in the South. In fact, the Emancipation Proclamation had nothing to do with slavery in the North. The Union would still be a slave nation during the war, despite the fact that Abraham Lincoln would y be laying the ground for a greater abolitionist movement. When the proclamation was passed, it was aimed at the states that were currently in rebellion; the entire purpose was to disarm the South.\nDuring the Civil War, the Southern economy was primarily based on slavery. With the majority of men fighting in the Civil War, slaves were used primarily for reinforcing soldiers, transporting goods, and working in agricultural labor back home. The South did not have the same level of industrialism without slavery, as the North did. Essentially, when Lincoln passed to the Emancipation Proclamation it was actually an attempt to weaken the Confederate states by removing one of their strongest methods of production.\nThis decision was primarily pragmatic; Lincoln was focused entirely on disarming the South. However, regardless of intentions, the Emancipation Proclamation signaled a shift in the purpose of the Civil War. The war was no longer simply about preserving the state of the union, the war was more or less about ending slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation was not a well-received action. It was a strange political maneuver and even most of Lincoln’s cabinet was hesitant to believe that it would be effective. The reason that the Emancipation Proclamation is such a curious document is because it was passed as under the President’s war-time powers.\nNormally, the American Presidency has very little power of decree. Lawmaking and legislative control belongs to Congress. The President does have the ability to issue what is known as an executive order. Executive orders have the full backing and force of a law, but for the most part they are subject to control from Congress. The president himself has very little power outside of what Congress allows, except in wartime. As the commander-in-chief, the president has the ability to use wartime powers to enforce special laws. The Emancipation Proclamation was one of those laws that Lincoln had used his military powers to enforce.\nOriginally, Lincoln believed in the progressive elimination of slavery in al\nDoc 5(Title: \"Emancipation Proclamation: Effects Impacts and Outcomes\") ceable due to the fact South was in a state of rebellion. What it did do however was ensure that if the North won, the South would be forced to free all of their slaves. Ultimately that would lead to the freedom of 3.1 million slaves. However, most of those slaves were not free until after the war had concluded.\nLatest US History Articles\nWho Invented the Assembly Line? Henry Ford and the History of the Assembly Line\nWho Invented the Cotton Gin? Eli Whitney and Cotton Gin Impact on America\nThe Most Famous Outlaws of the Wild West: Jesse James to Robert Leroy Parker\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was criticized on all sides of the political spectrum. The proslavery movement believed that it was wrong and immoral for the president to inflict such a thing, but their hands were tied due to the fact that they wanted the Union to be preserved. The North had originally tried to use the Emancipation Proclamation as a threat to the South.\nThe terms were simple, return to the Union or face the dire consequences of having all slaves freed. When the South refused to return, the North decided to unleash the document. This left Lincoln’s political opponents in a bind because they didn’t want to lose their slaves, but at the same time it would be a disaster if United States were to divide up into two different nations.\nThere was a lot of flak in the abolitionist movement as well. Many of the abolitionists believed that it wasn’t a sufficient document because it did not totally eradicate slavery and in fact was barely enforceable in the states that it did authorize such release. Since the South was in a state of war, there wasn’t much impetus for them to comply with the order.\nLincoln was criticized by many different factions, and even among historians there is a question as to what his motives were in his decisions. But it is important to remember that the success of the Emancipation Proclamation hinged on the victory of the North. If the North was successful and was able to seize control of the Union once again, reunifying all the states and putting the South out of its state of rebellion, it would have freed all of their slaves.\nThere was no going back from this decision. The rest of America would be forced to follow suit. This meant that Abraham Lincoln was well aware of the ramifications of his actions. He knew that the Emancipation Proclamation was not a permanent, final solution to the problem of slavery but rather it was a powerful opening salvo to an entirely new type of war.\nThis changed the purpose of the Civil War as well. Prior to the Emancipation Proclamation, the North was engaged in military action against the South due to the fact of the South was trying to secede from the Union. Originally, the war as seen by the North, was a war to preserve the unity of America. The South was trying to secede because of a myriad of reasons. There are a lot of simplistic reasons offered for why the North and the South were divided.\nThe most common reason stated is that the South wanted to have slavery and Lincoln was purely a staunch abolitionist. Another theory was that the Civil War was started because the South wanted a greater level of states’ rights, whereas the current Republican Party was pushing for a more unified type of government. The reality is that the motivations of the South’s secession is a mixed bag. It was most likely a collection of all the above ideas. To say there was a single reason for the Civil War is a massive underestimation of how politics works.\nRegardless of the South’s purpose for leaving the union, when the North made the decision to free the slaves, it became very clear that this would become an abolitionist war. The South relied heavily on their slaves in order to survive. Their economics were based primarily on a slave economy, as opposed to the North which had been developing a primarily industrial economy.\nThe North with higher level of education, weaponry, and production capability did not rely on slaves a\n</information>\n\n\nThe documents provided highlight that zoning ordinances historically contributed to racial segregation through discriminatory practices.

Italy comprises some of the most varied and scenic landscapes on Earth and is often described as a country shaped like a boot. At its broad top stand the Alps, which are among the world’s most rugged mountains. Italy’s highest points are along Monte Rosa, which peaks in Switzerland, and along Mont Blanc, which peaks in France. The western Alps overlook a landscape of Alpine lakes and glacier-carved valleys that stretch down to the Po River and the Piedmont. Tuscany, to the south of the cisalpine region, is perhaps the country’s best-known region. From the central Alps, running down the length of the country, radiates the tall Apennine Range, which widens near Rome to cover nearly the entire width of the Italian peninsula. South of Rome the Apennines narrow and are flanked by two wide coastal plains, one facing the Tyrrhenian Sea and the other the Adriatic Sea. Much of the lower Apennine chain is near-wilderness, hosting a wide range of species rarely seen elsewhere in western Europe, such as wild boars, wolves, asps, and bears. The southern Apennines are also tectonically unstable, with several active volcanoes, including Vesuvius, which from time to time belches ash and steam into the air above Naples and its island-strewn bay. At the bottom of the country, in the Mediterranean Sea, lie the islands of Sicily and Sardinia.\nItaly’s political geography has been conditioned by this rugged landscape. With few direct roads between them, and with passage from one point to another traditionally difficult, Italy’s towns and cities have a history of self-sufficiency, independence, and mutual mistrust.

At peace for more than half a century now, Italy’s inhabitants enjoy a high standard of living and a highly developed culture.\nThough its archaeological record stretches back tens of thousands of years, Italian history begins with the Etruscans, an ancient civilization that rose between the Arno and Tiber rivers. The Etruscans were supplanted in the 3rd century bce by the Romans, who soon became the chief power in the Mediterranean world and whose empire stretched from India to Scotland by the 2nd century ce. That empire was rarely secure, not only because of the unwillingness of conquered peoples to stay conquered but also because of power struggles between competing Roman political factions, military leaders, families, ethnic groups, and religions. The Roman Empire fell in the 5th century ce after a succession of barbarian invasions through which Huns, Lombards, Ostrogoths, and Franks—mostly previous subjects of Rome—seized portions of Italy. Rule devolved to the level of the city-state, although the Normans succeeded in establishing a modest empire in southern Italy and Sicily in the 11th century. Many of those city-states flourished during the Renaissance era, a time marked by significant intellectual, artistic, and technological advances but also by savage warfare between states loyal to the pope and those loyal to the Holy Roman Empire.\nItalian unification came in the 19th century, when a liberal revolution installed Victor Emmanuel II as king. In World War I, Italy fought on the side of the Allies, but, under the rule of the fascist leader Benito Mussolini, it waged war against the Allied powers in World War II. From the end of World War II to the early 1990s, Italy had a multiparty system dominated by two large parties: the Christian Democratic Party (Partito della Democrazia Cristiana; DC) and the Italian Communist Party (Partito Comunista Italiano; PCI). In the early 1990s the Italian party system underwent a radical transformation, and the political center collapsed, leaving a right-left polarization of the party spectrum that threw the north-south divide into sharper contrast and gave rise to such political leaders as media magnate Silvio Berlusconi.\nThe whole country is relatively prosperous, certainly as compared with the early years of the 20th century, when the economy was predominantly agricultural. Much of that prosperity has to do with tourism, for in good years nearly as many visitors as citizens can be found in the country. Italy is part of the European Union and the Council of Europe, and, with its strategic geographic position on the southern flank of Europe, it has played a fairly important role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe capital is Rome, one of the oldest of the world’s great cities and a favorite of visitors, who go there to see its great monuments and works of art as well as to enjoy the city’s famed dolce vita, or \"sweet life.\" Other major cities include the industrial and fashion center of Milan; Genoa, a handsome port on the Ligurian Gulf; the sprawling southern metropolis of Naples; and Venice, one of the world’s oldest tourist destinations. Surrounded by Rome is an independent state, Vatican City, which is the seat of the Roman Catholic Church and the spiritual home of Italy’s overwhelmingly Catholic population.

Why did Nazi persecution of the Jews Become more extreme between 1933-1945? When Hitler came into power in January 1933 he set out to implement his ideology which included anti-Semitism and the enforcement of an “Aryan race”. There were many reasons that contributed to the persecution becoming more extreme between 1933 and 1945 such as: The Nuremberg Laws, Kristallnacht, little or no opposition, the Wannsee conference and the idea that Germany should be germanised. The invasion of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland leading to World War 2 were also the reasons why the Nazis put more extreme measures against the Jews in place. To begin with, the Nazis faced relatively little open opposition during their twelve years in power. In private, Germans complained about the regime and its actions. These included refusing to give the Nazi salute, pass on anti-Nazi jokes and rude stories about senior Nazis. Ultimately, this would have made it extremely easy to severely persecute the Jews as there would be no one to rebel or stand against their actions. This was made easier, knowing that Hitler 's close enemies and leaders were executed by his elite bodyguard on 30th June 1934 by the event known as “Night of the long knives”. Source a (OCR, Gcse, Modern world) supports this as it shows soldiers saluting with two hands instead of one, giving the opinion that soldiers were too scared to do anything to oppose him. Hitler having complete control over the army and\nDuring World War Two Germanys Chancellor had a deep hatred towards jews and enforced his beliefs on the people of Germany. They started to also hate all Jews and all Jewish businesses, This was called Anti-Semitism. Hitler started moving Jews into Concentration camps, where they were killed or used for labor. The killing of six-million Jews was the Holocaust. The War Refugee Board back in America had seen that these people were being killed and worked to death. At first they thought that the only way to save them was to win the war as fast as possible. All this changed On June 6, 1944 more than 160,000 troops landed on 50 miles of heavily fortified beaches of Normandy. More than 5,000 ships and 13,000 aircraft supported the men on the ground.\nHow and why did the Nazi treatment of Jews change between the years 1933 and 1945?\nThey were compliant because they were scared that they would be killed if they didn?t obey, but little did they know they were going to get killed anyway.

He vowed to use his skill in public speaking and his position in authority and gain political power the right way.

Italy is part of the European Union and the Council of Europe, and, with its strategic geographic position on the southern flank of Europe, it has played a fairly important role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe capital is Rome, one of the oldest of the world’s great cities and a favorite of visitors, who go there to see its great monuments and works of art as well as to enjoy the city’s famed dolce vita, or \"sweet life.\" Other major cities include the industrial and fashion center of Milan; Genoa, a handsome port on the Ligurian Gulf; the sprawling southern metropolis of Naples; and Venice, one of the world’s oldest tourist destinations. Surrounded by Rome is an independent state, Vatican City, which is the seat of the Roman Catholic Church and the spiritual home of Italy’s overwhelmingly Catholic population. Each of those cities, and countless smaller cities and towns, has retained its differences against the leveling effect of the mass media and standardized education.

Thus, many Italians, particularly older ones, are inclined to think of themselves as belonging to families, then neighborhoods, then towns or cities, then regions, and then, last, as members of a nation.\nThe intellectual and moral faculties of humankind have found a welcome home in Italy, one of the world’s most important centers of religion, visual arts, literature, music, philosophy, culinary arts, and sciences. Michelangelo, the painter and sculptor, believed that his work was to free an already existing image; Giuseppe Verdi heard the voices of the ancients and of angels in music that came to him in his dreams; Dante forged a new language with his incomparable poems of heaven, hell, and the world between.

In an effort to stimulate a discourse, I’ve put together a lot of posts on this web as a precursor to a book I’m writing on this topic (bounce around to follow the journey), as well as put an annotated bibliography together for social workers to learn about/consider how futures frameworks might enhance our practice. I built a game for social work educators , and have done a number of presentations to social workers nationally on features of futures thinking/practice and introduced how these models might increase our impact. On my sabbatical next year, I’m also excited about the chance to put a “social work futures” course together. I’m grateful that CSWE saw fit to explore this issue in the last few years as well with a special task force on the topic.\nAs much fun as it can be to learn about essential futures frameworks as a starting point, it is also important to focus in on WHERE social work is most urgently needed in spaces where in many respects, the future is being “decided,” “developed” and “deployed.” What does it mean that these evolutions are in play without us (and the values/skills we bring) and we are not participating nor contributing in a major way?\nHere are some starting places where the future is being developed that may/may not (sadly often do not) include social work voices/presence. These are places where SOCIAL WORKERS BELONG!! We are learning that we may not always be invited…so sometimes we just have to invite ourselves and begin contributing. Given how “interdisciplinary” these sectors are, so far, folks I know who have been engaged have found these spaces to be welcoming of our ideas, methods, values and presence. So jump in – here’s some ideas!!\n- Tech for social good hackathons\n- Social enterprise and the role of the private sector in social good\n- Algorithmic transparency, justice and bias work as the evolution of social justice/anti-racism work*\n- Universal guaranteed income and the future of the economy/alternative economic models\n- Smart cities and democracy*\n- The future of work and how to transition vulnerable workers to it\n- Technology access as a human right*\n- Use of big data for social good* (including in policy-making and/or helping communities have access to interpreting/using big data for their own purposes)\n- Development, testing and/or evaluation of apps for mental health and/or other social determinants of health, family well-being, etc.*\n- Technology and health – including access to more equitable distribution of access to health resources, tech-related supports for disabilities, state of the art treatments, etc.*\n- Immigration/relocation issues – relevant to both international immigration/relocation as well as climate change related relocation\n- Disaster/emergency preparedness work\n- Use of technology for community organizing and the future of democracy*\n- Each and every practice area we work in is also on a path to its own “future” – for example, the future of child welfare practice, the future of mental health practice, the future of addictions practice, the future of interpersonal violence, the future of aging practice, the future of homelessness, the future of anti-racism practice and on and on and on. At the VERY least, each of us has an ethical responsibility to learn to track and engage in guiding how our issues are conceptualized, reinforced with best practice, aided by tech where possible, and improved.\n- Futures/foresight learning spaces – like the “foresight practitioner” training offered through the Institute for the Future where I’ve just become a research fellow.

The folks who are currently doing social work in these spaces are our guides – but as a whole, I believe we need to do a lot to elevate, celebrate and study their work to grow both their impact and those that will learn from and follow them. IF YOU ARE A SOCIAL WORKER OR SOCIAL WORK ACADEMIC WORKING OR DOING RESEARCH IN THIS SPACE – please get in touch. I’d love to highlight your work in what I’m gathering, add you to my growing data base and “boost your signal” to others in our field!!\nBut I also want to suggest (supportively as well as with a critique) that these topics are seldom covered in a meaningful way in our social work curricula. We need to move more quickly to meet and create the future that we want to see. Our “gaze” needs to lift up to observe, imagine, challenge and move into new spaces, new opportunities with new allies and partners if we hope to have impact in the ways we envision. The world is changing quickly – are we ready?\nDoc 4(Title: \"My Future in Social Work - SocialWorker.com\") Journey to Success\nby Liesel Hauge\nWhen I was a senior in high school, adults would ask me one single question that would send a stab or terror into my heart: What are you majoring in? My answer would always be: I don’t know yet. The terror and pressure to figure out my life’s course before I graduated high school, or worse, entered college, was constant. I toured job fairs, talked to counselors, and took aptitude tests. Nothing stuck out to me.\nThen, one day I realized my passion for social justice. I wanted be the person who would help people who were down on their luck to change their lives, whether that meant working with alcoholics or abused children or the dying. With this in mind, I declared my major to be Social Work. Over the next several months, I reached out to as many professional social workers as I could, including my next door neighbor, friends’ parents, and volunteers at my high school. Their stories showed their massive dedication to their work, and the people they helped both inspired and intimidated me. One woman told me about one of her clients who she helped fight addiction who had relapsed and died the previous weekend. Another person told me about helping a family cope with the dementia of their grandmother. Neither of these testimonials was a happy story, but through these stories I learned about the struggles and dedication that it takes to be a social worker. These people embody the traits that I someday hope to demonstrate as well through my work serving others.\nAs a freshman in college with two Intro to Social Work classes under my belt, I do not know if this is the major for me. However, I am ready to challenge myself, learn as much as I can, and push myself to see if I have what it takes to become a social worker.\nLiesel Hauge is a student at the University of North Dakota.\nDoc 5(Title: \"12 Grand Challenges for Social Work - University of Nevada Reno\") rom institutions — and find effective ways to decrease the number of individuals going to prison, while offering sufficient solutions for overall public safety.\n11.

About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nFour Major Gases That Contribute to the Greenhouse Effect\n-\nCarbon Dioxide\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\n-\nMethane\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\n-\nNitrous Oxide\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\n-\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature – they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\n-\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nAnother Gas That Contributes to the Greenhouse Effect:\n-\nWater Vapor\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change.\nCredit: John Fowler on Unsplash -\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nHuman Activity Is the Cause of Increased Greenhouse Gas Concentrations\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cr\nDoc 4(Title: \"Why is climate change happening and what are the causes ...\") Tropical storms becoming more severe due to warmer ocean water temperatures. • As temperatures rise there is less snowpack in mountain ranges and polar areas and the snow melts faster. • Overall, glaciers are melting at a faster rate...\nDoes the USGS monitor global warming?

Determining a person’s Capacity is a key to determining proportionate services. I have applied this knowledge in a number of cases including; KJ, aged 70 and LD aged 93, who both could not make decisions pertaining to their care needs. I ensured that I worked in a person-centered way when working with service users and their families. However, one of the cases that was allocated to me challenged my personal values. The service user’s family members were in a same-sex relationship however as a social worker one needs to be sensitive to the views and opinions of your customers by treating them with respect and being non-judgmental in accordance with Equality Act 2010. So I had to let my professional values override my personal values, because to work in an anti-oppressive manner, I need to understand different groups by listening to their views, feelings and address their needs (KSS 1). In summary, the learning gained from the last three months has honed my skills and prepared me for the final part of the ASYE programme. I have had varied cases which have given me different experiences in the Adult Social Care. Having regular supervision was a good way of my supervisor monitoring my progress and also giving me the opportunity to discuss any difficulty that I was experiencing and seeking support in those areas. Communicating my difficulties as and when they happen with my supervisor and team has also built my skills and encouraged me to work with other professionals using their expertise to further my knowledge. I am aware that by the end of the ASYE programme, I should be able to manage complex cases and safeguarding cases like my colleagues in my team. My practice has persistently been guided by the Care Act 2014, MCA 2005, HCPC, Equality Act 2010, Data Protection Act 1998 and Human Rights 1998. References Beresford, P., & Branfield, F. (2006).

And, you know, I think that my experience of raising my brothers and sisters, certainly my daughter benefitted from that, because I kind of knew a little bit more about what I was doing when I got to that.\nLUDDEN: Kathy Borkowski, the director of the Wisconsin Historical Society Press, she joined us from Wisconsin Public Radio in Madison. Thank you so much.\nBORKOWSKI: Thank you.\nLUDDEN: And we'll be back, talking about siblings raising siblings, the good and the bad, with Vicki Panaccione, child clinical psychologist and founder of the Better Parenting Institute. If you raised brothers and sisters or were raised by them, give us a call: 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org.\nBack in just a moment. I'm Jennifer Ludden. This is TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nLUDDEN: This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Jennifer Ludden. Parents take care of a million things that kids, if they're lucky, are never aware of, from the big - paying for the roof over everyone's heads - to the small - a lost tooth magically transformed into a dollar bill. It's hard to overstate their role.\nAnd when children lose their parents to the prison system or illness or addiction, so many of those responsibilities can fall to the older kids. So how does that change dynamic, older sibling and younger to caregiver and child, influence them later in life? If you were raised by a sibling, or if you raised your brother or sister, tell us your story at 800-989-8255. Or send us an email, talk@npr.org, and you can join the conversation online. Go to npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION.\nVicki Panaccione, a child clinical psychologist and the founder of the Better Parenting Institute, is my guest. And I'm going to bring a caller into the line right now. Lisa in Peoria, hi there.\nLISA: Hi. How are you doing, Jennifer?\nLUDDEN: We are good, thank you. Tell us about your story.\nLISA: Well my sister, she was 17 at the time, and she was raising myself, which I was 15, I had a brother Ricky who was 12, Kedrick(ph) 11, and Jason he was five.\nLUDDEN: Wow, that's a lot.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLISA: Yes, my mother, she died of lupus, and she had to, basically, she was sick for about three years, and they gave her six months to live, but six months, but she lived for three years. And my sister had to bathe her, feed her, dress her. She was on oxygen. And so she was paying bills and cooking and cleaning at the age of 14.\nAnd just like in times, my brother, he - my youngest brother used to wake us up - well, we used to wake him up for school, and he used to tell us, well, I'm hungry. And we said, well, go fix your own food. And he'd get a chair and put it against the stove, and he'll fry eggs and bacon at the age of five.\nAnd I'm looking back, and I couldn't believe it. And my - he also, another thing I remember is that because we live on the country, and they used to hunt a lot. And he used to - and so my mother had some rifles and stuff, and so he used to take these rifles, and he used to go hunting at five.\nLUDDEN: Oh my goodness. And you all didn't stop him.\nLISA: We didn't know. And so my uncle came along, and he took the guns away, and so later on, when he turned 14, he asked for his mother's guns. And so my uncle looked at him because they were kind of antique and stuff, and so - and he gave them to him. But he was so responsible.\nWe took diapers off of him, and as soon as we took the diaper off, he was trained. He never wet the bed. And so he was always the little man. He must have knew he had to grow up quick.\nLUDDEN: Now what about you, Lisa? How did it affect you, do you think?\nLISA: Well, it affected me, but I didn't have her pressure because I went off to college. And then later on in life, after I graduated, I had to give my siblings allowances. I had to buy the car. I had to pay their insurance. And so I really didn't have time to just basi\nDoc 3(Title: \"Introduction - Development During Middle Childhood - NCBI ...\") es, the following sections serve as background to the analyses of children's development in the remainder of this report.\nSeveral limitations on the type and scope of information presented should be made clear at the outset. First, despite repeated calls for an integrated system of childhood social indicators that tracks the welfare of children in this country, such a system has yet to be developed. Data based on sources with long histories, such as the Current Population Survey, are a major source of information about population trends, the types of families in which children are growing up, and the schools they attend. Less is known, at least from a national perspective, about the quality of children's lives and their perceptions of their worlds. Several recent studies, such as the National Survey of Children (Zill, in press), have begun to fill this gap. Nevertheless, we have only a rudimentary understanding of children's own views of their lives.\nBesides the relative scarcity of certain types of information, other limitations mark these data. For our purposes the preferable unit of analysis is the child. The following sections reflect this preference, but in many cases information in which the family is the unit of analysis was the only kind available. In addition, data are most frequently reported in broad age categories that are not consistent across data sources or over time. Whenever possible, we report information on children between the ages of 6 and 12. Often, however, data were available only on expanded age groupings, such as 5-13 or 6-13.\nA hallmark of these data is the diversity of the population of children in middle childhood. National averages often mask important differences between subgroups—racial differences and regional differences, for example—and national surveys often inadequately report information about minority groups (Zill et al., 1983). In this overview we focus on racial differences because of the frequently striking contrast between white and black children in our society. We recognize, however, that the presentation of data would be facilitated by further disaggregation into more finely differentiated subgroups. We also recognize the need for information on children ages 6-12 in other cultural and minority groups in the United States, particularly Asian-American, Hispanic, and Native American groups.\nThe Population of School-Age Children\nIn 1982 the population of U.S. children ages 6-12 was 23.6 million, representing slightly more than 10 percent of the total U.S. population of 232 million. This age group is approximately equally divided by sex (51 percent were boys, 49 percent were girls). Of the total number of children, 15 percent were black. Relative to children of all ages, a higher proportion of black children (12.6 percent) than white children (9.7 percent) were between the ages of 6 and 12.\nCurrent data are not available for racial and ethnic group breakdowns of children ages 6-12. These data are published, however, for children ages 5-13 or 5-14 (see Table 1-1). Table 1-1 presents the number of children in six racial and ethnic groups and their proportion in the population and provides additional data on children of Hispanic origin.\nThe proportion of all children in middle childhood has been steadily declining during the past two decades. In 1960 children ages 6-12, part of the postwar baby boom, represented slightly less than 16 percent of the population; by 1970 they represented 14.1 percent. With the simultaneous rise in the average life expectancy, the population on average has been gradually getting older.\nCensus Bureau projections estimate that the population of children ages 6-12 as well as the percentage of the population ages 6-12 will continue to decline through 1985. Their number will then gradually increase through the remainder of this century before once again declining in the beginning of the twenty-first century.\nChildren's Environments\nThe racial and cultural diversit\nDoc 4(Title: \"Chapter 17: Cognitive Development in Middle Childhood ...\") igence in real-world pursuits: The role of tacit knowledge.

So, as is almost always the case where complex aspects of behavior are concerned, both individual factors (including, perhaps, temperament) and environmental factors play important roles.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Negative Effects of Doping in Sports (essay sample ...\") monstrate high psychological support.\nLooking at the above mentioned issues that may cause depression, it is necessary to mention the appropriate treatment that will be helpful in diagnosing addicted athletes and their mental recovery. There are four main methods to treat them: family therapy, medications, behavioural approach and psychoanalysis. Family therapy does not demand all family members participate in the session. At the first stage, it is vital to establish therapeutic relationships between a mental specialist and family members. For instance, an effective approach is to interview family members separately, to identify the patient, and then siblings. It is highly recommended that parents express their opinions and emotions freely when children do not participate in the psychoanalytical session. Children should also express their feelings freely without a fear that their parents may punish them. Consequently, parents and children will be ready to accept family therapy and show willingness to discuss their problems. At this stage, it is vital to establish credibility and belief in the effectiveness of the family therapy.\nMoreover, another good example of treatment of depression is the application of medication that is determined as a helpful method (Docherty 3). In the application of medication, it is necessary to control the dose of drugs, taking into consideration the structure of the body and weight. Additionally, the behavioural approach analyzes the direct behaviour of athlete, explores their cultural and social experience, and determines main reasons that have led to depression. In this case, psychiatrist should ask many questions, create a convenient atmosphere (play silent music and use comfortable furniture), build trustworthy relationships, and not limit a person in expressing his/her emotions. Furthermore, it is evident that a new stage of imperialism, known as globalization leads not only to the global democracy, the development of education, a rapid transfer of information, professional medical care and the exchange of experience, but also to the uncontrollable changes in mass communication, transportation, and development in computer technologies.\nStiglitz (17) illustrates the above mentioned information by the notion of total changes of social landscape of the world. People have more possibilities to buy what they want and use it how they want. Thus, the access to the banned substances is almost unlimited. A person needs only money. Undoubtedly, rapid development of technologies, cross-border relationship and immigration significantly influenced the beginning of the new era, known as a new qualitatively economic development. Free access to what humans want can be clarified by Thomas Friedman, NY Times journalist and Pulitzer Prize winning author, who mentioned that today globalization is cheaper, deeper, farther and faster (Stiglitz 45). Consequently, modern changes have deteriorated all spheres of human life. The process of controlling globalization has been always in the centre of heated debates. The elite officials of countries and their opponents point out that the process of globalization is absolutely unpredictable and uncontrollable. Teenagers and adults are uncontrollable; moreover, they have become addicted of this free excess. In this case, modern legislative system should apply various laws in order to solve this controversial issue. Undoubtedly, mandatory drug testing is identified as unethical means, since it violates sportsman’s rights. This notion can be amplified by the fact that western directions to freedom and privacy are totally misunderstood in the modern governmental systems. In this case, an athlete can freely use performance-enhancing drugs, with the full understanding of the possible results. However, the testing should be applied in case when there is a strong possibility to harm people and oneself. Moreover, every athlete has a choice to use or not these enhancing drugs.\nMost o\nDoc 5(Title: \"An example of critical reflection log (log 4): Reflection on learning\") s the capacity to make decisions until proven otherwise.

Furthermore, it is evident that a new stage of imperialism, known as globalization leads not only to the global democracy, the development of education, a rapid transfer of information, professional medical care and the exchange of experience, but also to the uncontrollable changes in mass communication, transportation, and development in computer technologies.\nStiglitz (17) illustrates the above mentioned information by the notion of total changes of social landscape of the world. People have more possibilities to buy what they want and use it how they want. Thus, the access to the banned substances is almost unlimited. A person needs only money. Undoubtedly, rapid development of technologies, cross-border relationship and immigration significantly influenced the beginning of the new era, known as a new qualitatively economic development. Free access to what humans want can be clarified by Thomas Friedman, NY Times journalist and Pulitzer Prize winning author, who mentioned that today globalization is cheaper, deeper, farther and faster (Stiglitz 45). Consequently, modern changes have deteriorated all spheres of human life. The process of controlling globalization has been always in the centre of heated debates. The elite officials of countries and their opponents point out that the process of globalization is absolutely unpredictable and uncontrollable. Teenagers and adults are uncontrollable; moreover, they have become addicted of this free excess. In this case, modern legislative system should apply various laws in order to solve this controversial issue. Undoubtedly, mandatory drug testing is identified as unethical means, since it violates sportsman’s rights. This notion can be amplified by the fact that western directions to freedom and privacy are totally misunderstood in the modern governmental systems. In this case, an athlete can freely use performance-enhancing drugs, with the full understanding of the possible results. However, the testing should be applied in case when there is a strong possibility to harm people and oneself. Moreover, every athlete has a choice to use or not these enhancing drugs.\nMost o\nDoc 5(Title: \"An example of critical reflection log (log 4): Reflection on learning\") s the capacity to make decisions until proven otherwise. Determining a person’s Capacity is a key to determining proportionate services. I have applied this knowledge in a number of cases including; KJ, aged 70 and LD aged 93, who both could not make decisions pertaining to their care needs. I ensured that I worked in a person-centered way when working with service users and their families. However, one of the cases that was allocated to me challenged my personal values. The service user’s family members were in a same-sex relationship however as a social worker one needs to be sensitive to the views and opinions of your customers by treating them with respect and being non-judgmental in accordance with Equality Act 2010. So I had to let my professional values override my personal values, because to work in an anti-oppressive manner, I need to understand different groups by listening to their views, feelings and address their needs (KSS 1). In summary, the learning gained from the last three months has honed my skills and prepared me for the final part of the ASYE programme. I have had varied cases which have given me different experiences in the Adult Social Care. Having regular supervision was a good way of my supervisor monitoring my progress and also giving me the opportunity to discuss any difficulty that I was experiencing and seeking support in those areas. Communicating my difficulties as and when they happen with my supervisor and team has also built my skills and encouraged me to work with other professionals using their expertise to further my knowledge. I am aware that by the end of the ASYE programme, I should be able to manage complex cases and safeguarding cases like my colleagues in my team.

If we go on without change, the consequences will be devastating for millions of Americans and disastrous for the nation in human and economic terms.” Hillary Rodham Clinton, 1994.\nToday millions of Americans cannot afford the sufficient healthcare they need. Politicians, experts, and health care providers have warned for more than four decades that the American health care system was “poised on the verge of a … meltdown” (Flood 200). Constant concerns about the state of the health care system produced many promises from presidents and congressional officials to change this situation, but brought few positive results. Today, it is clear that state governments should be the principal source of policy innovation in health care that will provide the public with sufficient healthcare. Government should ensure that every citizen, naturalized citizen, and alien resident is entitled to basic level or “core” health care benefits (Daniels 1). It should also be a basic premise of that system that every citizen who is able to pay toward those health care services should do so. A major argument of this paper is that government alone has the ultimate responsibility for the health care of its community and not business or industry.\nGovernment Regulation and the Health Care System\nGovernment should provide health care to all citizens regardless of their ability to pay for that care. There are different ways of expressing the basic moral demand for sufficient health care as due. First, people have a right to health care that they can claim against the government. Second, the governments have responsibility to provide health care that will generate commitment to social solidarity. As one of the leading proponents of a just, easily accessible, and universal care system, Norman Daniels, has claimed, “by keeping people close to normal functioning, health care preserves for people the ability to participate in the political, social, and economic life of their society” (Daniels 1). To this one can add the right to participate in the family and private life of communities. The idea in Daniels’s vision of health care is that of a “fair equality of opportunity” (Daniels 3).\nThe concept of state health care to all citizens is strong in Canada and Western Europe. The governments focus on the need of the citizens living together to support and help one another. The governments provide health and social resources necessary for people to function as a community (McDonough 160). The main focus is on the needs of the people living in one country. Guaranteed access to health care is meant to locate the citizens within a community and produce a communal and not just a private good.\nThe fundamental principle of the state health care is simply stated. It is that affordable, high-quality health care should be available to all citizens without financial barriers to access. There are a variety of regulation forms through which the principle may be implemented. For example, a tax-based public service as in the UK or the Nordic countries, tax-financed insurance as in Canada, or legally required obligatory social insurance as in Germany. In their different ways all three forms of state organization can be considered as compatible with the principle of comprehensive, high-quality healthcare available to all who need medical help.\nResponsibility for managing the organization and delivery of health care should rest wholly on the shoulders of state governments. Constantly increasing competition in the modern health care industry has changed the role of the governments. It rearranged health care advocacy coalitions and interests, and made existing government policy tools obsolete or less me\nDoc 2(Title: \"Should government provide health care essay | Examples and ...\") The issue of health care is one of the most important aspects of an election campaign of any political party, which certainly reflects the extent to what the society depends on a good healthcare service. A well-organized, efficient health care system is not that easy to provide and one of the key problems on the way to the ideal hospitals and medical help is proper funding. Nowadays, there are three basic types of funding: private, insurance and state. Nevertheless, many people believe that the government must bear full responsibility for providing the money our health care service needs. However, I do not completely agree with the idea.\nThe government will not be able to provide enough money to guarantee the use of the most innovative methods of treatment. It is not a secret that medicine and medical equipment are outrageously expensive. Moreover, government has several branches of the social sector, such as education and culture, which also do not produce anything, but need funding. Providing enough money for all these spheres will sooner or later result in the budget deficit and, as a result, in the increase of taxes, which means that the main financial burden is on an average citizen again.\nIn my opinion, an ideal variant will be a combination of all the existing sources of finance. Some rich people may prefer to pay for medical treatment, while the government must necessarily subsidize the health care for children, senior citizens, the unemployed and the homeless, as these social groups cannot provide for themselves and, thus, are extremely financially vulnerable. However, working adults can use the benefits of the medical insurance, which will give them an opportunity for a decent medical service and reduce the general taxation burden.\nDoc 3(Title: \"The Government Should Provide Health Care | Blablawriting.com\") working poor (Bauman 219). Government can also impose a mandatory budget cap on health care expenditures. In both examples, government officials are not just passive observers of market competition. Instead, they are channel and direct market forces in pursuit of public goals (for example, controlling Medicaid costs).\nThe primary funding for the health care can be accomplished through a Government Health Care Fund. The funds for this heath care program is derived and provided to the Fund in the following manner (Bauman 251):\n- Employer contribution equal to 3 percent of the gross earnings of each wage or salaried employee.\n- Employee contribution of 7 percent of gross earnings, with no upper limit.\n- A 1 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on all consumer durables produced in the home country or imported from foreign nations.\n- For each dollar of foreign aid granted to any foreign government or nation 0.001 percent of such amounts will be provided to the Health Care Fund for national health care.\nUniversal Coverage\nIf any kind of universal coverage is adopted, the costs are large in size and require all citizens to both contribute to the government health care system and contribute to the reduction of the national debt. If health care is absolutely “de-linked” from the workplace and the government makes a social contract with individuals for their own health care, business and industry can go about doing what they should do-making a high quality product at the lowest possible price, while providing a reasonable rate of return to investors (Crichton and Robertson 142). In this case, a government health care plan will stand or fall on the willingness of individuals to pay their fair share of the costs for the received health care.\nThe Role of Government in Health Care\nThe following aspects of health care need to be put into focus:\n- Patients’ incentives should probably be reweighed by subjecting every lab test, visit to a medical office or clinic, or other item of medical service to a “deductible” (Chapman 36).\n- Governments need to bar “punitive” damage claims for malpractice. Careful estimations must be required for “substantive” damage claims (Crichton and Robertson 57).\n- Governments need to control litigiousness. For example, in the United States it is far worse than in other countries (Havighurst and Richman 10).\n- Governments urgently need legislative reform to control the authority of such interest groups as health insurers and health providers (Havighurst and Richman 10).\nConclusion\nThe unsuccessful attempts to enact national health care since early in the century were the result of constant constraints on reorganizing the financing and delivery of health care. Health care has historically been fixed in fee-for-service physician care and the prevalence of voluntary hospitals. Further, the health care system was extremely transformed in the post-war period by the rapid growth of private health insurance. However, except for tax subvention, the government played no direct role in public health care until the passage of Medicare and Medicaid.\nToday, the governments should take a lead role in the reform of the current health care system. The governments have residual responsibility for the provision of essential health care to all of their citizens. Government, not companies, should provide health care. The goal of transferring full responsibility to government might prove effective. A completely government-controlled health care system could provide basic health care services to the entire population. Government provision of adequate health care for the whole population produces commitment to social justice and a sense of solidarity and mutual dependence among the population.\nReferences\nBauman, Robert E. (1995). “Can Government Run a Health Care System?” USA Today. Vol. 123, no. 2596.\nChapman, Audrey R. (1994). Health Care Reform: A Human Rights Approach. Georgetown University Press: Washington, DC.\nCrichton, Anne and Robertson\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Government Should Provide Health Care | Blablawriting.com\") alth care should rest wholly on the shoulders of state governments. Constantly increasing competition in the modern health care industry has changed the role of the governments. It rearranged health care advocacy coalitions and interests, and made existing government policy tools obsolete or less meaningful. The public remains anxious about efforts to reduce subscriber utilization of inpatient hospital care and specialist services as a means of controlling costs (Chapman 14). The growing use of restrictive managed care arrangements by insurers has generated new concerns about the quality of care provided to the elderly, the poor, and patients who require costly treatments (McDonough 180). Under these circumstances, enacting comprehensive health care reform at the government level is necessary for coping with the dramatic changes in the organization and financing of health care.\nInsurance and the Government\nWithin all societies, the governments should assume responsibility for assuring medical care for all citizens. On the one hand, some members of society may not have sufficient means to insure themselves. On the other hand, if they have sufficient resources, they may suffer a form of myopia that means they allocate not adequate resources to cover their health care needs. One solution here can be to blanket in these difficult cases by socializing insurance either through the tax system, as in Canada, or through a system of non-profit sickness funds based on compulsory membership, as in Germany (McDonough 342).\nInsurance services would be produced more efficiently if they were produced by the governments. It is indicated that the government provides some insurance benefits at a lower unit administrative cost than the private markets would be able to provide them. For example, Flood (2000, p.1154) makes that point in the consideration of the Polish social insurance system. It is true that the government can nationalize medical care, make it universal, impose the same benefit scales on every citizen and then administer the system more cheaply than the private markets would do. Government may develop sufficient range of insurance products that may appear to add value because they can be adapted to suit individual needs.\nAssurances from the government to the members of the medical profession and the leaders of the voluntary hospital sector can improve access to the health care system for two seriously disadvantaged groups, the elderly and the poor. All conditions of medical care delivery would remain under professional control and guidance.\nResponsibility for providing health care services to the uninsured and underinsured should rest evidently with state government. For example, in the case of the poor, Congress created Medicaid: the government became the principal payer. This initiative designed a system of universal coverage for their residents. Both Medicare and Medicaid have had success making easier for the states to cover incremental expenditures incurred in treating increasing numbers of the poor and the uninsured. Medicare has also made it easier for rural hospitals and physicians that are in difficulties to increase their revenues and earnings, thereby helping them continue to provide sufficient health care to the rural population.\nFunding the Government Health Care\nThe government actively promotes competition as a means of controlling costs and increasing access to health care. Medicaid managed care waivers, for instance, can be used to considerably expand access to health care for individuals without health insurance by plowing cost savings from capitation for program enrollees into state-subsidized insurance programs for the working poor (Bauman 219). Government can also impose a mandatory budget cap on health care expenditures. In both examples, government officials are not just passive observers of market competition. Instead, they are channel and direct market forces in pursuit of public goals (for example, controll\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Government Should Provide Health Care | Blablawriting.com\") and mutual dependence among the population.\nReferences\nBauman, Robert E.

It interrogated and critiqued documents on what other researchers in their different contexts had established in view of the feasibility of outsourcing as a strategy to improve service delivery. It emerged in this study that political interference, lack of citizen participation. lack of funds and corruption were the main causes of poor service delivery in local authorities. Therefore, outsourcing was seen to bring quality and affordable services for the public while costs savings and emergence of hidden costs were the financial implications unveiled for the local authorities (LAs). Social costs, accountability for public service delivery and quality shading were cited to be the outsourcing challenges. It also emerged in this study that outsourcing can increase service quality and provide affordable services for the public. Taking into account the information that was accumulated and examined, the researchers came to the conclusion that the current services being offered by local authorities are very poor and this is attributed to many causes such as political interference, lack of citizen participation, lack of funds and corruption. The study therefore, concludes that outsourcing could be a feasible option to use to improve service delivery by local authorities.\nSuggested Citation\nWadesango N & Mhaka C & Chikomo T & Wadesango V O, 2018.\n\"Causes of Poor Service Delivery and the Feasibility of Outsourcing to Improve Services in Local Authorities,\"\nJournal of Economics and Behavioral Studies, AMH International, vol. 10(2), pages 188-198.\nHandle:\nRePEc:rnd:arjebs:v:10:y:2018:i:2:p:188-198\nDOI: 10.22610/jebs.v10i2(J).2228\nDownload full text from publisher\nCorrections\nAll material on this site has been provided by the respective publishers and authors.

According to ANC spokesperson Jesse Duarte there have been protests in ‘only’ 14 of the 283 municipalities, but other sources put the figure at more than twenty. The strike this week by municipal workers raises fears that dissatisfaction with municipal service delivery may further increase and that this might see a spread in protest action. Many of these protests have also turned violent and there are indications that criminals are exploiting the situation. Incidents of apparent xenophobia were also reported. Groups of foreigners, fearing the kind of attacks that saw 60 foreigners killed in 2008, are again seeking shelter at police stations. In a number of places the police had to use force to stabilise the situation and to restore order. Police action included arrests for looting, public violence and various other crimes.\nMany reasons for these protests are offered. The primary reason, it would appear, is dissatisfaction with the delivery of basic municipal services such as running water, electricity and toilets, especially in informal settlements. Unemployment (officially at around 23%), high levels of poverty, poor infrastructure, and the lack of houses add to the growing dissatisfaction in these and other poor communities. This comes in the wake of political promises during the election period that all or most of these issues will be addressed once the new government is in place. According to some protesters this has been a recurring theme with every elections since 1994. To some extent this claim is supported in an article in 2005 by Prof Nico le Roux from the School of Public Management and Administration at the University of Pretoria, in which he reminds us that the 2004 elections were followed by similar demonstrations in 21 local communities in different parts of the country and for precisely the same reasons. In this regard it is perhaps also worth considering the fact that the South African elections normally takes place in the April/May period, immediately before winter when its harsh realities exacerbate the absence of life’s immediate necessities.\nA number of other reasons for or causes of the public protests are also provided. These include allegations of rampant corruption and nepotism within local government structures. Some protesters blame poor service delivery on the deployment of ANC ‘comrades’ to positions for which they are not qualified. The Minister for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Sicelo Shiceka, speaking to the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) in East London on Wednesday (22 April), admitted that ‘many of our municipalities are in a state of paralysis and dysfunction’. According to the Minister, local government is perceived to be incompetent, disorganised and ‘riddled with corruption and maladministration’. He indicated that, if what they found in North West Province is indicative of the state of municipalities elsewhere in the country, there might be a need to declare a ‘national state of emergency’ on local government.\nIt is necessary, at this stage, to consider the nature and implications of these service delivery protests against allegations of third force involvement and concerns over its revolutionary potential. So far, no evidence of a third force could be produced, but it may still be useful to consider the revolutionary potential of widespread public discontent and violent acts of protest.\nJames Davies, an American sociologist, in a 1962 article titled ‘Towards a Theory of Revolution’ theorised about rising expectations and the likelihood of armed conflict. His theory became known as the Davies J-curve, a model that attempts to explain the position where the pace of an individual’s reality is no\nDoc 5(Title: \"Causes of Poor Service Delivery in Africa and Their Impact ...\") Making sure you're not a bot!\nLoading...\nWhy am I seeing this?\nYou are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites.

Racial discrimination has always been a serious social problem. Racial discrimination is further convinced that the disaggregated differences are linked to hierarchical evaluations, and that various human races determine their culture or personal achievement, implying that certain races are better than others. Racism to the German Nazi regime and the United States as the representation of the past, the German Nazi regime\nThe United States is considered one of the countries that have more immigrants in the world. Also, is considered as one of the countries that treat their population equally. According to Teresa Welsh, in 2013 North America has 989,900 immigrants, leading the U.S to be the top country for having more migrants. However, immigrants are facing discrimination and racism in this country.\nIntroduction Racial discrimination is defined as “when a person is treated less favorably than another person in a similar situation because of their race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin or immigrant status” (Thomas). Racial discrimination in the workplace is a real problem in our world today. Not only is it against the Constitution, but it is morally and ethically wrong. Throughout history, many people have fought for equality among races, and the fact that racism is still an issue in our country today is proof that the United States still has a lot to change. Racism is an issue that has been going on in our country since slavery first began in the United States in 1619 (Slavery). That’s over 400 years ago. Racism is prevalent in many workplaces, and those who are in the minority experience inequality through payment, promotion, and treatment.\nThe more we comprehend our self, our social location and the nature and history of power, oppression, and prejudice, the more we will be able to identify and react racism and discrimination when we see it. The harsh truth is that racism is something we learn not something we were born with, it’s very serious issues and shouldn’t be ignored, we should never try and hide our identity in fear of being discriminated, the good news is that no matter where we are there will always be support for us. Just make sure we look in the right places.\nSo here are the facts: According to national poll commissioned by the Episcopal Church 98% of Americans feel that there is some type of discrimination still alive in America today. 7/10 Americans feel that African Americans are directly discriminated against. But it can happen to anyone whichever race. Journal Science states that “Many people unconsciously harbor racist attitudes. But is that an excuse for hostility?\nAfrican-Americans are using drugs less than Caucasian, but amazingly are 6 times more likely to be stopped and searched for them.The drug percentage is about 5.8% for African-Americans and 10.5% for caucasians, and the search rate is 45/1000 African-American and 7/1000 caucasians. Many people are still being racist and because of color, a style, sexual orientation, or what you may have. You're put in a group classified on these things and are judged on by the world. Racism and discrimination is happening and it needs to stop. From Jobs, stereotypes, and the system, racism and discrimination still live.\nI: People from different backgrounds around the world are being targeted and discriminated by individuals of other races solely because they are different racially and culturally.\nCivil rights activist Al Sharpton said, “We have come a long way from the days of slavery, but in 2014, discrimination and inequality still saturate our society in modern ways”. This quote rings true where equality in the workplace is concerned. In Toni Cade Bambara’s short story “The Lesson”, we see what social discrimination looks like through the eyes of children who are observing a wealthier part of town. In their eyes, they see and injustice and question why it is not being altered into something centered more on equality and equal opportunity. Toni\nDoc 2(Title: \"The Problem of Racial Discrimination - Free Essay Example ...\") Racism has been a constant issue today as it was many years ago. Throughout history many groups have been labeled and criticized not only for the race, but for their sex and class as well. People of lower class being criticized for not having economical means to afford common goods. Blacks being put down for their color. The federal government should be the one to initiate a national movement against racism. Although, this cannot be done alone, those in authority and society also play a huge role in this movement.\nJudgement about other individuals should be considered before expressing yourself outloud. Sometimes with a simple decision your are making you can be committing unconscious bias. According to the article Unconscious Bias, When good intentions aren’t good enough, by Sarah E,. Fiarman, “a growing body of research shows that we all harbor unconscious bias.” Bringing forward this sort of unconscious bias begins to promote an unpleasant environment for those being targeted. For instance, teachers carry a role with greater responsibilities of not expressing or showing such bias towards anyone based of their skin color, ethnicity, language, and other traits. Still teachers have demonstrated quite the opposite. (indirect quote) “Educators, he told me, frequently notice misbehavior among black students while ignoring the same behavior among white students.” qtd Unconscious bias article. If students of color are experiencing these prejudiced acts at an early age how can we expect them to develop a positive attitude towards people in authority later in life. When all they have received is racial discrimination.\nThe only way we can begin by preventing such issues is starting a national movement that will help bring racism to an end. This national movement can implement a measure to bring awareness of unconscious bias in school and steps to eliminate barriers ensuring groups and individuals being targeted are being more effectively addressed. Now, this can obviously not only be done through the federal government. Solve this unconscious bias by beginning with the staff then spreading the knowledge through schools and into public mindset. Predominantly the lack of implementing this idea can very well be the downfall of this movement. Although, many might think they’re completely unbiased, it is important to recognize and prevent any act of implicit bias.\nImagine being told to go back to your country because you speak spanish. Even worse, being pushed aside by your own friends at such a young age because of your skin color. Well this is happening everyday all around the world. As Gayle Kirshenbaum explains, “This was not the first time she’d seen her child, the only child of color in a playground, excluded in this way - an exclusion that was not noticed or challenged by the attendant white parents.” They say we must lead by example, so how can we expect to bring racism to an end when there isn’t anything being done when moments like these are being encountered.quote: , “Nearly 800,000 students are enrolled in schools where more than 20 percent of teachers have not met certification or license requirements. Black, Latino and American Indian or Alaska Native students are more likely to attend these schools.” A person's skin tone or race shouldn’t define where they will be put, everyone should be treated equally.\nHow do you get your child to understand it is not okay to be racist when all they have encountered has been discrimination. A national movement can implement measures to ensure that individuals and groups facing racial discrimination have access to any place or service intended for public use, such as schools, educations, and parks. Initiate by defining the current situation and articulating a comprehensive program of activities aimed at bringing improvement. This ensures concerns of individuals facing racial discrimination that measures are being taken. Not only that but eventually it will promote mutual understanding among\nDoc 3(Title: \"The Problem of Racial Discrimination - 1578 Words | Bartleby\") Assignment 2 Introduction Throughout the course of time, racial discrimination has been a part of the challenges facing all societies. This is because various groups in society began to spend increasing amounts of time working with individuals that shared similar ideas and characteristics as themselves. Over the course of time, this created various feelings about one group over that of the other. At the same time, feelings of jealousy and resentment fueled animosity between racial groups. Evidence of these kinds of distinctions is going back to some of the earliest accounts in the Bible with the Jews enslaved and escaping from slavery in Egypt. The reason why they were slaves is because the Jews were seen as inferior to the ancients Egyptians. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, many of the biologically based racial issues were brought to the forefront with the elimination of regimes that supported these kinds of practices (such as: Apartheid in South Africa). (Fredrickson, 2003, pp. 49 105) This is significant, in showing how a transformation is taking place in how society is looking at racism and the ideas of personal responsibility. To fully understand what is happening requires: examining the historical foundations of racism, how it is defined by society, the different social categories, how society has changed, recommending two ideas for improving an individual's social situation and the methods of sociological research that can be applied to these recommendations.\nImmigrants came over searching for the opportunity to have social, political, and religious freedom in America. America was a blissful place of freedom where people of all races could live harmoniously, have an abundance of opportunities while working to build the framework for this country. The United States began coining terms such as ‘the land of the free’, ‘the melting pot’ and ‘the American dream’. The term was first established by James Adams in a book titled ‘Epic of America’, where he defines the american dream as, \"that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of\nThree white employees (Lynette, Barret, W.T. Melton, and Treva Nickens) file suit against Whirlpool Corp. The plaintiffs (Lynette, Barret, W.T. Melton, and Treva Nickens) (Lynette, Barret, W.T. Melton, and Treva Nickens) alleged race-discriminated in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and §1981 and retaliation in violation of Title VII, based on befriending with and advocacy on behalf of their African-American co-workers. The plaintiffs (Lynette, Barret, W.T. Melton, and Treva Nickens) also claimed they were subject to hostile work environment based on their association with the black employees.\nAs children grow up, they become the person they turn out to be because of experiences and the culture and society they grew up in. Nations are affected in the same sense because the people living in a nation affect how the nation is influenced and builds its character.\nAlmost everyone has heard the famous hymn, “Jesus Loves the Little Children,” but not all understand the true meaning when it says, “Red, and yellow, black, and white, they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves the little children of the world.” The moment sin entered into the world, perfection no longer existed. This loss of perfection changed the way humans viewed each other. It made one ethnicity view another ethnicity as inferior, and in doing so, created what people now know of as racism. For centuries, racism has been a part of society, shaping the way humans view each other, but with the aid of Young Women 's Christian Association (YWCA) - Stand Against Racism, racial discrimination and injustice can be eliminated.\nWe have issues: more specifically , the United States has issues, continuous and all-encompassing issues of racial inequality\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Problem of Racial Discrimination - 1578 Words | Bartleby\") the way humans view each other, but with the aid of Young Women 's Christian Association (YWCA) - Stand Against Racism, racial discrimination and injustice can be eliminated.\nWe have issues: more specifically , the United States has issues, continuous and all-encompassing issues of racial inequality.The United States is experiencing a outburst of racism, as can be seen from the 2014 killings of two unarmed African-American men, to the brutality of white supremacy in Charleston and the string of arsons in black churches across the South. Of course, it’s nothing new for a nation with a long history of extreme racist violence—the most recent lynching-related death occurred in 1981, hardly a lifetime ago, when Michael Donald was hanged by two members of the Ku Klux Klan.The United States, however, continues to avoid its history on race, refusing to confront its past in a “post-racial,” “colorblind” society, and that policy of systemic ignorance is particularly strong when mention of racial equality is brought up. Although the concept of equality has never truly existed in this world, as can be traced back to the very beginnings of recorded history we see the nobles ruling the commoners, conquerors reigning over the conquered, the will of man dominating women; the United States needs to acknowledge the fact that racial inequality still exists within our country and has in no way progressed towards betterment.\nIs the society’s draconian attendance towards the people of distinguishable race a fair measure of precaution or an act of discrimination? In the society we live in today, the enactment of racial bias has made a monumental impact, shaping many individuals ' lives by default. However, is it fair for the innocent individuals to be shrouded with the burden of being a particular ‘race’? After witnessing, the incident of Ferguson, I became dreadfully discontented to discovered that people today have self-established the immense belief that people of color are the primary cause of danger, and therefore, they must be regarded as hazardous creatures. Moreover, the reason triggering the detrimental policing was due to the color of the victims, illustrating the ugly truth of racial profiling still remains intact to our society. Although racial profiling and prejudice are disavowed publicly by Americans, many statistics and research on implicit racial bias debated the citizens of the United States still perceive a person 's physical in determining their likeliness to committee crime (Bornstein, Avram). Unfortunately, it is ingrained in today’s society that institutional structures demonstrate persistent inequality and unequal distribution of societal resources (White, Rob).\nIn this day in age Racial stereotypes appear to be as rampant as they were in the early 200s. The discussion and debate about race can be a sensitive and difficult subject for most individuals. Living in America is tough as it is with all of the crisis’s and chaos taking place left and right. That matter of race is a crisis of its own so to speak. One cannot express themselves completely to the extent of his or her liking without being judged, labeled or categorized.\nRace refers to the physical form of some common genetic characteristics of the crowd. This is born, cannot be chosen. While ethnicity refers to the people with the same experience, cultural background or language. The United States as a migrant country, immigration culture, complex skin color, ethnic racial relations are complex. The race of society has been going on for more than half a century. Racism is a self centered attitude, and racial differences determine the history of human society and cultural development. Racial discrimination has always been a serious social problem.

How was it that you became the caregiver, and how old were your siblings then?\nBORKOWSKI: Well, my mother died in 1970, when I was 16. She died of breast cancer. And then my father never really got over that trauma. And then the years - a couple years passed, and he died when I was 19. He committed suicide.\nLUDDEN: That must have been so hard.\nBORKOWSKI: It was. And I think it was challenging - I mean, my mother's death, although that was really hard, was expected after a while. She'd been sick for about three years. But for us, my father's death was very unexpected. And my siblings at that point, when I was 19 - the next one down from me was 14, and then - my brother was 14, my sister was 13, and my youngest brother was 10.\nLUDDEN: So you were having to deal with adolescents and teens while you were a teenager. How was it that you became the caregiver? There was no one else who - what happened?\nBORKOWSKI: Well, we have relatives who are sort of spread from coast to coast, aunts and uncles. And at one point they did come together, and there was talk of, you know, each of them sort of taking one of the kids, which, you know, from a selfish standpoint, would have been awful. I would have been - really, I would have lost everything at that point.\nAnd so fortunately, we all wanted to stay together, and we had a - the attorney who had been my father's business attorney was helping with all of this and knew that I had been doing - taking care of the family since my mother had taken sick, and so was really in our corner and said, no. We can make this work. And so we kept the kids all together and stayed together as a family unit.\nLUDDEN: And by consensus, everyone - the four of you were - wanted this to happen this way.\nBORKOWSKI: Yes, absolutely. I think there were maybe times later when they questioned that, you know.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBORKOWSKI: At that moment in time, yes, indeed.\nLUDDEN: But you didn't have official legal custody.\nBORKOWSKI: No. That was a little challenging, as it turned out. My - for example, my sister, when she was in middle school, soon after - and I want to say it was maybe that following fall. My father died in June, and so maybe in the fall, when she went to\nDoc 4(Title: \"When Older Siblings Step Into Parents' Shoes : NPR\") nds meet. I had to take on a parent role for my younger sister. I was constantly on her back to finish her homework and clean up. Basically I was trying to help my mom with the parenting, and now as we've grown up, it turns out my sister does not look at me as a friend, but rather she always complains that she has two moms.\nLet's bring another call in, Chris(ph) in Denver, hi Chris.\nCHRIS: Hi, this is a really interesting conversation. I kind of bring together my personal experience of being the oldest of a blended sibling set, two biological brothers and a step-brother and step-sister that are 10 and 11 years younger than I am. And our parents worked out of town a couple of days a week. So there were always at least two days a week that I was in charge as a 15- and 16- and 17-year-old.\nAnd then I worked in family court and with juvenile offenders, and in that realm, I also saw a lot of instances where an older sibling ended up being the caretaker for the younger siblings because the parents were incarcerated or, you know, had drug and alcohol issues. And I like what your guest has brought up about the concept of there are gains but also a price to pay.\nOne thing that I have seen as a through-line in, again, my personal experience and also some of my professional experiences, are challenges that come with adult relationships once that older sibling who kind of inherits responsibility early enters adulthood and also the idea that it's very hard to ask for help because you've inherited independence and a tremendous amount of responsibility so early in age, you take all of this on, and once you get into adulthood, it's very hard to ask for help, and you end up taking - continuing to take on things in adulthood without knowing how to enlist the help of others.\nLUDDEN: Ha.\nCHRIS: And I think a lot of that ties back to that, you know, that early inheritance of responsibility.\nLUDDEN: That's interesting because I would have thought, on one hand, you would have been forced to ask for help to take on so much. But I guess you just felt you got - you had it. You became independent and - hmm. Vicki Panaccione?\nPANACCIONE: Well, I think that this is what happens with kids who have to raise their sibs even in homes, and I have to say I see this even in the best of homes. There's two-parent families that are both working, and they just have long hours, and the older kids have to come home and fix the dinner or get the kids to start on their homework or their bath.\nSo this situation really runs the gamut, from the hardworking best of families all the way up to the worst case scenarios. And so I see a price. And I work with families a lot like this in my office, and I do see a price because I think you're right. Chris, you don't start asking for help because the actual unspoken message really is we need you to take care of this. So you do.\nLUDDEN: Now what about - Chris mentioned it's difficult to form adult relationships.\nPANACCIONE: I think that can be, first of all, that you could miss out on having the model of a mom or a dad or both of them in the home to see what adult relationships are all about. And also, again, they've lost that opportunity to develop into a functioning adult. You're just kind of thrown into it. And so I think that they're so self-sufficient and feel like they need to be in control and can't ask for help, that it may be hard to let someone else in.\nLUDDEN: Chris, thank you so much for your call.\nCHRIS: Thank you.\nLUDDEN: And let's get another caller on the line. Marilyn(ph) in Oakland, California. Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION, Marilyn.\nMARILYN: Hello. My story is - and this is quite true - when I was 11 years old, my mom had a nervous breakdown. I'm the oldest of six children, and I actually picked up the telephone to call for help for her. I called the operator, and I'm from New York City.

In the real world, though, it's not quite that romantic. Understanding the basics of the marriage license and marriage certificate process is key to guaranteeing that your nuptials are properly (and legally) signed and sealed, so you can live happily ever after—officially. We talked to marriage experts about these important documents. Diane Smith-Hoban, executive director of Journeys of the Heart Mirelle Eid, owner of Honeybreak Officiants The Ultimate Wedding Day Checklist: What You'll Need for Every Part of Your Event The Marriage License vs. the Marriage Certificate There's a simple way to explain the difference between the marriage license and the marriage certificate: A marriage license lets two individuals get married; a marriage certificate proves they did it. What Is a Marriage License? Getting your marriage license is a must-do task for your pre-wedding checklist. \"A marriage license is a legal document applied for by a couple and issued by the county/state that allows them to marry,\" says Diane Smith-Hoban, executive director of Journeys of the Heart. \"This must be obtained before the wedding.\" How to Get a Marriage License Each state has its own requirements for obtaining a marriage license; expiration dates, waiting periods, and fees all vary. \"Couples will apply for a marriage license and then pick it up from the town/city clerk's office anywhere from a few days to a month before their wedding,\" says Mirelle Eid, owner of Honeybreak Officiants. Requirements for a Marriage License Most states require applicants to show up in person at the local clerk's office and have a valid photo I.D. To get a marriage license in most states, the couple must be at least 18 years old or, if younger, have consent from a parent or judge. If either of you were married before, you'll need to show proof of your divorce or annulment. Both parties must be mentally capable of understanding what getting married means, and they can't be closer than third cousins. Blood tests aren't required in any state; some states do, however, require a witness to be present when a license is issued. Research other rules pertaining to the state where you're marrying. In New Mexico, for example, an engaged couple is issued a license immediately at the county clerk's office (if they pass certain requirements); there's no waiting period, and the fee is $25. In Alaska, the waiting period is three days from the time the license is issued; the license is valid for three months and costs $60. In New York, says Eid, the marriage must take place within 60 days of getting the license but not less than 24 hours after. \"This 24-hour maturation period is stamped on the license to the minute,\" she says. So if you pick up your license at 4:32 p.m. on the day before your wedding, it can't be legally signed at your 2 p.m. ceremony the next day. What to Do With a Marriage License Make sure you bring your marriage license to the ceremony, wh\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems children do not actually want to marry their older siblings.

A significantly important part of their identity is the language spoken at home, a valuable resource that connects them to family and can lead to a positive self-concept and educational success if promoted in school (Cummins, 2001; Genesee, 2012). The good news is that, regardless of the language program model in place, educators can create positive learning environments and make conscientious choices that build upon the cultural and linguistic resources students bring with them. The following are some suggestions:\n- Form traditions and rituals that incorporate the home language. It can be the start or end to the school day or a celebratory song/chant when the class accomplishes a goal. Come up with it together and make it your own! Many times, these are the things that students remember and enjoy.\n- Empower students and families by allowing them access to the “ways of school.” Depending on their exposure to our school system, students from nonmainstream cultures benefit from explicit guidance on how the classroom and the school functions. This can be especially challenging when there is a language barrier so, as much as possible, educators should make every effort to communicate information in the home language.\n- Tap into family and community resources. Invite family and other community members into the classroom to read a book, model how to do something, or teach a song or a poem in the home language. This can also be kept in mind when scheduling classroom trips.\n- Include the home language in ways to assess children’s understanding of concepts. As much as possible, utilize the home language to create ways for students to demonstrate what they know. At the very least, always have it as a point of consideration when analyzing other data points. This will be helpful for guiding instruction and making decisions about programming.\n- Advocate for the use of the home language beyond the classroom walls. Collaborate with and enlist the help of school staff, especially those who speak the students’ language(s), in infusing the home language throughout the day, during lunch, on the playground, in special classes, and at school-wide events.\n- Choose materials that authentically represent students’ language and culture. Offer a variety of books, both fiction and nonfiction, in the language(s) spoken by students. Choose books with which students can connect and encourage them and their families to be the creators of their own stories\nThe goal is that one day all students will have the opportunity to develop bilingual proficiency. Until that day comes, students will benefit from the choices educators make to honor and promote the home languages they bring to the classroom.\nReferences/Suggested Readings\nBaker, C. (2000).

The panel explored what possibilities emerge when we see our communities as the playground for learning, rather than confining learning to a single school building. Ultimately, what if what public education provided was your home base: the place that you got to be loved and nurtured to make sense of your learning, to set goals, to create learning pathways, and where you, in partnership with the community, navigated your learning pathways?\nBelow, you can watch the recording of the webinar or read the lightly edited transcript.\n[00:05:55] Kelly Young: I want to start laying the groundwork for our conversation, because each of you have had amazing experiences, where you have seen how community assets—the people, the places, the history, and the culture—has actually transformed kids’ relationship to themselves, to their learning, and to their community.\nCould each of you share any experiences where you have seen how igniting community assets has the ability to transform kids’ experience of learning?\n[00:06:41] Timothy Jones: I’ll give a quick example. It was in Washington, D.C., in 1998, and we were coming up on the 30th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassination and the resulting riots in different cities. I had a group of teenagers who were near the 14th street corridor (near downtown D.C.), which, at this time, there were still areas of their neighborhood that had been damaged since 1968, that had never been built up.\nWe spent the summer making a video project called 14th Street Freestyle: 68 2 98. In order to do it, we identified individuals in their mid-to-late forties who were teenagers in 1968, who actually served as teachers: giving firsthand accounts of the experience of being a teenager in 1968.\nWe also went to Howard University’s Moorland-Spingarn Library and began to do research. We began to take pictures of what it looked like, and so we started pulling in all of these different resources, tying in the music history of what was going on at that time, including the advent of Go-Go.\nThe kids spent the summer studying, writing, and researching more than the ten months previously in school. And, we did it in partnership with the Wooly Mammoth Theater. At the end of the summer, we had this video that a number of them took back to school and their teachers actually incorporated it into their history classes.\nThat’s one example, where the young people brought the community together, and were then able to take a tool back to their class, to enhance what was taking place inside of the classroom.\n[00:08:53] Kelly Young: How did it impact the young people to get to work on a project like that?\n[00:09:02] Timothy Jones: It impacted them in a number of ways. It really helped them understand the history of Washington, D.C. through a different lens. They each had an opportunity to sit down and interview someone who was an elder and could share about being a teenager in the city in 1968. It also impacted them because they spent a lot of time talking to their parents in new ways because a lot of them were second and third generation Washingtonians.\nSo, in addition to the research for the project, it was also: “I’m gonna go to Northeast and sit down and talk to my grandmother,” because now they just started connecting the dots. It’s very interesting, because three to four of them ended up going into some field around education. And, so it strengthened the bond between us and it helped them see themselves as a stakeholder in the community in a different way than they did before the project.\n[00:10:12] Kelly Young: Joe [Hobot], I want to turn to you next. When we first spoke, you shared a story about how schools you visited actually got their start by doing after school programming and engaging the community. And, I’m wondering if you could share one of the stories of why en\nDoc 3(Title: \"How to Leverage Community Assets for Powerful Learning ...\") l and the community, as a parent, they say they want to engage with their kids’ school. Then, when I ask them to engage through the roles that they play in their professional life, they are willing to engage in another school.\nHow we choose or select our own identity influences what we’re willing to engage with and how we engage. We really need to be cognizant of how we’re asking people to engage and through which lenses they are seeing the world, both in the current system and what the system could look like in the future.\nI think that’s particularly relevant with parents because they grew up in the same system. There’s no reason why they should suddenly be able to reimagine the system today. We have to do it as a collective effort and a collective narrative. I recognize that’s not a concrete idea, but I think we make assumptions that people are going to imagine something different from what they experienced.\nIt’s why I work with artists so much. They get us out of our boxes and open us up to permeate the disciplines and other ways of creative thinking that our experience in the education system can sometimes limit us from accessing.\nQ. What would you tell people who are doing the work of leveraging community assets from a learner-centered perspective?\nTimothy Jones: Don’t worry about the pace of the change at the onset. You never get to fully understand the impact when you first start out. As much as you can, document and allow recipients of services to tell their story. There’s so much going on that it can almost paralyze you and make you feel powerless. But, you’ll see more possibilities if you change that perspective to, “There’s so much going on, that, if I just try my best, I’m going to find a way to make an impact.”\nJosh Schachter: In our culture and society, we talk about innovation a lot. Everyone wants to be an innovator and, as someone that was an educator, that’s now running a tech-focused nonprofit, I’ve come to realize that most innovation involves failure, humility, and iteration.\nWe have to embrace it. If we’re not willing to be learners in this process, listen to what we’ve learned, and adapt, then we’re not going to be able to get out of the current situation. We’re not going to get it right the first or second time, but maybe that’s the point. Isn’t that the point of learning?\nIt’s the journey of learning that creates the desire to learn. I think we need to have the humility to remember that is going to be central to whatever we’re going to create, and resist the pressure of funders and others who want us to present the outcomes and the outputs before we even start the process. That type of thinking probably isn’t going to get us where we need to go because we may not know exactly where we’re headed.\nI think there are bright spots that we can learn from, and we need to highlight those bright spots and share the lessons learned across our networks.\nJoe Hobot: I’m drawing from my experience as an Indigenous man within an Indigenous community, who’s had its youth be forced under subjugated protocols of a dominant culture until we reached an existential crisis with our language, our customs, and the corrosive effect education is having.\nMy advice, and what I’ve learned, is to be bold. The best examples of educational practices that have been working; they just dreamed it up and did it. After about two decades of protracted investigation and research into public education reform, and the academic achievements of the various communities of color within this country, we’ve come to understand that we’re in this “emperor has no clothes” moment.\nIt’s time to shed that fear that you’re going to need to have official approval of the systems in place and just do it. Dream it up and do it. Take care of your youth, educate them, and particularly in a culturally contextualized way that lifts them up and hardens them as valued individuals. Once we’ve embraced that agency for our communities, you’ll be able to see the achiev\nDoc 4(Title: \"Honoring and Leveraging Students’ Home Languages in the Classroom\") Honoring and Leveraging Students’ Home Languages in the Classroom\nThis is the first blog in the mini-series “Honoring and Leveraging Students’ Home Languages in the Classroom.” In this blog, I introduce some core concepts underscoring the importance of cultivating multilingual classroom spaces.\nI Am My Language\n\"So, if you really want to hurt me, talk badly about my language. I am my language.\" -Gloria Anzaldúa, Borderlands/La frontera\nIn the summer of 2014, I had the opportunity to study Portuguese in the beautiful Brazilian seaside city of Salvador. As a fluent Spanish speaker, I was confident that I would be able to pick up the language quickly, as the two romance languages have many lexical (vocabulary) and grammatical similarities. In the months leading up to that summer, I also enlisted the assistance of a local Portuguese tutor and completed daily language lessons on Duolingo. I couldn’t wait to get to Brazil to practice what I had learned.\nUpon arriving in Salvador, I was introduced to my host family, a kind couple with adult children who had “adopted” many foreign students over the years. During our first meal together, I bumbled through Portuguese as I attempted to introduce myself:\n“Sou Laura. Eu sou uma professora…uma professora de professeres.”\n(I am…a teacher of teachers? That sounds a bit funny…did I translate ‘teacher educator’ correctly?).\n“Eu investigo como estudantes aprendem uma lenguajem.”\n(I study how students learn languages. Students is estudantes, right? Or is it alumnos? Alunos? And is ‘lenguajem’ the right word for language? Ugh, I’m pretty sure I’m mixing Spanish and Portuguese…).\nAs I finished my introduction, my host family politely smiled and nodded, although it was clear that much of what I was sharing was lost in translation. Then they briefly introduced themselves, slowly and simply, and we spent the rest of the meal eating in silence.\nAs I climbed into bed that night, I felt a wave of frustration. During the conversation with my host family, I had wanted to shout, “I’m intelligent, I swear! And I’m extremely social. No one has ever called me quiet or shy.” And yet, there I was, a 30-year-old Ph.D. student who could barely string together a few introductory sentences in Portuguese. I’m happy to report that, over the course of the next few months, my Portuguese did (somewhat) improve, but the frustration and embarrassment of this first interaction stuck with me.\nI share this brief example of my foray into learning Portuguese because it points to one of the challenges commonly experienced by students learning a new language—the inability to fully express oneself and the frustration that accompanies not being able to be fully “you” in a new language. In English, I am a competent speaker and writer who teaches university courses, writes research articles, and frequently delivers professional development workshops. Yet, speaking Portuguese, I felt as if my intelligence and personality had been stripped, unable to have a simple discussion about a topic I knew well or engage in casual conversation.\nBilingual and multilingual learners, too, enter our classrooms with rich funds of knowledge and multifaceted identities that are too often made invisible in English-only learning spaces. A large body of research has shown that bi/multilingual students benefit from the ability to draw upon all of their language resources in the classroom, not only because it supports positive identity construction—which is reason enough to cultivate multilingual classrooms—but also because it can support student learning and academic achievement. For example, classroom translanguaging (when bi/multilingual students leverage what they know across all the languages in their repertoire) has been shown to scaffold student understanding of word meanings and academic concepts, build sophisticated metalinguistic understandings, and foster connections between the social, cultural, and linguistic domains of students’ lives.\nAddition\nDoc 5(Title: \"Response: ELL Students' Home Language Is an Asset Not a ...\") ate, many of our students learning English as an additional language enter the classroom already viewed as “lacking” or as “blank slates” in need of remediation. Rather than stigmatize the language and literacy practices that our students bring from their homes and communities, we should work toward recognizing the value of these resources and their place within our learning communities and schools.\nFrom my own experiences, I open my classroom door to you, and provide a glimpse into the ways that I created space for my students’ home language in my own learning community, even under very restrictive English-only policies.\n- Support Parents’ in Sustaining Home Language: There are some misconceptions made by teachers and families about language policies in schools. Our job is not to discourage families from sustaining home language, but rather to support families in their commitment to teaching their child their home language. This is a gift!\n- Home Language/Literacy Dig: Invite students to enter their homes as ethnographers and record all the different ways language and literacy is used in their homes and communities. This can uncover practices and “funds of knowledge” that can be included in the curriculum throughout the school year.\n- Dialogue Journals: Provide each student with a personal journal that is a shared writing space between the two of you. Give daily prompts or free writing time. Allow students the freedom to practice writing in any language without fear of judgement.\n- Classroom Newsletter: Create a classroom newsletter with students and their families as reporters. Invite families to contribute stories, recipes, how-to-guides, etc. in the language of their choice. Print and distribute to all families.\n- Family Writing Workshops: Create an after-school multilingual space for students and their families to draw, write and share stories in a variety of genres.\nEven under restrictive policies and mandates, our classrooms must provide space for our students’ home languages. A student’s home language is a powerful tool for mediating learning. Through their home languages, the language of the heart, students first learned as children—how to love, to hope, to dream and to wonder. This in itself is a powerful resource to use in our classrooms to build learning communities where students and teachers can learn, thrive and live--together.\nResponse From Sandy Ruvalcaba Carrillo\nSandy Ruvalcaba Carrillo is a resource teacher for dual language learners and co-author of More Mirrors in the Classroom: Using Urban Children’s Literature to Increase Literacy (Rowman & Littlefield, 2016) [Editor’s Note: You can read an interview I did with Sandy and her co-authors here):\nAcross the nation, districts vary in the language service delivery models that are implemented and often use a combination of programs. Decisions on which model to use are left in the hands of the local education agency and determining factors are state laws, population, resources, and the preference of the community. Language programs fall under one of two overarching goals, English development or bilingualism and biliteracy (Faulkner-Bond, et al., 2012; Garcia & Baker, 2007). These goals will drive how the home language is viewed and used: whether it is the means to acquiring English or developed so that students can understand, speak, read, and write in more than one language.\nWith the cognitive, psychological, and social benefits of being bilingual, programs in which the home language is not developed may be at odds with what is best for students (Baker, 2000). When children enter the door of a school, they bring with them all of who they are - lived experiences and rich backgrounds. A significantly important part of their identity is the language spoken at home, a valuable resource that connects them to family and can lead to a positive self-concept and educational success if promoted in school (Cummins, 2001; Genesee, 2012).

Like most of the other grand challenges of social work, the key to stopping family violence is to be proactive rather than reactive.\n4. Advance Long and Productive Lives\nAccording to the Administration for Community Living, the number of Americans aged 65 and older will grow dramatically over the next few decades, reaching 94.7 million by 2060. As the population of older Americans continues to grow, rates of health-related issues and conditions will also increase. This puts more pressure on health and social services, which makes it critical for social workers to develop interventions for helping the elderly and promoting greater overall health in aging populations.\n5. Eradicate Social Isolation\nSocial isolation is far more dangerous than many would expect. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), social isolation has been linked to increased risk of premature death, heart disease and stroke. By educating the public about strategies to promote social interaction, social workers can help isolated individuals improve their overall mental, physical and spiritual health.\n6. End Homelessness\nAccording to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, there were approximately 580,466 homeless individuals in the U.S. in 2020. Over 70,000 of them were veterans and unaccompanied youths. Homelessness can negatively impact individual health in multiple ways, and the effects are often long-lasting. By developing new service innovations and technologies and creating new policies to ensure affordable housing, social workers can help reduce the number of individuals experiencing homelessness.\n7. Create Social Responses to a Changing Environment\nClimate change and urban development have had an adverse impact on population health. According to The Nature Conservancy, the impacts of climate change strain agricultural systems and contribute to an increase in severe weather events such as storms, floods and wildfires. Helping conserve and protect the Earth is perhaps the biggest of the grand challenges of social work. However, by developing transformative social initiatives that engage communities to take charge, society as a whole can improve.\n8. Harness Technology for Social Good\nAs in many other fields, technology has the power to transform social work, allowing professionals to target their efforts for maximum efficacy. By utilizing technology in creative ways — such as applications designed for case planning, setting up treatment plans and organizing assessments — social workers can provide proper assistance to individuals and communities in need.\n9. Eliminate Racism\nAlthough America has come a long way since its founding, it has yet to fully eliminate one of its greatest historical flaws — racism. It’s no secret that the United States has a lengthy history of racism and white supremacy that still plague society. Racial inequality rears its ugly head in a myriad of ways, such as through racist policies, racial bias and discriminatory practices such as redlining. Social work has made considerable progress in the fight for equality and civil rights. To truly eliminate racism, social work must help develop a model that identifies hard evidence and employs practice-based interventions.\n10. Promote Smart Decarceration\nAccording to the Prison Policy Initiative, there were more than 1.8 million incarcerated people in 2020. The churn of jailed individuals (the number of times people are booked into a facility in a year) is skyrocketing at an alarming rate. By developing evidence-based solutions, social workers can promote smart “decarceration” — the act of removing individuals from institutions — and find effective ways to decrease the number of individuals going to prison, while offering sufficient solutions for overall public safety.\n11. Reduce Extreme Economic Inequality\nExtreme economic inequality impacts the overall health and well-being of less fortunate families and\nDoc 3(Title: \"12 Grand Challenges for Social Work - University of Nevada Reno\") Society is transforming at a rapid pace and social workers must do the same to provide the best support to their clients. Social work professionals handle circumstances and cases that deal with violence, substance abuse, isolation, inequality and other issues. With experience, proper training and a positive mindset, social workers across the nation have developed strategies for addressing these concerns, but many challenges remain.\nThe American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare developed the Grand Challenges for Social Work, an initiative blending science with the values and principles of social work to create a just and cohesive society. The objective is to foster new, transformative ways of addressing the many key issues that impede social work and societal success. Edwina Uehara, former president of the Society for Social Work and Research, believes this scientific approach will lead the way to a better world in social work.\n“Science is the foundation for positive social change,” she said. “We must employ tested methods built on robust data to achieve lasting impact on a scale that makes a profound difference in people’s lives.”\nThese social work grand challenges might be thought of as a way of focusing the efforts of social work to create new, innovative approaches to the difficulties faced by society. By using scientific methods, Richard Barth, former president of the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare, said these grand challenges can become issues of the past.\n“With its deep scientific knowledge base, social work is highly qualified to analyze and intervene to help our society make substantial measurable progress in the next decade on conquering these grand challenges,” he said.\nThe 13 Grand Challenges for Social Work\nThe grand challenges facing social work professionals encompass a broad range of issues, from inequities in health care and income to family violence and social isolation.\nUnderstanding each of the grand challenges is crucial for social workers who seek to employ empirically informed interventions to address society’s most pressing issues.\n1. Ensure Healthy Development for All Youth\nAccording to a 2022 report from Mental Health America, approximately 15% of youth experienced a recent major depressive episode. Additionally, the organization reports that more than 2.5 million youth in the U.S. have severe depression. Unfortunately, more than 60% of these young people aren’t receiving mental health treatment. Substance misuse is also on the rise, with roughly 4% of youth experiencing a substance use disorder in the past year. With family-focused interventions, social workers can help guide families to prevention programs that can better aid child development and mental health.\n2. Close the Health Gap\nWhen families have limited access to health care and are also dealing with discrimination, poverty and living in dangerous environments, the odds of contracting an illness increase drastically. According to a recent report from the National Center for Health Statistics, 9.7% of Americans didn’t have health insurance in 2020. However, with evidence-based social strategies, social workers can help bridge the health care gap and provide effective solutions to families and others in need.\n3. Stop Family Violence\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, nearly 20 people are abused by their spouse or intimate partner every minute, equating to more than 10 million abuse victims every year. This violence doesn’t only threaten the well-being of its victims but also costs billions in spending for criminal justice. Social, family-focused interventions can help individuals identify abuse early on and prevent it from happening in the future. Like most of the other grand challenges of social work, the key to stopping family violence is to be proactive rather than reactive.\n4. Advance Long and Productive Lives\nAccording to the Administration for Community Living, the number of Americ\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Reasons Behind Service Delivery Protests in South ...\") s, an American sociologist, in a 1962 article titled ‘Towards a Theory of Revolution’ theorised about rising expectations and the likelihood of armed conflict. His theory became known as the Davies J-curve, a model that attempts to explain the position where the pace of an individual’s reality is not in keeping with his/her expectations about how much better off he/she should be. Normally the individual's situation is not so bad that it leads either to conflict or to frustration, but when there is a sudden downturn (e.g. in the economy) a major gap is created between expectations and reality, resulting in frustration and discontent. According to Davies’ theory of relative deprivation these frustrated expectations are a cause of social unrest and increases the potential for political unrest. It also helps to overcome the collective action problem, which may breed revolt. ‘Revolt’ is defined as an attempt to fundamentally change an organizational structure in a relatively short period.\nOther sociologists such as Ted Gurr agree that the primary cause for revolution is the widespread frustration with the socio-political situation in a particular country. In his book titled Why men rebel, published in 1970, he supports the ‘frustration-aggression’ theory that explains the violence often accompanying the expression of frustration. The more intense and prolonged the frustration, the greater the probability of aggression. He also argues that the intensity and scope of relative deprivation determines the potential for collective violence and concludes that frustration-aggression is the ‘primary source of the human capacity for violence’.\nAt this stage it would probably be accurate to describe the fairly limited scope of current service delivery protests in South Africa as symptoms only of socio-political instability. However, it would be fair to conclude that if this situation is allowed to continue over a prolonged period it has the potential to spread and develop into a fully-fledged revolt. Therefore, although it is important for the police to maintain order and to enforce the law, the solution to the problem does not lie in policing but much rather in speedy solutions to the socio-economic conditions that prevail in many communities. Urgent interventions in relation to the conditions that bedevil the efficient and effective functioning and service delivery of municipalities are crucial. Finally, politicians – especially those who are fairly certain that they will be appointed to government positions after elections - need to take much more responsibility for the promises they make and the expectations they create.\nDr Johan Burger, Senior Researcher, Crime, Justice and Politics Programme, ISS Tshwane (Pretoria)\nDoc 5(Title: \"Why is Racism a Problem? - Free Essay Example | PapersOwl.com\") How To Write An Essay On Racism\nIntroduction to the Complexities of Racism\nWriting an essay on racism involves delving into a complex and sensitive subject that has deep historical roots and contemporary implications. Begin your essay by defining racism as a system of discrimination based on race, affecting individuals and groups socially, economically, and politically. Highlight the importance of understanding racism not only as overt acts of discrimination but also as institutional and systemic practices. This introduction should lay the groundwork for your exploration, whether it’s focused on historical aspects of racism, its manifestations in modern society, or strategies for combating racial prejudice and inequality.\nHistorical Context and Evolution of Racism\nThe body of your essay should include a detailed examination of the historical context and evolution of racism. Discuss how racism has been perpetuated and institutionalized over time, highlighting key historical events and policies that have contributed to racial discrimination and segregation. Depending on your essay’s focus, you might explore the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, Jim Crow laws, or apartheid, among other topics. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding how past injustices continue to shape present racial dynamics and attitudes.\nAnalyzing Modern Manifestations of Racism\nTransition to discussing the modern manifestations of racism. Examine how racism operates in current societal structures, such as in the criminal justice system, education, employment, and healthcare. Discuss the concept of systemic racism and how it perpetuates inequality, as well as the impact of racial bias and stereotypes in media representation and everyday interactions. This section should also address the intersectionality of racism, acknowledging how race intersects with other identities like gender, class, and sexuality, contributing to unique experiences of discrimination.\nStrategies for Addressing and Combating Racism\nConclude your essay by exploring strategies for addressing and combating racism. Discuss the importance of education, awareness-raising, and open dialogue in challenging racist beliefs and stereotypes. Reflect on the role of policy changes, affirmative action, and reparations in addressing systemic racism. Emphasize the importance of individual and collective action in fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. Your conclusion should not only summarize the key points of your essay but also inspire a sense of hope and commitment to anti-racist efforts, underscoring the ongoing work needed to dismantle racism in all its forms.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, sociology can help us understand society and face its challenges by providing frameworks and theories to analyze social issues such as extreme economic inequality, racism, family violence, and homelessness.

Constantly increasing competition in the modern health care industry has changed the role of the governments. It rearranged health care advocacy coalitions and interests, and made existing government policy tools obsolete or less meaningful. The public remains anxious about efforts to reduce subscriber utilization of inpatient hospital care and specialist services as a means of controlling costs (Chapman 14). The growing use of restrictive managed care arrangements by insurers has generated new concerns about the quality of care provided to the elderly, the poor, and patients who require costly treatments (McDonough 180). Under these circumstances, enacting comprehensive health care reform at the government level is necessary for coping with the dramatic changes in the organization and financing of health care.\nInsurance and the Government\nWithin all societies, the governments should assume responsibility for assuring medical care for all citizens. On the one hand, some members of society may not have sufficient means to insure themselves. On the other hand, if they have sufficient resources, they may suffer a form of myopia that means they allocate not adequate resources to cover their health care needs. One solution here can be to blanket in these difficult cases by socializing insurance either through the tax system, as in Canada, or through a system of non-profit sickness funds based on compulsory membership, as in Germany (McDonough 342).\nInsurance services would be produced more efficiently if they were produced by the governments. It is indicated that the government provides some insurance benefits at a lower unit administrative cost than the private markets would be able to provide them. For example, Flood (2000, p.1154) makes that point in the consideration of the Polish social insurance system. It is true that the government can nationalize medical care, make it universal, impose the same benefit scales on every citizen and then administer the system more cheaply than the private markets would do. Government may develop sufficient range of insurance products that may appear to add value because they can be adapted to suit individual needs.\nAssurances from the government to the members of the medical profession and the leaders of the voluntary hospital sector can improve access to the health care system for two seriously disadvantaged groups, the elderly and the poor. All conditions of medical care delivery would remain under professional control and guidance.\nResponsibility for providing health care services to the uninsured and underinsured should rest evidently with state government. For example, in the case of the poor, Congress created Medicaid: the government became the principal payer. This initiative designed a system of universal coverage for their residents. Both Medicare and Medicaid have had success making easier for the states to cover incremental expenditures incurred in treating increasing numbers of the poor and the uninsured. Medicare has also made it easier for rural hospitals and physicians that are in difficulties to increase their revenues and earnings, thereby helping them continue to provide sufficient health care to the rural population.\nFunding the Government Health Care\nThe government actively promotes competition as a means of controlling costs and increasing access to health care. Medicaid managed care waivers, for instance, can be used to considerably expand access to health care for individuals without health insurance by plowing cost savings from capitation for program enrollees into state-subsidized insurance programs for the working poor (Bauman 219). Government can also impose a mandatory budget cap on health care expenditures. In both examples, government officials are not just passive observers of market competition. Instead, they are channel and direct market forces in pursuit of public goals (for example, controll\nDoc 4(Title: \"Government Healthcare Pros and Cons - ThoughtCo\") Humanities › Issues › U.S. Liberal Politics › Pros and Cons of Government Healthcare Print Buero Monaco / Getty Images Issues U.S. Liberal Politics Liberal Voices and Events The U.

Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 13, 2025 Close Key Takeaways Government healthcare can make medical services accessible to those who are uninsured or underinsured.Critics argue government healthcare reduces patients' choices and could overwhelm private insurance options.Many Americans supported having a choice between public and private healthcare options. Government healthcare refers to government funding of healthcare services via direct payments to doctors, hospitals, and other providers. In the U.S. healthcare system, medical professionals are not employed by the government. Instead, they provide medical and health services privately and are reimbursed by the government for these services, in much the same way that insurance companies reimburse them. An example of a successful U.S. government healthcare program is Medicare, established in 1965 to provide health insurance for people aged 65 and over or who meet other criteria such as disability. For many years, the U.S. was the only industrialized country in the world, democratic or non-democratic, without universal healthcare for all citizens provided by government-funded coverage. But in 2009, that changed. Here's everything that happened and why it matters still today. 50 Million Uninsured Americans in 2009 In mid-2009, Congress worked to reform U.S. healthcare insurance coverage, which at that time left more than 50 million men, women, and children uninsured and without access to adequate medical and health services. This deficit was due to the fact that healthcare coverage for all people, except for some low-income children and those covered by Medicare, was provided only by insurance companies and other private-sector corporations. This made it inaccessible for many Americans. Private company insurers proved ineffective at controlling costs and providing inclusive care, some actively working to exclude as many people from healthcare coverage as possible. Explained Ezra Klein for The Washington Post: \"The private insurance market is a mess. It's supposed to cover the sick and instead competes to insure the well. It employs platoons of adjusters whose sole job is to get out of paying for needed health care services that members thought were covered,\" (Klein 2009). In fact, multi-million bonuses were even awarded annually to top healthcare executives as an incentive to deny coverage to policyholders. As a result, in the United States pre-2009, more than eight in ten of individuals uninsured were from families living 400% below the Federal Poverty Level. Non-white populations were also disproportionately uninsured; Hispanics had an uninsured rate of 19% and Blacks had a rate of 11% though people of color only made up 43% of the population. Finally, 86% of uninsured individuals were adults not classified as elderly. In 2007, Slate reported, \"The current system is increasingly inaccessible to many poor and lower-middle-class people ... those lucky enough to have coverage are paying steadily more and/or receiving steadily fewer benefits,\" (Noah 2007). This widespread issue led to a reform campaign begun by the Democratic party and supported by the president. Reform Legislation In mid-200\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Government Should Provide Health Care | Blablawriting.com\") working poor (Bauman 219). Government can also impose a mandatory budget cap on health care expenditures. In both examples, government officials are not just passive observers of market competition. Instead, they are channel and direct market forces in pursuit of public goals (for example, controlling Medicaid costs).\nThe primary funding for the health care can be accomplished through a Government Health Care Fund. The funds for this heath care program is derived and provided to the Fund in the following manner (Bauman 251):\n- Employer contribution equal to 3 percent of the gross earnings of each wage or salaried employee.\n- Employee contribution of 7 percent of gross earnings, with no upper limit.\n- A 1 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on all consumer durables produced in the home country or imported from foreign nations.\n- For each dollar of foreign aid granted to any foreign government or nation 0.001 percent of such amounts will be provided to the Health Care Fund for national health care.\nUniversal Coverage\nIf any kind of universal coverage is adopted, the costs are large in size and require all citizens to both contribute to the government health care system and contribute to the reduction of the national debt. If health care is absolutely “de-linked” from the workplace and the government makes a social contract with individuals for their own health care, business and industry can go about doing what they should do-making a high quality product at the lowest possible price, while providing a reasonable rate of return to investors (Crichton and Robertson 142). In this case, a government health care plan will stand or fall on the willingness of individuals to pay their fair share of the costs for the received health care.\nThe Role of Government in Health Care\nThe following aspects of health care need to be put into focus:\n- Patients’ incentives should probably be reweighed by subjecting every lab test, visit to a medical office or clinic, or other item of medical service to a “deductible” (Chapman 36).\n- Governments need to bar “punitive” damage claims for malpractice. Careful estimations must be required for “substantive” damage claims (Crichton and Robertson 57).\n- Governments need to control litigiousness. For example, in the United States it is far worse than in other countries (Havighurst and Richman 10).\n- Governments urgently need legislative reform to control the authority of such interest groups as health insurers and health providers (Havighurst and Richman 10).\nConclusion\nThe unsuccessful attempts to enact national health care since early in the century were the result of constant constraints on reorganizing the financing and delivery of health care. Health care has historically been fixed in fee-for-service physician care and the prevalence of voluntary hospitals. Further, the health care system was extremely transformed in the post-war period by the rapid growth of private health insurance. However, except for tax subvention, the government played no direct role in public health care until the passage of Medicare and Medicaid.\nToday, the governments should take a lead role in the reform of the current health care system. The governments have residual responsibility for the provision of essential health care to all of their citizens. Government, not companies, should provide health care. The goal of transferring full responsibility to government might prove effective. A completely government-controlled health care system could provide basic health care services to the entire population. Government provision of adequate health care for the whole population produces commitment to social justice and a sense of solidarity and mutual dependence among the population.\nReferences\nBauman, Robert E.

The vice president is also president of the U.S. Senate, and can cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate.\nInitially, electors did not vote separately for president and vice president, but cast a single vote; the candidate who came in second became the vice president. But in 1804, after two highly contentious national elections, the 12th Amendment changed the voting process to the current system.\nDid you know?\nPresident Thomas Jefferson and Vice President George Clinton were the first executives to be voted into the White House after the passage of the 12 Amendment.\nThe federal government has 15 executive departments (including Defense, State, Justice, Labor, Education, Health and Human Services and so on). Each of these departments is led by a member of the presidential cabinet, who serve as advisors to the president.\nThe heads of numerous executive agencies (the Central Intelligence Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, etc.) are not formally members of the Cabinet, but they do fall under the president’s authority. The executive branch also includes more than 50 independent federal commissions, including the Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission and many others.\nAnother integral part of the executive branch is the Executive Office of the President (EOP), which was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Headed up by the White House chief of staff, the EOP includes the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Security Council and the White House Communications and Press Secretary.\nWho Is in Charge of the Executive Branch?\nArticle II of the Constitution specified that a president—who is in charge of the executive branch—should be elected to a term of four years. According to its terms, only natural-born citizens of the United States of at least 35 years of age, who have lived in the United States for at least 14 years, are eligible for the nation’s highest executive office.\nOnly one president in U.S. history—Franklin D. Roosevelt—has served more than two terms in office. In 1951, six years after FDR’s death during his fourth term, Congress ratified the 22nd Amendment, which limited presidents to two terms. This restriction serves as an additional check on the power of any one person over the nation’s government.\nThe vice president is also elected to a four-year term, but vice presidents can serve an unlimited number of terms, even under different presidents. The president nominates members of the Cabinet, who must then be approved by at least 51 votes in the Senate.\nDoc 2(Title: \"The Impact of Corruption on the Effectiveness of Public ...\") s ills[28].\nIn a liberal democratic setting, the Public Administration is designed as an executive tool to serve citizen’s expectations. These expectations are primarily expressed through the voting process based on Agendas. The elected representatives, now officially transformed into policy makers, are expected to demonstrate responsiveness for two major reasons; the first is, to keep their electoral promises and the second, to secure their reelection. They can do this through the executive action by vertically interacting with the Public Administration. The latter can only perform properly and reach a high level of efficiency and effectiveness if it is protected from the negative interference of political bias.\nMilton Friedman, from capitalism to freedom, University of Chicago press, 1962. “To the free man, the country is the collection of individuals who compose it, not something over and above them. He is proud of a common heritage and loyal to common traditions. But the regards government is as a mean, an instrumentality, neither a grantor of favors and gifts, nor a master or god to be blindly worshiped and served”.\nWoodrow Wilson, the shady of Administration, Political Science Quarterly, 1887. “Administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics. Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its office”.\nE. Responsiveness in Public Administration:\nResponsiveness refers to the practice of ensuring that clients are served helpfully and responsibly by government agencies and officials. Wilson argued that the most common strategy for dealing with the idea of responsiveness is to treat it as an aspect of responsibility. While Finer made responsibility a subdivision of responsiveness, rather than vice versa. Thus, the agency has to ensure that its services are accessible to clients[29]. Approaches are controversial in understanding responsiveness in public administration. Some scholars refer to responsiveness as a ‘necessary evil’ that seems to conciliate professional effectiveness and a signal to political convenience if not absolute corruption. However, other scholars suggest that democracy would appear to necessitate administrators who are responsive to the people’s will at least through politicians and legislatures if not straight to the population. Dissimilar to the private sector, the public one must take into consideration social equal opportunities, equity, welfare, and just supply of ‘public goods’ to all residents. To examine the performance of governmental activities, the acceptance of the people for the outcome of public administration activities must be tested according to some measures such as the contributiveness, fruitfulness, responsiveness to public needs and equality of the distribution of these activities[30].\nCorruption in the political system, the misappropriation of public funds, the bureaucratic rigidity, red tapism weaken the public administration and make it irresponsive to the people’s needs[31].\nF. Failure of the Democratic Process in Decision-Making:\nThe values of democracy and the rule of law are both fundamental to the modern administrative state. Democracy enhances the credibility and stability of government and also improves the quality of public policy[32]. Democracy creates the enabling environment for broad based economic growth through markets. The predictability and stability of policies are conducive to markets, and the protection of property rights and enforcement of contracts are best ensured under democratic regimes. Democracy facilitates openness in policy dialogue, free press and respect for human rights and the rule of law, which are crucial for economic growth.\nEthics is one of the vital components that allow democracy to thrive in any country. Ethics in government is critical to realizing the promises of democracy.

However there were many other takers for it and in USA, Frank J Goodnow, was an important advocate of this legal approach.\nIn his book Politics and Administration he challenges Montesquieu’s theory of separation of power in the book Esprit De Lois which proposed three branches of power; legislative, executive and judiciary but highlighted the independence of judiciary from administrative as the sole recognition of judicial power.\nAccording to Goodnow, this in itself was not sufficient and that extreme form of this theory was incapable of application to any concrete political organization.

We also partnered with different policy professionals in D.C. because we didn’t know how to present a policy recommendation to Congress.\nThat was on a whole new level—the role the community [can play]. We needed to have the humility to know we didn’t have to know everything and that the community can be there to support us.\n[00:21:20] Kelly Young: I remember my first day at DC Public Schools as a Chief for Family and Public Engagement. And, I wrote up on my board that the biggest crisis facing public education was fear, isolation, and disconnection.\nWhat all three of you are talking about is that deep connection to culture, history, belonging, community, and family, which is often not what people imagine when we say learner-centered. But, it’s exactly at the heart of all of this.\nGiven these rich experiences and that they were deeply embedded in the community, how can folks who aren’t in schools right now act on these lessons right now?\n[00:23:01] Timothy Jones: For educators right now, it’s imperative that they take the time to understand the community that they’re students are in, which can be challenging because, depending on where their school is situated, you may have students who are representing various communities.\nAs you think about schools starting now, the students have been out of school for five to six months. How has that community been surviving? Who are the gatekeepers? Where are the resources? And, as a teacher, you have to tap in to them. It cannot be this notion of students coming to you, whether in person or virtually, as them leaving the community that has really become their lifeline during this pandemic. You have to come in, as an educator, with that level of humility and that level of sincerity to really find a way to connect to the community.\n[00:24:46] Joe Hobot: First and foremost, there needs to be a wholehearted culture shift within public education circles. It’s typical role has been to assert that dominion of the dominant culture over communities of color. And, we see that translating into reform efforts.\nThey’re the ones, the providers, the administrators of public education, and always first into the breach to say, “We will lead these reform efforts.” Our number one response is, “No. You’re the ones who drove the bus into the ditch to begin with, and we don’t have any faith that you’re going to get us out of it.”\nAnd second, “you haven’t examined your motives for why public education is functioning the way it is.” In that sense, public education needs to really understand that it needs to take a step back and play a support role, and allow the communities themselves to lead. In this framework, we talk about community governed approaches to education.\nCommunities and communities of color—the BIPOC communities—have the answers. They have the solutions. They know exactly how they want their youth to be educated and lifted up to be critical thinking citizens.\nWhen I talked to the folks in my research and my work, the most disenfranchised people in this country are parents within communities of color that are being serviced by public education. Oftentimes, they don’t feel listened to. They don’t believe that their belief systems, practices, cultures, and traditions are reflected within public education. And oftentimes, they’re related to in a very patronizing way.\nThis practice must stop. In public education, the first step is acknowledging the problem and then stepping back and seeing that they’re not the ones who are going to solve it.\nOn top of that, I think we need to be very deliberate and intentional about reform efforts going forward. Specifically, we need to embrace community governance decisions and listen to these communities and the constituencies and their solutions, and then optimize and operationalize them. And, we need to decouple administrators from the practitioners.\nReal innovation is driven by teachers within the classroom. They have no choice.

One of the Renaissance's leading lights was poet and author Langston Hughes.\nHughes not only made his mark in this artistic movement by breaking boundaries with his poetry, he drew on international experiences, found kindred spirits amongst his fellow artists, took a stand for the possibilities of Black art and influenced how the Harlem Renaissance would be remembered.\nHughes stood up for Black artists\nGeorge Schuyler, the editor of a Black paper in Pittsburgh, wrote the article \"The Negro-Art Hokum\" for an edition of The Nation in June 1926.\nThe article discounted the existence of \"Negro art,\" arguing that African-American artists shared European influences with their white counterparts, and were, therefore, producing the same kind of work. Spirituals and jazz, with their clear links to Black performers, were dismissed as folk art.\nInvited to make a response, Hughes penned \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain.\" In it, he described Black artists rejecting their racial identity as \"the mountain standing in the way of any true Negro art in America.\" But he declared that instead of ignoring their identity, \"We younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual, dark-skinned selves without fear or shame.\"\nThis clarion call for the importance of pursuing art from a Black perspective was not only the philosophy behind much of Hughes' work, but it was also reflected throughout the Harlem Renaissance.\nSome critics called Hughes' poems \"low-rate\"\nHughes broke new ground in poetry when he began to write verse that incorporated how Black people talked and the jazz and blues music they played. He led the way in harnessing the blues form in poetry with \"The Weary Blues,\" which was written in 1923 and appeared in his 1926 collection The Weary Blues.\nHughes' next poetry collection — published in February 1927 under the controversial title Fine Clothes to the Jew — featured Black lives outside the educated upper and middle classes, including drunks and prostitutes.\nA preponderance of Black critics objected to what they felt were negative characterizations of African Americans — many Black characters created by whites already consisted of caricatures and stereotypes, and these critics wanted to see positive depictions instead. Some were so incensed that they attacked Hughes in print, with one calling him \"the poet low-rate of Harlem.\"\nBut Hughes believed in the worthiness of all Black people to appear in art, no matter their social status. He argued, \"My poems are indelicate. But so is life.\" And though many of his contemporaries might not have seen the merits, the collection came to be viewed as one of Hughes' best. (The poet did end up agreeing that the title — a reference to selling clothes to Jewish pawnbrokers in hard times — was a bad choice.)\nHughes' travels helped give him different perspectives\nHughes came to Harlem in 1921, but was soon traveling the world as a sailor and taking different jobs across the globe. In fact, he spent more time outside Harlem than in it during the Harlem Renaissance.\nHis journeys, along with the fact that he'd lived in several different places as a child and had visited his father in Mexico, allowed Hughes to bring varied perspectives and approaches to the work he created.\nIn 1923, when the ship he was working on visited the west coast of Africa, Hughes, who described himself as having \"copper-brown skin and straight black hair,\" had a member of the Kru tribe tell him he was a White man, not a Black one.\nHughes lived in Paris for part of 1924, where he eked out a living as a doorman and met Black jazz musicians. And in the fall of 1924, Hughes saw many white sailors get hired instead of him when he was desperate for a ship to take him home from Genoa, Italy.

And in the fall of 1924, Hughes saw many white sailors get hired instead of him when he was desperate for a ship to take him home from Genoa, Italy. This led to his plaintive, powerful poem \"I, Too,\" a meditation on the day that such unequal treatment would end.\nHughes and other young Black artists formed a support group\nBy 1925 Hughes was back in the United States, where he was greeted with acclaim. He was soon attending Lincoln University in Pennsylvania but returned to Harlem in the summer of 1926.\nThere, he and other young Harlem Renaissance artists like novelist Wallace Thurman, writer Zora Neale Hurston, artist Gwendolyn Bennett and painter Aaron Douglas formed a support group together.\nHughes was part of the group's decision to collaborate on Fire!!, a magazine intended for young Black artists like themselves. Instead of the limits on content they faced at more staid publications like the NAACP's Crisis magazine, they aimed to tackle a broader, uncensored range of topics, including sex and race.\nUnfortunately, the group only managed to put out a single issue of Fire!!. (And Hughes and Hurston had a falling out after a failed collaboration on a play called Mule Bone.) But by creating the magazine, Hughes and the others had still taken a stand for the kind of ideas they wanted to pursue going forward.\nHe continued to spread the word of the Harlem Renaissance long after it was over\nIn addition to what he wrote during the Harlem Renaissance, Hughes helped make the movement itself more well known. In 1931, he embarked on a tour to read his poetry across the South. His fee was ostensibly $50, but he would lower the amount, or forego it entirely, at places that couldn't afford it.\nHis tour and willingness to deliver free programs when necessary helped many get acquainted with the Harlem Renaissance.\nAnd in his autobiography The Big Sea (1940), Hughes provided a firsthand account of the Harlem Renaissance in a section titled \"Black Renaissance.\" His descriptions of the people, art and goings-on would influence how the movement was understood and remembered.\nHughes even played a part in shifting the name for the era from \"Negro Renaissance\" to \"Harlem Renaissance,\" as his book was one of the first to use the latter term.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Langston Hughes Impact on an Era - WriteWork\") most user-friendly writing tools.

In the past several years, solitary confinement has been the subject of criticism from civil libertarians and mental health advocates.\nUsually, solitary confinement involves isolating inmates in a small cell without human contact for 22 hours per day. Often called “administrative segregation”, solitary confinement has been the subject of increased scrutiny because of suicides and mental health issues suffered by prisoners who may be held for years in isolation. In A Sourcebook on Solitary Confinement, Dr. Sharon Shalev (2008), a leading international authority on solitary confinement, states that between one-third and 90% of prisoners experience some negative impacts of long-term solitary confinement. The symptoms may include insomnia, confusion, feelings of hopelessness and despair, distorted perceptions and hallucinations.\nFor over 20 years, the Correctional Investigator has criticized the overuse of solitary confinement in Canada. For example, see the Annual Report of the Office of the Correctional Investigator 2014-2015 (Annual Report, 2014-2015). The Correctional Investigator notes that solitary confinement is overused particularly for women with mental health issues, and for Indigenous and Black inmates.\nThe practice of administrative segregation is now called “Structured Intervention”.\nIn 1992, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, SC 1992, c 20 (CCRA), originally provided procedural safeguards for administrative segregation in sections 31 to 37. These may be summarized as:\n- Release from administrative segregation at the earliest appropriate time.\n- Reasonable alternatives to administrative segregation must first be explored and exhausted.\n- Inmates in administrative segregation have the same rights as those in the general inmate population, except those that cannot be exercised due to limitations specific to administrative segregation or security requirements.\n- The Correctional Service Canada shall take into consideration an offender’s state of health and health care needs in all administrative segregation decisions (Annual Report, 2014-2015).\nThere are also international guidelines called the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (also called the Nelson Mandela Rules). Rules 43 to 45:\n- prohibit indefinite or prolonged solitary confinement (over 15 days);\n- provide that solitary confinement is to be used only exceptionally; and\n- prohibit use for prisoners with mental or physical health disabilities that will be exacerbated by it.\nWhile not legally binding, Canadian courts will turn to these rules for guidance.\nIn British Columbia Civil Liberties Association v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 BCCA 228, the B.C. Court of Appeal considered whether solitary confinement violates a person’s s. 7 Charter right to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The Court confirmed that the 1992 CCRA provisions authorizing indefinite and prolonged solitary confinement, and internal rather than external review of decisions to segregate inmates in solitary confinement, violated these rights. The Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for one year.\nFor over 20 years, the Correctional Investigator has criticized the overuse of solitary confinement in Canada.In Canadian Civil Liberties Association v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 ONCA 243, the Ontario Court of Appeal provided, among others, that the CCRA provisions permitting administrative segregation for over 15 consecutive days violated a person’s s. 12 Charter right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. The Court found the violation could not be saved by s. 1 of the Charter (reasonable and justifiable violations).\nThe Supreme Court of Canada recently granted leave to the feder\nDoc 2(Title: \"Cultural - The Wiz - Sandwell College\") that we see followed today.” Jermaine added, “Over the last 10 years, it seems like every year there's another reproduction of a classic staple of the \"Great White Way\" with an all black cast, or a black performer is given a lead role traditionally played by a white person : from Taye Diggs as Hedwig in Hedwig and the Angry Inch to Norm Lewis as The Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, from the all black versions of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to Annie starring Quvenzhané Wallis and Jamie Foxx.

These expectations are primarily expressed through the voting process based on Agendas. The elected representatives, now officially transformed into policy makers, are expected to demonstrate responsiveness for two major reasons; the first is, to keep their electoral promises and the second, to secure their reelection. They can do this through the executive action by vertically interacting with the Public Administration. The latter can only perform properly and reach a high level of efficiency and effectiveness if it is protected from the negative interference of political bias.\nMilton Friedman, from capitalism to freedom, University of Chicago press, 1962. “To the free man, the country is the collection of individuals who compose it, not something over and above them. He is proud of a common heritage and loyal to common traditions. But the regards government is as a mean, an instrumentality, neither a grantor of favors and gifts, nor a master or god to be blindly worshiped and served”.\nWoodrow Wilson, the shady of Administration, Political Science Quarterly, 1887. “Administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics. Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its office”.\nE. Responsiveness in Public Administration:\nResponsiveness refers to the practice of ensuring that clients are served helpfully and responsibly by government agencies and officials. Wilson argued that the most common strategy for dealing with the idea of responsiveness is to treat it as an aspect of responsibility. While Finer made responsibility a subdivision of responsiveness, rather than vice versa. Thus, the agency has to ensure that its services are accessible to clients[29]. Approaches are controversial in understanding responsiveness in public administration. Some scholars refer to responsiveness as a ‘necessary evil’ that seems to conciliate professional effectiveness and a signal to political convenience if not absolute corruption. However, other scholars suggest that democracy would appear to necessitate administrators who are responsive to the people’s will at least through politicians and legislatures if not straight to the population. Dissimilar to the private sector, the public one must take into consideration social equal opportunities, equity, welfare, and just supply of ‘public goods’ to all residents. To examine the performance of governmental activities, the acceptance of the people for the outcome of public administration activities must be tested according to some measures such as the contributiveness, fruitfulness, responsiveness to public needs and equality of the distribution of these activities[30].\nCorruption in the political system, the misappropriation of public funds, the bureaucratic rigidity, red tapism weaken the public administration and make it irresponsive to the people’s needs[31].\nF. Failure of the Democratic Process in Decision-Making:\nThe values of democracy and the rule of law are both fundamental to the modern administrative state. Democracy enhances the credibility and stability of government and also improves the quality of public policy[32]. Democracy creates the enabling environment for broad based economic growth through markets. The predictability and stability of policies are conducive to markets, and the protection of property rights and enforcement of contracts are best ensured under democratic regimes. Democracy facilitates openness in policy dialogue, free press and respect for human rights and the rule of law, which are crucial for economic growth.\nEthics is one of the vital components that allow democracy to thrive in any country.

In the past several years, solitary confinement has been the subject of criticism from civil libertarians and mental health advocates.\nUsually, solitary confinement involves isolating inmates in a small cell without human contact for 22 hours per day. Often called “administrative segregation”, solitary confinement has been the subject of increased scrutiny because of suicides and mental health issues suffered by prisoners who may be held for years in isolation. In A Sourcebook on Solitary Confinement, Dr. Sharon Shalev (2008), a leading international authority on solitary confinement, states that between one-third and 90% of prisoners experience some negative impacts of long-term solitary confinement. The symptoms may include insomnia, confusion, feelings of hopelessness and despair, distorted perceptions and hallucinations.\nFor over 20 years, the Correctional Investigator has criticized the overuse of solitary confinement in Canada. For example, see the Annual Report of the Office of the Correctional Investigator 2014-2015 (Annual Report, 2014-2015). The Correctional Investigator notes that solitary confinement is overused particularly for women with mental health issues, and for Indigenous and Black inmates.\nThe practice of administrative segregation is now called “Structured Intervention”.\nIn 1992, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, SC 1992, c 20 (CCRA), originally provided procedural safeguards for administrative segregation in sections 31 to 37. These may be summarized as:\n- Release from administrative segregation at the earliest appropriate time.\n- Reasonable alternatives to administrative segregation must first be explored and exhausted.\n- Inmates in administrative segregation have the same rights as those in the general inmate population, except those that cannot be exercised due to limitations specific to administrative segregation or security requirements.\n- The Correctional Service Canada shall take into consideration an offender’s state of health and health care needs in all administrative segregation decisions (Annual Report, 2014-2015).\nThere are also international guidelines called the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (also called the Nelson Mandela Rules). Rules 43 to 45:\n- prohibit indefinite or prolonged solitary confinement (over 15 days);\n- provide that solitary confinement is to be used only exceptionally; and\n- prohibit use for prisoners with mental or physical health disabilities that will be exacerbated by it.\nWhile not legally binding, Canadian courts will turn to these rules for guidance.\nIn British Columbia Civil Liberties Association v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 BCCA 228, the B.C. Court of Appeal considered whether solitary confinement violates a person’s s. 7 Charter right to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The Court confirmed that the 1992 CCRA provisions authorizing indefinite and prolonged solitary confinement, and internal rather than external review of decisions to segregate inmates in solitary confinement, violated these rights. The Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for one year.\nFor over 20 years, the Correctional Investigator has criticized the overuse of solitary confinement in Canada.In Canadian Civil Liberties Association v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 ONCA 243, the Ontario Court of Appeal provided, among others, that the CCRA provisions permitting administrative segregation for over 15 consecutive days violated a person’s s. 12 Charter right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. The Court found the violation could not be saved by s. 1 of the Charter (reasonable and justifiable violations).\nThe Supreme Court of Canada recently granted leave to the feder\nDoc 2(Title: \"Cultural - The Wiz - Sandwell College\") that we see followed today.” Jermaine added, “Over the last 10 years, it seems like every year there's another reproduction of a classic staple of the \"Great White Way\" with an all black cast, or a black performer is given a lead role traditionally played by a white person : from Taye Diggs as Hedwig in Hedwig and the Angry Inch to Norm Lewis as The Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, from the all black versions of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to Annie starring Quvenzhané Wallis and Jamie Foxx. Many of these examples of non-traditional castings are walking through a door burst open by The Wiz.”\nDorothy's journey from a Kansas farm, down the yellow brick road to the great metropolis of the Emerald City, is at once a journey into maturation and an evocation of American myths about the frontier's development. “Wizard of Oz” mirrors the myth of American society's movement from conquering the wilderness to the building of big cities on the frontier. Dorothy's growth, and the growth of America, thus goes hand in hand. The Emerald City of “Wizard of Oz” represents the imagined dream-city of American culture: clean, happy, and glamorous. However, while on the surface the fantasy land of Oz is a desired respite, it's ultimately an illusory aberration. Oz represents the illusion of a childhood that cannot last, and the loss of the nation's frontier youth as well. The classic song from “Wizard of Oz,” “Over the Rainbow,” also describes every Americans' longing for something that's lost but might be regained.\nThe universal message of The Wizard of Oz is that the ideal place to solve problems is in the home. At the end of the film, Dorothy attests that she has found all she wants at home. “My heart's desire is in my own backyard,” she claims. The implication is that home is the last refuge of human hope. Faith in family values seems to surface especially in times of economic crisis, be it in the Depression years of which “Wizard of Oz” is a product, or in the Reagan and Bush years.\n“The Wiz set a trend that we see followed today.” Jermaine added, “Over the last 10 years, it seems like every year there's another reproduction of a classic staple of the \"Great White Way\" with an all black cast, or a black performer is given a lead role traditionally played by a white person : from Taye Diggs as Hedwig in Hedwig and the Angry Inch to Norm Lewis as The Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, from the all black versions of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to Annie starring Quvenzhané Wallis and Jamie Foxx.

This time in America’s pastime involved players using numerous performance enhancing drugs, resulting in an increased level of offensive performance. There is no “start” date to this era, but it is believed to have begun in the 1980s, and then it ran through the late 2000s. It should be noted that steroids were banned by baseball in 1991.\nDoping has created several historical outcomes in sports which are not always treated with the reverence that they would have if drugs or hormonal treatments were not involved. The MLB single-season home run record is an example of this. Since Babe Ruth’s record season of 60 home runs, there have been four players who have held that record since: Roger Maris, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Barry Bonds. All four of these players have their bats in the Baseball Hall of Fame, but they are not there.\nBaseball is not the only sport which deals with doping. Every athletic opportunity at almost any age bracket looks at the use of performance enhancers as a way to get the “edge” needed for success. In a survey of student athletes in eastern France, 1.2% of students as young as 11 admitted to using steroids, salbutamol, and even marijuana.\nThese are the doping in sports pros and cons that we should be worrying about right now.\nList of the Pros of Doping in Sports\n1. It gives athletes the freedom to take risks that they feel are appropriate.\nPerformance enhancing drugs give the human body a short dose of medicine that allows people to work out harder, faster, and longer while reducing their risks of suffering an injury. Whether it is applied through a cream, an injection, or pills, athletes can use these items for short periods, and then stop the cycle to allow their bodies to recover. Although this action does come with a risk to their health, that choice should be theirs to make instead of dictated by someone else.\n2. Competition is not impacted by the use of performance enhancing substances.\nThe nature of humanity creates unfair competition at times without the use of drugs or hormones. If we wanted to create an environment that was truly fair, then we would need to ban training and coaching altogether. People who train harder will always go further than those who choose not to train at all. Although competition is unfair if there is unequal access to enhancements, leveling the playing field through deregulation instead of prohibition would create results that were more authentic.\n3. Doping doesn’t shift the skill that is required to perform.\nHitters like Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire are often criticized because of their ability to hit a baseball further because of the real or perceived notion that they took drugs to do so. Even if they took performance enhancing drugs every day, that doesn’t change the fact that these men must hit the baseball in the first place to get a home run. Doping might help people perform better on some level, but it doesn’t shift the foundation of their skill at all. You must be able to compete naturally in the first place for this issue to be problematic. If Sosa and McGwire struck out all the time, no one would care about the performance enhancers because they wouldn’t have been in MLB in the first place.\n4. It is another tool that athletes can use to reach their personal goals.\nAlthough some athletes might feel pressured into the use of performance enhancing drugs, the results at the end of the day always come back to a choice. No one forces someone to become a competitive athlete, just like no one holds down someone to administer a PED injection unwillingly. People who commit themselves to winning games, performing to high standards, and competing at higher levels feel compelled to make themselves stronger and better. Is it unethical for one athlete to train for 4 hours per day while another only practices for 60 minutes?\n5.

The United Nations does not have its own definition of “urban” but instead follows the definitions used in each country, which may vary considerably. The United States, for instance, uses “urban place” to mean any locality where more than 2,500 people live. In Peru the term is applied to population centres with 100 or more dwellings.\nHistory\nWhatever the numerical definition, it is clear that the course of human history has been marked by a process of accelerated urbanization. It was not until the Neolithic Period, beginning at roughly 10,000 bce, that humans were able to form small permanent settlements. Cities of more than 100,000 did not exist until the time of Classical antiquity, and even those did not become common until the sustained population explosion of the last three centuries. In 1800 less than 3 percent of the world’s population was living in cities of 20,000 or more; this had increased to about one-quarter of the population by the mid-1960s. By the early 21st century more than half of the world’s population resided in urban centres.\nThe little towns of ancient civilizations, both in the Old World and the New, were only possible because of improvements in agriculture and transportation. As farming became more productive, it produced a surplus of food. The development of means of transportation, dating from the invention of the wheel about 3500 bce, made it possible for the surplus from the countryside to feed urban populations, a system that continues to the present day.\nDespite the small size of these villages, the people in early towns lived quite close together. Distances could be no greater than an easy walk, and nobody could live out of the range of the water supply. In addition, because cities were constantly subject to attack, they were quite often walled, and it was difficult to extend barricades over a large area. Archaeological excavations have suggested that the population density in the cities of 2000 bce may have been as much as 128,000 per square mile (49,400 per square km). By contrast, the present cities of Kolkata and Shanghai, with densities of more than 70,000 per square mile, are regarded as extremes of overcrowding.\nWith few exceptions, the elite—aristocrats, government officials, clergy, and the wealthy—lived in the centre of ancient cities, which was usually located near the most important temple. Farther out were the poor, who were sometimes displaced beyond the city walls altogether.\nThe greatest city of antiquity was Rome, which at its height in the 3rd century ce covered almost 4 square miles (10 square km) and had at least 800,000 inhabitants. To provide for this enormous population, the empire constructed a system of aqueducts that channeled drinking water from hills as far away as 44 miles (70 km). Inside the city itself, the water was pumped to individual homes through a remarkable network of conduits and lead pipes, the equal of which was not seen until the 20th century. As in most early cities, Roman housing was initially built from dried clay molded about wooden frameworks. As the city grew, it began to include structures made from mud, brick, concrete, and, eventually, finely carved marble.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Why is climate change happening and what are the causes ...\") , emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and cause land subsidence.

Second, while land use change is an important driver of climate change, a changing climate can lead to changes in land\nDoc 3(Title: \"What Causes Change in an Organization? 10 Factors Explored\") nd is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are environment-friendly in order to gain the loyalty and respect of their customers.\n3) Changed technology\nTechnology is one of the most important factors which force change in the organization, and organizations are required to adapt to these changing technologies in order to keep up with the competition.\nFor example, in the past times, all works like record keeping, order placement, etc. were being done manually, but in the present time with the help of computers, there is no need to perform these works manually.\nSimilarly, in the production process, there were many tasks which workers were supposed to perform with hands, but at present, with automation, all of these works are performed using machines, and this has not only reduced the man-error but also sped up the production process.\nNow customers have a platform to reach to the organization, and companies can respond to the queries made by customers quickly because of the presence of advanced technology.\nTherefore, companies are required to stay focused and make changes in technology whenever they require to stay relevant in the market.\n4) Social changes\nSocial change is also a crucial factor which causes a change in an organization. Companies are required to change their production process with the changes in the needs and aspirations of people.\nDemands of people vary on the basis of the social environment and the status of people — factors like level of education, international influence, urbanization cause social changes.\nFor example, the demands of people living in an urban area will be different from the demands of people living in rural areas. People living in an urban area don’t much care about the price of the product, but they care about the quality and services provided by the organization.\nWhereas, on the other hand, people living in rural areas are more concerned about the price of the product and care less about the quality of the product and they usually choose products cheapest among all available alternatives.\n5) Failure\nFailure is a factor which puts an end on the operations of some organization as these organizations take with shame and stops from taking risks with innovation ideas.\nHowever, there are some organizations which rather than sitting back and thinking about bankruptcy has taken failure as a challenge and worked hard to change the failure into success by analyzing their weak operations and the operations which were not working well for them and changed them in order to proceed towards success.\nA common example that everyone is aware of is the success story of Apple company. Steve Jobs, the founder of the company, was driven out of the company because of his aggressive behavior, and the company started losing its business after Steve left the company.\nSteve was hired back by the company in 1997, and now we all know how his alliance with the Apple company has proved beneficial for it.\nAt present Apple is one of the largest companies in the world. Steve was not intimidated by the failure, but he has trust in his skills and vision. He took the company in his hands when it is at its lowest and take it to the peak of success.\nSimilarly, there are several examples of companies which took failure as a lesson and worked hard to become successful companies again. However, sailing through tough times is not a cup of tea of every organization, emerging from failure requires strength, vision, and a tremendous amount of hard work.\n6) Competitive innovation\nCompetitive innovation forces companies to change. When a competitive company innovate something or do something which can be dangerous for your product then to meet the competition you need to make changes in you\nDoc 4(Title: \"Factors that Cause Change in Organizations: Planned and ...\") any performance. These types include:\n- Poor Financial Performance\n- Internal Crisis (such as a strike)\n- Changes in Employee Expectations\nMost companies, at one time or another, are faced with poor financial performance. This, in turn, causes significant changes that need to be made in order to help the company. Changes can consist of selling products, moving locations, hiring new management or even laying off employees. Cheapo Toys relies on producing the hot toy for the holiday season. If their toys are not popular with the kids, then drastic changes usually have to occur to save finances. Last year, for example, Cheapo Toys moved their headquarters from New York to Ashville, North Carolina, to save money. Many of the employees did not make the move and had to find work elsewhere.\nSometimes internal crises occur within the company that are unforeseen. For example, Cheapo's factory workers went on strike a few months ago to protest an expired contract and to request higher wages. This crisis caused a huge drop in toy production, which resulted in Cheapo having to sell their stuffed toy division for additional money to stay afloat during the strike.\nChanges in employee expectations is the third internal force of change. Employees today want flexible work time, the ability to work from home and excellent working conditions. This change in expectations has led many companies to offer an all-in-one corporate office to keep employees happy on site. Companies have free gyms, doctor's offices and even daycare available on site.\nPlanned and unplanned are the two types of changes that can occur with an organization. Planned changes occur when deliberate decisions are made in an organization, while unplanned change is a result of unforeseen occurrences. External factors and internal factors can cause both of these types of changes within a company. External forces of change are globalization, workforce diversity, ethical behavior and technology. Internal forces of change consist of poor financial performance, internal crises or a change in worker expectations.\nChanges in Organizations: Thought Exercises\nResearch Projects\n1.

In four words: we-are-doing-it. Let’s analyze the causes and discover 5 simple actions to take to save animals from extinction.\nRecent studies are launching the alarm: we are on the verge of the sixth mass extinction.\nToday, extinction rates are increasing, and this is only humans’ fault. According to a study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a total of 515 animal species are fading away. Likewise, Associations such as WWF are making the same appeal. We must do something, otherwise – by 2050 – polar bears, penguins and many more other animal species, will be only a far distant memory.\nDo you remember the Giant Panda, the Tamarow, and the Iberian Lynx? Forget about them: they are included in the list of animals on the brink of extinction. You won’t even be able to recall how they look like, in a few years time. Extinction will wipe them out, as if they had never existed.\nBut, while stressing the importance of acting now, the associations launching the appeal are also drawing attention to one important fact connected to animal extinction. While the other 5 mass extinctions were the consequence of all-natural geological causes, the current mass extinction is completely caused by men…by us.\nThe current extinction crisis (yes, it is a crisis… not a change!) is the consequence of many human-induced factors – which often combine. Some of them include habitat degradation (through poisoning, logging, urbanization), over-exploitation (overfishing and unsustainable agriculture), climate change and pollution, illegal hunting and illegal wildlife trafficking… and unfortunately, the list could go on.\n“The sixth mass extinction we are going through could be the most serious environmental threat to the survival of our civilization since it is irreversible” – experts say. By killing them, we are actually killing ourselves.\n5 Steps to Prevent Animal Extinction\nHowever, have you ever thought that we are the problem, and also the potential solution? We have the power to stop animal extinction, and we must act now. Everyone can make a change, small may it be, to protect not only the animals, but the whole environment (including ourselves).\nYou won’t have a second chance, extinction is forever: starting from today you must take action. So why don’t you begin by following this 5-steps guide to prevent animal extinction? It is easy, convenient, and you won’t regret.\nBear this in mind: small actions can lead to great changes.\n1. Buy Eco-Friendly Products\nWork for more environmentally-friendly (or at least more environmentally conscious) habits. First of all, beware and be aware of what you buy, and what you use. Always avoid buying potentially damaging products for the environment: avoid large corporations’ products that involve resources and processes which have a harmful impact on the animals – and especially on the endangered ones.\nThis also applies to cosmetics: avoid products made by companies that test their products on animals. Remember: we must stop animal testing, they don’t know the answer!\nWhen buying, you must read the labels on the packaging, in order to make sure the production process of that item did not involve any animal testing, nor environmentally dangerous practices.\nAlso, always make sure the producer company of each product you buy, work in an environmentally sustainable way – being it food, clothes, or its packaging in general. This will help in saving animals’ habitats, especially those of endangered species. In doing so, you will prevent animal extinction.\n2. Follow The 3-R Rule: Recycle, Reuse, Reduce\nSeparate and treat the discarded solid waste of the manufacture of new products. Come on, get creative! Recycle paper and cardboard, plastic, metals, glass and all the rest: you will be able to create new, fantastic objects.\nPlastic waste is a potential threat for the environment, and this includes its accumulation on the Earth surface. Beside being a powerful pollutant for the e\nDoc 2(Title: \"A 5 steps guide to prevent animal extinction - Ecobnb\") eener! We are literally “eating our way to extinction”. The meat industry is not only damaging farmed animals, but also wild ones – and especially the ones in danger of extinction. Studies warn that meat-eaters are actually speeding worldwide animals extinction.\nBy killing them, we are killing ourselves\nOur appetite for beef, for dairy, for fish is wiping out animals, and even threatening our own survival.\n“You eat a steak, you kill a lemur in Madagascar. You eat a chicken, you kill an Amazonian parrot”, says geophysicist expert Gidon Eshel, in order to make people realise the full impact of meat consumption on biodiversity.\nBeef, dairy, and fishing industries are today the leading cause of extinction. This also connects to the loss of habitat due to land clearing, but also overfishing and pollution.\nFirst, the vast majority of land clearing is to graze cattle for the meat industry, and to raise crops to feed farmed animals. Can you imagine that currently almost one-third of our planet’s surface is used for these purposes alone, and that this trend is even increasing? This is crazy. Almost 80% of former Amazon forests are now used for grazing cattle for meat.\nBy doing this, we are not only destroying the natural habitat of countless animals, but we are also destroying the ‘lungs of the Earth’, and as a consequence our own life.\nFor what concerns fishing, the greatest extinction danger is over-exploitation: in other words, we are fishing them to extinction in order to satisfy our needs.\nIn addition, many experts have explored the links between modern livestock production and other issues such as climate change and pollution; which eventually lead to animal extinction. For example, animal agriculture is responsible for almost 15% of climate emissions on a world scale, more than all the cars, trains, and planes.\nMeat-eaters are supporting the unsustainable production practices of the meat industry, and as a consequences they are speeding worldwide species extinction rate. We must change the way we eat and produce ‘food’: the current situation is having a catastrophic impact on almost all animal species across the globe.\nEvery meal counts\nBy eating less meat – whether one day a week or one meal a day – you will lower your dietary carbon footprint and take a step to protect wildlife.\nIf you change your eating habits, you will change the agricultural food market. This will result in more sustainable industries – because the meat demand-supply relation will be changed forever. It is simple: if you don’t demand, they won’t produce.\nA plant-based diet (or at least a diet which involves reducing the amount of meat and fish you eat) is one of the easiest, yet stronger ways, to use our planet’s resources more responsibly, and protect animals at the same time. In addition, plant-based food uses less water, have a lower impact on the environment, and guess what…it’s delicious.\nSo why don’t you save a Lemur and a Parrot today?!\n5. Spread Awareness: get involved\nTell the world! Let’s Stop the sixth mass extinction.\nTalk to your family and friends. If you can’t convince them to change their habits, at least try to warn them, and make them more aware of their actions. Start by spreading the advantages of buying eco-friendly products, of eating less meat, and of buying souvenir-greeting-cards when on holiday!\nLast but not least, be a voice for endangered species on social media: share posts, reels, tag your followers. Social media are also a great way of getting informed, and eventually, take more direct action. Stand for animals! together we can stop animal extinction.\nIn a nutshell: the next endangered species is literally us\nMass extinction seems a long way away, but actually, it is just around the corner. And even if you don’t care about endangered species, and you don’t love animals (which is basically impossible) this is not an excuse to sit back and watch. You still must act. In fact, if endangered species actually become extinct, many se\nDoc 3(Title: \"A 5 steps guide to prevent animal extinction - Ecobnb\") ome on, get creative! Recycle paper and cardboard, plastic, metals, glass and all the rest: you will be able to create new, fantastic objects.\nPlastic waste is a potential threat for the environment, and this includes its accumulation on the Earth surface. Beside being a powerful pollutant for the environment as a whole, it can negatively affect wildlife habitat – whether in the ocean or amongst nature.\nThe Recycling rule, applies especially for the products you buy. Make sure the packaging of your purchases (as well as its content) is made from recycled materials. Look for the special logo, and carry on with your purchase only if you see it! Also, have you ever tried second-hand products? If not, you should make it up: give it a try. It could be key in slowing down animal extinction.\nThe 3-R rule also applies to a more sustainable life in general: every small energy-saving change can have a huge impact on the health of threatened animals.\nFor example, by reducing the carbon footprint you may be able to help the environment, and improve your health at the same time.\nSmall actions, big changes\nstart by reducing the quantity of energy and fossil fuel you and your family use during the day. There are several ways of doing so:\n- Replace light bulbs, switching to energy saving ones – such as fluorescent bulbs (if you can’t find them in supermarkets, which seems really odd today, online shopping can help). In fact, fluorescent lightbulbs can work by using less fossil fuel than conventional lightbulbs.\n- Use a laptop instead of using a desktop computer when possible: laptops consume up to 5 times less!\n- On your bike!? Bike to work instead of driving. And guess what, you won’t only reduce air pollution, but this will also have a positive impact on your wallet, and on your health.\n- When leaving home, or at nighttime, make sure you turn off the heat and unplug the electronic facilities you have. Switching them off is not enough: you must unplug your laptop cords, your television, your phone charger, and even the kettle and the toaster in your kitchen. Did you know that even if you are not actually using these electronic gadgets, they still sap energy, just by being plugged in?\nBy following these tips you will be able to save not only energy and money, but you will also save the life of many endangered species.\n3. Don’t Buy Souvenirs Made From Endangered Species\nIf you do so, you are not only risking a fine, you are also increasing extinction rates. Stay away from products made from endangered (but also still-not-so-endangered) species!\nI see, you would really love to buy some iconic souvenirs on holiday, maybe to remind your family and friends the gorgeous places you visited – like a tropical beach or a South African Resort. But even if it doesn’t seem so, by making that purchase, you are actually increasing extinction rates (besides supporting illegal trading in poaching of wildlife!).\nThese products are filled with cruelty and pain, for the animals who suffered in the production process.\nThe illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth billions and billions of dollars each year. And if on the one hand it is mostly controlled by criminal gangs, it is also very much supported by the hundreds of millions of people going on foreign holidays and buying this type of souvenirs.\nThese items include materials such as tortoiseshell, ivory, reptile skins, furs, coral. Also, try to step into the animals’ shoes: have you ever thought that no one else needs a fur but a tiger? And, that no one else needs a rhino horn but a rhino? Or, that no one else needs a tortoiseshell but a tortoise?\nThink this through, you know the answer.\n4. Eat Less Meat\nBe greener! We are literally “eating our way to extinction”. The meat industry is not only damaging farmed animals, but also wild ones – and especially the ones in danger of extinction. Studies warn that meat-eaters are actually speeding worldwide animals extinction.\nBy killing them, we are killing ourse\nDoc 4(Title: \"A 5 steps guide to prevent animal extinction - Ecobnb\") long way away, but actually, it is just around the corner. And even if you don’t care about endangered species, and you don’t love animals (which is basically impossible) this is not an excuse to sit back and watch. You still must act. In fact, if endangered species actually become extinct, many serious consequences will follow.\nIn short, biodiversity is not just important because animals are nice to look at (although, if you are an animal lover, this is a bonus point to convince you!)…But beyond their beauty, each of these animal species is part of a whole system.\nIf you remove one part of the system, the system is no longer in balance, and will eventually collapse. In the long run this will lead to the extinction of every single species, including the human one.\nWe must stop this terrifying ripple effect because our own survival is at risk. Nature, and the ecosystems of plants and animals that live within it, is literally what is keeping us alive.\nAnd this is why you should care about animal extinction.\nSo what are you doing today to extinguish extinction? Save them, save yourself.\nFeatured image: Photo by Hans-Jurgen Mager on Unsplash\nDoc 5(Title: \"How Can We Help Save Animals From Extinction? - Blue and ...\") Environment\nHow Can We Help Save Animals From Extinction?\nWe teamed up with Simon Jeffery – Animal Manager at Port Lympne Reserve, Kent – to explore some pressing questions surrounding animal conservation. Here are our findings…\nWhich species are declining fastest?\nBig species like rhino are being poached in mass because of their horns – 1500 black rhinos were killed last year alone. Back in the 70’s and 80’s rhino’s horns were traded up the Yemen in East Africa, where they could then be made into ornamental handles for daggers. The West African black rhino is now recognised as extinct, as officially declared in 2011; the rhino was listed as critically endangered in 2008 and since, their numbers have fallen dramatically due a number of threatening factors. Although poaching is the most pressing cause of rhino decline, habitat loss also plays a large part in their rapidly decreasing numbers\nLions are one of the most recent species to have gained Endangered Species Act Protection. The new protection rules will address trophy hunts, like the one that killed the famous Cecil the lion earlier this year, to prevent the rapidly declining numbers of the African Lion.\nPhoto courtesy of the Aspinall Foundation\nGorillas are poached for trophy hunting and the bush meat trade. Such killing has reduced wildlife populations in general by up to 80% in some national parks. Deforestation also plays a huge part in the gorilla species’ decline. Smaller species are also affected by deforestation, such as monkeys, who have nowhere else to go and are hunted for bushmeat, especially in mining areas.\nPhoto courtesy of the Aspinall Foundation\nTo help these animals, people can donate to species preservation charities. At the Aspinall Foundation, we help protect forest and land across Africa and the world. It’s also massively helpful to buy ethically (fair trade products, for example) and make sure sustainable palm oil is used in your daily shopping; numerous websites will highlight sustainable palm oil products. Also, you should always recycle where possible!\nWhat can we do to help prevent the extinction of various species and deforestation of our planet?\nNot only does preventing deforestation give us a chance to preserve animals and wildlife communities, but it’s also the quickest way to stop global warming and the resulting climate change.\nTo stop climate change, renewable energy needs to be implemented in as many ways and places as possible. We need to recycle and shop ethically – this includes purchasing products which contain sustainable palm oil. Palm oil is one of the biggest causes of deforestation. If we continue to buy products that are recycled or support brands with zero deforestation policies, then cumulatively, we can show big companies and corporations that they, too, need to be a part of the effort to stop deforestation. If you’re buying wood products, look for Forest Stewardship Council Certification (FSC) on wood and wood products.\nPhoto credit: Michael Porter\nPhoto credit: Michael Porter\nWhat would you like to see more of in the hope to prevent the extinction of some of the planet’s most beautiful animals?

Global labor-market forces have pushed up the demand for highly skilled workers and have led to steadily increasing wages for those with a college education. The same forces have led to declining or stagnant wages for those with lower levels of education. And a decline in unionization rates and the fall in the real value of the minimum wage have exacerbated the downward pressures on middle- and low-wage workers.\nLess well understood are the causes of the tremendous surge in income among extremely high earners, meaning the upper 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 percent. From a policymaking point of view, the most important question is how much of the ultrarich’s income reflects activity, such as technological innovation, that benefits the broader economy. The more of it that does, the greater the potential economic costs of raising taxes on the highest-income individuals. If, in contrast, the income of the biggest earners is produced by pursuits that are less broadly beneficial, such as high-frequency stock market trading, then higher taxes at the top would pose fewer economic costs. Either way, there are likely compelling reasons to raise the top income tax rates—as a way of funding public services and investing in infrastructure, for example. But policymakers would be able to make better decisions about “soaking the rich” if they had a clearer sense of the tradeoffs involved.\nOne of the most interesting facts uncovered by Piketty and others is that compared with the richest people and families in the early 1900s, when large fortunes often came from inherited assets, today’s superrich are acquiring a larger share of their income in the form of earnings. About 60 percent of the income of the top one percent in the United States today is labor income. A number of essays in After Piketty mention the rise of “supersalaries” or “supermanagers”: top executives of large corporations, primarily in the financial industry, who enjoy very generous compensation packages. Economists disagree, however, about whether the income earned by such executives reflects the efficient working of a market for talent, in which case their pay reflects their value, or whether the massive compensation packages result from a bargaining process that is shaped by regulations, institutions, and social norms.\nIn their contribution to the book, the economists Laura Tyson and Michael Spence highlight the role of technological developments in creating substantial economic rewards for those who possess specific skills and in reducing the employment security of less skilled workers. But Tyson and Spence also note that markets are imperfect and that compensation packages are not determined solely by market value. They point to a growing body of research indicating that income generated by patents and intellectual property protections and by the market power of brand names flows primarily to upper-level management and the owners of capital.\nIn contrast, in Piketty’s view, the primary factors driving the rise in executive pay at the top are not technology or imperfect markets but eroded social norms, questionable corporate-governance practices, and declining union power. Tyson and Spence favor more research to weigh the relative impact of market forces and institutional factors but argue that either explanation provides a strong rationale for increasing the marginal income tax rate for top earners in an effort to combat income inequality.\nONE FOR YOU, TWO FOR ME\nAnother essential set of questions about inequality centers on whether wealth concentration negatively affects economic growth, shared prosperity, and democratic institutions. In his contribution to After Piketty, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, outlines a number of ways in which it might. One such potential negative effect is reduced aggregate consumer spending. Since lower-income hou\nDoc 3(Title: \"How Should Governments Address Inequality? | Foreign Affairs\") ted in the work force, as did 97 percent of those with a high school degree or less. By 2015, the rate for college-educated workers had fallen only slightly, to 94 percent, but the rate among less educated men had plummeted to just 83 percent. This drop reflects market forces and technological change, to be sure, but it also suggests shifting social norms and attitudes.\nHIGH AND NOT SO MIGHTY\nA growing body of evidence now indicates that inequality in the United States threatens to create intergenerational poverty traps, greatly reduce social mobility, and marginalize entire swaths of the population. Such effects are sure to have political ramifications. Piketty proposed that greater wealth inequality will increase the demand for egalitarian policy responses. But it also means that the wealthy, with their deeper-than-ever pockets, will be even better able to block such changes. Beyond that observation, Piketty doesn’t have much to say about the politics of inequality in the United States or elsewhere. As the social policy expert Elisabeth Jacobs points out in her contribution to After Piketty, politics is both “everywhere and nowhere” in Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-first Century: the problems Piketty identifies are inherently political, but he pays little attention to the crucial role that politics would play in any attempt to address them.\nUnfortunately, the same criticism applies to After Piketty. Many of the volume’s contributors assume that no matter what policy remedies for extreme inequality emerge, wealthy elites will marshal their considerable influence to maintain their position and privileges. But they do not explore those potential policies at great length, nor do they consider the precise mechanisms that would shape pushback from the elites.\nAfter Piketty would also have benefited from more discussion about whether recent political events challenge the notion that elites can overcome a wave of support for more redistribution of wealth. In 2016, the Brexit vote and the American presidential election revealed the strength of populist and nationalist sentiments among voters who gleefully rejected the elite classes in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Even in the wake of such surprising outcomes, the political economy models described in After Piketty tend to associate rising wealth concentration with growing political power of the elite—not the rise of populism. The watershed political events of 2016 call those models into question; in both the United Kingdom and the United States, elites saw their preferred choices lose out.\nE PLURIBUS UNUM?\nWhen it comes to the problem of income and wealth inequality in the United States, there are no silver bullets. But policymakers have many levers available to them. The best evidence suggests that the United States could have a more progressive federal income tax code without incurring substantial economic costs. Tax reform should focus on expanding the tax base by closing loopholes and eliminating regressive features such as the mortgage-interest tax deduction, which benefits only high-income homeowners, and the carried-interest loophole, which benefits only those involved in private-equity finance.\nThe federal government should take the additional revenue such steps would generate and invest it in programs that would increase the country’s economic potential. That would include improvements to public infrastructure, expanded access to high-quality childcare and preschool programs, and more spending on programs that assist economically disadvantaged youth. Government commitments to public universities and community colleges must be strengthened. At the same time, institutions of higher education must focus on helping their students build the skills they will need to succeed in a competitive, rapidly changing labor market. These types of investments are crucial if the United States is to remain a land of opportunity.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Fo\nDoc 4(Title: \"How Should Governments Address Inequality? | Foreign Affairs\") economic growth, shared prosperity, and democratic institutions. In his contribution to After Piketty, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, outlines a number of ways in which it might. One such potential negative effect is reduced aggregate consumer spending. Since lower-income households have a higher propensity to spend out of their earnings than do higher-income ones, the more wealth held by high-income households, the less overall spending the economy might see. Another potential problem is that wealthy Americans tend to vote for (and lobby for) lower taxes; increased wealth concentration, then, could lead to harmful reductions in government spending on public goods such as education and infrastructure. Nevertheless, Zandi cautions that the link between income inequality and aggregate U.S. economic growth is relatively weak. “There is evidence that extreme inequality, as prevails in some parts of the world, weakens economies,” he writes, “but inequality in the United States doesn’t appear to be significant enough for it to make a substantial difference to the economy’s prospects.”\nEven if the income of top earners reflects genuinely worthwhile contributions to society and does not impede economic growth, today’s extreme inequality does threaten social cohesion. I used to contend that economists and policymakers need not worry about inequality and should instead focus on reducing poverty and expanding opportunity. But after years of researching the topic, I’ve come to believe that policymakers cannot achieve those goals without directly addressing inequality.\nIn the winner-take-all economy of the contemporary United States, the gap between the top and the bottom has grown so large that it undermines any reasonable notion of equal opportunity. As inequality has increased, the country has witnessed a fraying of communities and institutions and deepening divisions along socioeconomic lines. Children from high-income homes are pulling further and further ahead of their less advantaged peers in terms of education, which means it is far less likely that children born into middle- or low-income homes will experience upward economic mobility. Americans celebrate “rags to riches” stories, but the data indicate that the United States has less social mobility than most European countries. Social mobility in the United States is not yet on the decline, but if current trends continue, it will be soon.\nToday’s extreme inequality threatens social cohesion.\nInequality also harms American society by encouraging negative perceptions of the economy and one’s prospects for upward mobility. If Americans view the system as rigged against them and see economic success as out of reach, they might give up on the celebrated American ideals of hard work and meritocracy. That may already be happening. Research I have conducted with the economist Phillip Levine shows that young men are more likely to drop out of high school if they live in places with higher levels of income inequality, all else being equal. This is consistent with evidence produced by psychologists showing that beliefs about inequality negatively affect people’s expectations of social mobility.\nThe alarmingly low rates of labor-force participation among young Americans and those of prime working age might also be driven, at least in part, by a sense of malaise shaped by today’s high levels of income inequality. Labor-force participation among American men aged 25 to 54 has fallen steadily since the mid-1960s, a trend that has been sharper in the United States than in other advanced economies. In 1964, 98 percent of such prime-age men with a college degree or more participated in the work force, as did 97 percent of those with a high school degree or less. By 2015, the rate for college-educated workers had fallen only slightly, to 94 percent, but the rate among less educated men had plummeted to just 83 percent. This drop reflects market forces and technological chang\nDoc 5(Title: \"Eight Ways To Reduce Global Inequality - Inequality.org\") bor need that is permanent while being denied the status of employment. In the United States, this trend is called “misclassification,” in which employers misclassify workers as “independent contractors” when they are actually employees. Contingent labor also occurs through outsourcing, subcontracting, and use of employment agencies.\n7. Open and Democratic Trade Policy\nNegotiating international trade agreements behind closed doors with only bureaucrats and corporate lobbyists present has to end. These old-style trade agreements are fundamentally undemocratic and put corporate profits above workers, the environment, health, and the public interest. We need a new, transparent trade policy that is open, transparent, and accountable to the people.\n8. A New Economics?\nEconomists are often imagined as stuffy academics who value arcane economic theory above humanitarian values. The field’s clinging to parsimonious theories gave us such winners as the Washington Consensus and a global financial system that imploded in 2008. Thankfully, there’s a movement among economics grad students and scholars to reimagine the discipline. As they acknowledge, we clearly need a new economics that works to improve the lives of everyone, not just those already well off. For instance, what could be more radical than a Buddhist economics? This is the path promoted by economist and Rhodes Scholar E .F. Schumacher, who says humanity needs an economics that creates wealth for all people, just not money for privileged people and corporations. Economics should take into account ethics and the environment, and treat its claims less like invariable truths.\nby Nick Galasso & Marjorie Wood\nBy taxing progressively, respecting worker rights, and rethinking economics, we could make a great start at creating a more equal world.\nInequality.org\n→ In Your Inbox\nGet the indispensable guide to the latest on our unequal world, in your inbox every Wednesday.\nYou can unsubscribe any time.

Fewer and fewer colleges are giving class rank much importance. According to the NACAC, fewer than half of high schools now track class rank.\nPersonal qualities. Some colleges look for signs of certain personal traits that they feel help students succeed in college, such as curiosity, social consciousness, or persistence. You might be able to get an idea of which traits your colleges value by reviewing their admissions websites and mission statements, or by asking an admissions counselor or current student what types of students succeed at the school. See 9 Personality and Character Traits Colleges Look for in Applicants.\nDo all colleges use the same criteria when admitting students?\nColleges don’t all consider the same factors when deciding whether or not to admit prospective students. Talk to a college counselor to learn about what your school of choice considers before accepting students. This can help you be prepared for college applications and interviews. Listed below are some examples.\n- Liberal arts colleges, which encourage students to study broadly, may give factors such as essays and demonstrated interest considerable weight.\n- Highly selective colleges attract thousands of outstanding students. These colleges typically look to the \"next-most important\" factors to make their decisions.\n- At very large universities, some admission decisions may be made solely based on GPA and test scores.\nColleges consider many factors when admitting students. Remember that different colleges take different factors into consideration during the admissions process. After learning more about these college admission secrets, do some research about the schools you are applying to and find new ways to stand out!\nDoc 2(Title: \"What Do Colleges Look For in Students? | CollegeData\") What Do Colleges Look For in Students?\nIt may seem top secret, but colleges are perfectly willing to reveal their most important admission factors. You just need to know where to look.\nColleges typically consider grades in tough courses most important in admissions. But what else do colleges look for? According to the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC), colleges list the following admission factors as the most important.\nWhat are the Most Important Factors in College Admissions?\n-\nGrades in college prep courses. Most colleges will consider your grade in college prep courses the strongest sign of your ability to do well in college. If you perform well in your AP courses, it suggests that you have the ability to take on the college workload. Even if you struggled early in your high school career, colleges will look favorably upon strong improvement in subsequent years.\n-\nStrength of curriculum. Colleges look for students who took the most challenging courses available to them who performed well in each class. Some high schools don’t offer many college prep classes. If that is the case for your high school, admissions officers will take this into account. They may also look favorably upon students who seek challenge outside of school; for example, by taking community college courses or AP courses online.\n- Admission test scores. Your SAT and/or ACT scores might count highly if the college requires or accepts them. Many colleges are now test optional, test flexible, or test blind. Scores from AP tests and the International Baccalaureate exams may also be important, especially to more selective colleges. To best prepare for your tests take a college test prep course or buy a prep book. This will help you study and determine the best way for you to conquer your test and receive the best score possible.\n- Grades in all courses. Your overall GPA also serves as an indicator of your academic success in high school. Colleges may look at your transcript to get an idea of how you performed in your classes. A transcript is a list of every class taken throughout high school and the grade received in each class. Some colleges will also look at the types of classes you took in high school and note whether you took honors and AP courses if they were available.\nHow to Get Into a Good College: The Next Most Important Factors\nExtracurricular commitment. Colleges pay attention to your involvement in extracurricular activities. But what counts most to colleges is how long and how deeply you have been committed to one or two of those interests. This could be sports, clubs, music groups, or various other activities. They take into account the leadership roles you have held, what you accomplished, and how much time you committed to the activity.\nLetters of recommendation. Many colleges require recommendation letters from your teachers and high school counselor. Other colleges may require additional letters from individuals who know you well and can provide insight into your academic abilities, character, and personality.\nEssay or writing sample. Many colleges will ask you to submit an essay or personal statement and some will require you to answer additional questions with shorter essays. Here is your opportunity to put your personality into your application. A well-written essay can tip a decision in your favor and a poorly written one can do the opposite.\nDemonstrated interest. Going on a college visit, talking with admission officers, or doing an enthusiastic interview can call attention to how much you really want to attend. Applying for an early decision may also make a good impression.\nClass rank. Colleges that use this factor want to see how much competition high school students had to face to achieve rank. Fewer and fewer colleges are giving class rank much importance. According to the NACAC, fewer than half of high schools now track class rank.\nPersonal qualities.

Of course, all colleges are different and IECA members can be particularly helpful in understanding those variances.\nAmong the key 2020 findings:\n- While grades are important (#2 in rankings), colleges want to see students challenging themselves, willing to risk perfect GPAs by taking courses that will demonstrate a willingness to take chances, including AP and IB coursework (#1).\n- Despite all the talk about “test optional,” scores on standardized tests like the SAT and ACT remain critical (#3)\n- Extra-curriculars rose to their highest level ever in the IECA rankings (#4), but colleges look for a long-term, passionate, authentic involvement in one or two activities whether in or out of school. No one is impressed by a long list of tangential clubs. In fact, jumping two spots (to #6) this year: demonstration of leadership within those chosen few activities.\n- Essays remain important and are even more important at smaller colleges. But students misunderstand their role. Yes, clear and cogent writing matters, but a great essay is one that tells a story, giving insight into a student’s unique personality. There’s a great saying—no one else should be able to write the essay you submit for admission.\n- Coming together are four items that speak to the question: what can YOU do for US? Colleges wonder how the student will contribute to campus life: through unique characteristics or demographics (#7), through special talents (#9), through interest in research (#10), and through demonstrations of a student’s character and values (#11).\n- How does a student demonstrate all those? Through the essay, the activities list, and through recommendations, which turned up as #8 on the 2020 rankings.\n- Finally, an area students often don’t understand is demonstration of interest and enthusiasm in attending (#12). Are you following the college on Facebook? Did you visit the campus? Seek an interview? Colleges don’t like to extend an offer of admission to a student who will go elsewhere, so when you decide on your first choice, let them know!\nThis ranked list is based on a 2020 nationwide survey of IECA member independent educational consultants.\nJust as every college is different, so too are the criteria and priorities in each college’s admission process.

Improving your company’s profitability can seem daunting, but, as a manager, you’re in a position where each decision you make could impact your organization’s bottom line. Like any significant goal, achieving this is more manageable when broken into smaller action items.\nHere are eight steps you can take to improve your organization’s profitability.\nFree E-Book: A Manager's Guide to Finance & Accounting\nAccess your free e-book today.\nDOWNLOAD NOWHow to Improve Profitability: 8 Steps for Managers\n1. Learn to Read Financial Statements\nThe first step is to familiarize yourself with three key financial statements: the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Here are several resources to get started:\n- The Beginner’s Guide to Reading & Understanding Financial Statements\n- Balance Sheets 101: What Goes On a Balance Sheet?\n- How to Read & Understand a Balance Sheet\n- How to Read & Understand an Income Statement\n- How to Read & Understand a Cash Flow Statement\nDetermine which pieces of these statements you can control as a manager. A baseline understanding of the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement can give you a clearer picture of what your business is spending and earning, and lead to productive conversations with other decision-makers about budgeting and efficiencies.\n2. Calculate the Profitability of Future Projects\nOne way to gauge the impact you can have on your company’s financial health is to calculate projects’ predicted profitability. There are three metrics to consider when doing so: net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period.\nThe net present value (NPV) is the amount of money a particular investment is worth to your organization today. This calculation takes both the time value of money—the concept that your money is worth more now than the same amount is in the future—and the inherent risk of investment into consideration. If a project’s NPV is a positive number, the project is expected to be profitable.\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that sets the NPV equal to zero. In other words, when using the IRR, your project would neither be profitable nor losing money. Your project’s discount rate must be lower than its IRR to be profitable.\nFor instance, if you were to find that the IRR for a project is three percent, but the project’s discount rate is five percent, you can predict that the project will not be profitable and pivot accordingly.\nThe payback period is how long an investment will take to pay back the initial cost. It’s useful to know how quickly you expect to see a return on your investment when pitching projects and planning budgets.\nRelated: Financial Terminology: 20 Financial Terms to Know\n3. Find Efficiencies in Your Processes\nAnalyze your company’s income statement and notice the expenses. Are there any items that can be eliminated by streamlining processes? Which line items do you have control over, and can any be reduced or eliminated? Conducting an audit of your expenses and pruning away process inefficiencies are necessary steps toward improving your company’s profitability.\n4. Create Budgets and Stick to Them\nKnowing how to create a budget is an essential skill for managers. Familiarize yourself with your firm’s budgeting timeline, procedures, and financial statements so you can create a budget that equips your team to complete projects that drive profitability and performance.\nTrack each action item your team completes so you can compare your actual spending against projected costs. This can allow you to learn from mistakes and make better financial decisions moving forward.\n5.

Organizational conflicts are can be observed as disputes that occur when values, goals or interests of individuals contradict each other. Even though conflicts are perceived as being negative, they are capable of increasing the organizational productivity and innovativeness, improving thus the organizational performance[24]. Why dysfunctions arise in public administration?\nDysfunctions are accompanied by tension and their consequences consist of animosity, low yield, stress, absenteeism, frustration, aggressiveness, fear, discontent and resentments. In order to sustain a high-performance, leaders and HR managers must keep an eye on the symptoms of dysfunctions arising in organizations, and they treat their root. The symptoms of the dysfunctions are usually attributed to a dictatorial or limited leadership under which the management does not allow disagreements fearing arrogance or insecurity; personal agendas which internally influence promotions and selections; unfair political compensations which are not linked to qualitative performances; inefficient use of resources allocated on the basis of power-centrism and favoritism; empire-building practices through which managers work on promoting themselves; unequal workload distribution where some departments are underused while others are overloaded; and over-management which hinders communication and causes slower execution; fragmented organizational efforts which cause interdepartmental competitions and lead to miscommunication and low productivity[25]. All these attributes lead to a dysfunctional public administration that lacks efficiency and responsiveness.\nD. Efficiency in Public Administration:\nAt the beginning of the progressive era reforms, efficiency was sought to rationalize and systematize the public administration’s business. Attaining efficiency justified the centralization of public functions, the existence of bureaucracies, and the presence executive budgeting. Efficiency is sought to promote public responsiveness to the citizen’s demands especially in a democracy. Efficiency is considered as a vital value that supports and undergirds the government’s broader values. Public administration scholars questioned the supremacy of efficiency as they tested the progressive separation of the administration from politics[26]. According to Waldo (1952), this separation did not go with the view that agencies were entangled in political maneuvering as much as they were legislatures. Therefore, if the administrators make decisions effectively, they cannot be considered as choosing the optimal method for policy decisions’ implementation. Furthermore, critiques of efficiency objected on the separation of means and ends: “means are relative to ends”, making thus the administration not an end in itself. Being efficient supposes choosing a handful a value which is at the core of the public agency and pursuing objectives without giving attention to the external influential factors. So, efficiency is about “getting things done”, with low considerations on how they are done. Lowering public service costs and minimizing waste are crucial[27].\nEfficiency in the public sector is identified through: the leadership (on the national level), the judicial system on the state level), the civil service on the institutional level) and the organizational structure. Corrupt practices involving political and bureaucratic influences, weak organizational structures, incompetent appointments render the public administration inefficient. The lack of checks and balances due to a weak judicial system also contributes to the public sector’s ills[28].\nIn a liberal democratic setting, the Public Administration is designed as an executive tool to serve citizen’s expectations.

In other words, an economy with little government intervention. The U.S. is currently under a system known as a mixed economy, which is basically a mixture of capitalism and socialism. Capitalism works well because of the way it deals with self-interest, distributes limited resources, grows standards of living, and provides incentives for excellence. We will discuss these four concepts in detail:\nSelf-Interest\n\"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interests.\" -Adam Smith\nThe prevailing interest among humans in this world is self-interest. Anti-capitalists call it greed. Religion calls it sin. Science calls it survival. In fact, few philosophies refer to self interest in itself as something good, but it is inescapable. You cannot educate people out of self-interest. It is the natural order of human behavior and the only way to tame this beast is to work with it. Dr. Walter E. Williams describes how capitalism works with self-interest:\n\"Capitalism is relatively new in human history. Prior to capitalism, the way people amassed great wealth was by looting, plundering and enslaving their fellow man. Capitalism made it possible to become wealthy by serving your fellow man.\" 2\nDon't take this as an argument that capitalism is perfect or produces perfect results. Far from it. However, capitalism is the closest thing to a perfect economic system we will ever see on this earth.\nLimited Resources\nThere are a limited number of resources in the world. Therefore, a system is needed that rations out these resources in a manner that benefits all the stakeholders. As we discussed in Gas Shortages previously, prices determined through supply and demand allow resources to be allocated to those who need them most. In the case of a crisis, the person with an empty tank of gas can buy what he currently needs most (because the price will be high enough to deter people who don't really need it).\nStandard of Living\nWhile political rhetoric often describes dire economic conditions and the woes of class separation, the truth is, people have access to more products and services than ever before. There are many ways to gauge the current standard of living, but let's discuss a few related to \"the poor\". Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation3 wrote using 1990 census data:\n- 38 percent of the persons whom the Census Bureau identifies as \"poor\" own their own homes with a median value of $39,200.\n- 62 percent of \"poor\" households own a car; 14 percent own two or more cars.\n- Nearly half of all \"poor\" households have air-conditioning; 31 percent have microwave ovens.\n- Nationwide, some 22,000 \"poor\" households have heated swimming pools or Jacuzzis.\nExcellence\nCapitalism is the only economic system in the world that promotes voluntary excellence in individuals. Individuals are rewarded based on the amount of value they provide to the market. Capitalism provides incentives to be great and invent things that were never thought possible. It is a system that promotes growth among individuals and society as a whole.\nWhile it would be impossible here to fully explain all the reasons why capitalism is the best economic system in this post, there are many books devoted to this endeavor. Some of these books include:\n- Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman\n- The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith\n- Free to Choose by Milton Friedman and Rose Friedman\n- The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism by Robert Murphy\n- Freedomnomics by John Lott\nSources:\n1. Capitalism. Wikipedia.\n2. Capitalism and the Common Man. Walter E. Williams. August 25, 1997.\n3. How \"Poor\" are America's Poor? R\nDoc 2(Title: \"Economics Paper: Why Capitalism Is the Best Economical System?\") The collapse of Feudalism in the late 16th century ushered about a world crossroads. The economic microcosm characterized by the family farm was expanding beyond known borders and rapidly crossing into unknown economic territory. The methods in which individuals acquired and sold goods shifted to mercantilism, which in turn formed the root basis of the capitalist model successfully utilized by many countries today (Wood). Capitalism is the paramount economic system because it provides limitless opportunity, encourages innovation, and has not been proven inferior to alternative economic systems.\nFirst and foremost, capitalist economic systems provide limitless opportunity for each individual. Capitalism is the only economic system which allows every individual an equal chance of success, regardless of inherited social class. Motivation for success hinges on the guarantee that there are no limitations on the acquisition of wealth. The guaranteed chance of success provided by capitalism inspires hard work, perseverance, and hope.\nMoreover, capitalism results in an overall increase of innovation and economic growth. In a capitalist driven economic system, consumers make decisions, or votes, on preferences for products and services. The providers of goods and services are therefore motivated to create the best product to win the consumer. Constant competition results directly in pressure for the producer to continually increase the quality of the product while maintaining price. In this way, the power that capitalism inherently bestows to the consumer drives a force for innovation. Without capitalism, innovation is not a priority. In addition to expanding markets, innovation also further increases efficiency, reinforcing and adding to the feedback loop. In recent years, innovation within capitalist economies has increased so rapidly that it has spurred the emergence of an entirely new economic doctrine. This doctrine, dubbed “innovation economics,” centers all economic models around innovation and entrepreneurship, as opposed to traditional models, which are based on public policy. Proponents of the innovation economy predict that exponential growth of capitalist economies is not only feasible, but probable (Schramm et al.).\nWinston Churchill, a British politician, was famously recorded stating that “democracy is the worst form of government, except all those others that have been tried” (Raymond). Similarly, capitalism is considered by many to be the best economic system by default due simply to the absence of a more successful model. Modern countries attempting variations of the communist economic system struggle to reach the standard of living which most capitalist countries have achieved (Malik). These countries are often plagued by governmental corruption and lack of motivation among workers. For example, the Chinese Communist Party was recently ranked 78th of 178 countries in the Transparency International’s Corruption Perception index. This ranking is the worst among comparable developed countries (“Corruption Perceptions Index 2013”). The communist USSR under Stalin’s rule suffered heavily due to shortages in basic consumer goods such as food and hygiene products. These shortages were attributed to a lack of motivation among workers to reach outrageous government production quotas (Fitzpatrick). In the last ten years, communist countries are tending towards legislation which increases privatization, causing a gradual governmental shift towards the capitalist model (Moscoso Boedo).\nFree people and free markets are the driving force behind the success of the capitalist model. No other economic model inherently bestows limitless opportunity and power to each individual. The temptation of success and power drives the economy forever forward, creating exponential growth, unprecedented among any other economic systems attempted to date.\nWorks Cited\n“Corruption Perceptions Index 2013.” Transparency International, 2013, www.transpa\nDoc 3(Title: \"Capitalist Economic System - Economics Help\") A capitalist economic system is one characterised by free markets and the absence of government intervention in the economy.\nIn practice a capitalist economy will need some government intervention, primarily to protect private property. (This is important to distinguish capitalism from anarchism, where there is absolutely no government present)\nFeatures of a capitalist economic system\n- Economic freedom. Individuals free to set up business and provide the goods and services they want.\n- Consumer sovereignty. Consumers free to decide which goods and services to purchase.\n- Limited government. Government intervention limited to the protection of private property and provision of public goods.\n- Finance sector. Capitalism requires a developed banking and financial system which can provide loans to companies and banking services to households.\n- Profit motive is seen as important for enabling an efficient distribution of resources and encouraging innovation and responsive markets.\n- Market forces. Goods and services are distributed according to ‘the invisible hand of the market’ – in other words, the allocation of goods is determined by market forces. For example, if demand rises, firms have an incentive to increase supply.\n- Flexible labour markets – easy to hire and fire workers.\n- Free trade. Low tariff barriers to encourage international trade.\nFriedman on Capitalism\n“There is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use it resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud”\n― Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (1962)\nExamples of capitalist economies\nAccording to this rank of countries by ‘economic freedom’. The US is ranked 12th. The UK ranked 13th. Source: Global Finance\n- Hong Kong\n- Singapore\n- New Zealand\n- Australia\n- Canada\nIn the real world, many economies which are viewed to have a capitalist economic system may have government spending taking up to 35% of GDP. This is because the government pays for welfare, health, education and national defence. However, the economy is still viewed as capitalist because in the area of private enterprise, firms are free to decide what to produce and for whom.\nEconomists who advocate capitalism\n- Friedrich Hayek – The Road to Serfdom (1944)\n- Milton Friedman – Capitalism and Freedom (1962)\n- Adam Smith – The Wealth of Nations (1776)\nAlternatives to capitalism\nA capitalist economic system is often contrasted to a socialist or communist economic system where economic decisions are made centrally by government agencies. In a communist economy, the means of production are owned collectively and the government has more say in what to produce, how to produce and how to distribute resources.\nAdvantage and disadvantages of capitalism\nAdvantages of a capitalist economic system\n- More efficient\n- Less bureaucratic\n- More innovation\n- Discourages discrimination and forces people to trade with each other – breaking down barriers.\nProblems of a capitalist economic system\n- Inequality. Capitalist economic systems invariably lead to inequalities of wealth and income. However, it is argued that this inequality provides an incentive for wealth generation and economic growth.\n- Monopoly. In a capitalist society, firms could gain monopoly power over consumers and workers.\n- Environmental problems. A capitalist society driven by the profit motive may take decisions to maximise economic income in the short term but at a cost of environmental problems in the long-term.\nDifferent types of Capitalism\n- Turbo-capitalism – free-market capitalism with little government regulation\n- Responsible capitalism – Free markets but also a social welfare net. More reflective of European economies with private markets, but strong government intervention\nRelated\nDoc 4(Title: \"Economics Paper: Why Capitalism Is the Best Economical System?\") ortunity and power to each individual.

First things first, data science is not a standalone industry but involves an overlap of three other disciplines – math and statistics, computer science and business knowledge.\nData science works in several steps that initiate by extracting required data, continues with data analysis and data processing, and finalizes with drawing insights from our data. The purpose of data science is to find different type patterns within blocks of information we just fed to it. And its magical skill dexterity has helped and is still helping us change the world in three gorgeously profound ways, let’s look into them 😉\nWe can predict the future (seriously)\nDid you know that the first one to predict coronavirus pandemic was actually a computer, not a person? We wrote a great piece about it in our Using AI and Data Science to Fight the Coronavirus Outbreak article, which explains how artificial intelligence from a Canadian surveillance app alarmed its users on the upcoming danger 10 full days before WHO did.\nNo wonder one of the greatest data science applications is future prediction. With machine learning’s great talent in recognizing data patterns, we are now able to forecast threatening health conditions, malfunctioning hardware pieces, infectious livestock diseases, gas leaks, data breaches, collision threats, fire hazards, etc.\nForecasting any performance failures in the transportation and manufacturing lines does not only conserve the company’s money and streamlines supply chain processes, but quite literally saves human lives.\nOne government official has also told us how data science and statistical techniques are currently helping to prevent possible terroristic attack happenings. By analyzing the tone, the wording and the overall message teenagers share in their social media pages, these agencies were able to prevent several massacres that otherwise would have gone undetected. Speaking of security, we’re moving to the next major advancement brought to us by data science.\nWe are getting much safer (luckily)\nSince we’ve managed to turn the first spark into a bonfire to scare those predators away, security has always been a primary concern to all humankind. So it’s no surprise one of the most powerful data tools we have today is being used ubiquitously by National Security Agency, law enforcement, government headquarters, immigration offices, police departments and other institutions aimed to keep all of us safe.\nThe picture painted in the “6 Underground” with Ryan Reynolds is quite literal, so if you’re planning to commit any crime without getting noticed you’ll need to execute an informational suicide or otherwise your logins, your transactions, your likes and your call records will easily give you away.\nWith smart scans, cameras, sensors and cloud storages keeping information up to forever, each of your movements is closely tracked, which, if we put aside a conversation about privacy, is great for our security.\nOne of the great examples of how data science is keeping us safe is adopted by banks and is proven to be highly efficient. If there is an occurrence outside a credit card user’s typical monetary sum, geographic location, IP address, purchases or simply a different withdrawal frequency, the said transaction is denied, the card is instantly blocked with the user receiving a new one. But getting ourselves smarter, richer and safer isn’t the only thing we get from using our data science and our statistical techniques, because as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart.

There are the obvious, banner headlines, of course: AI is everywhere and will change everything; Enterprises continue to move their infrastructure – and data – to the Cloud; GDPR will make data protection every company’s priority. But you knew all that. And maybe you were a bit skeptical of the grandiose claims anyway.\nWhat substantive changes are really taking place? What do you need to be aware of as you set your architectural and procurement strategy and make decisions in those areas? We set out to identify seven impactful changes taking place in the analytics arena, right now, and we present them to you now.\n- Hadoop is Fundamental\nYes, those Big Data project failure rates have been high. Yes, Spark has in some ways displaced Hadoop and increasing numbers of customers are running the former independently of that latter. So the industry blames Hadoop…and stops uttering its name. Hadoop must be dead, right?\nWrong! Everyone’s talking about Data Lakes now and, much of the time, that’s just code for Hadoop. And while, yes, many organizations are implementing their data lakes in cloud storage layers, they’re often using Hadoop ecosystem technologies to analyze that data. Beyond that, consider that cloud storage layers can be made to emulate HDFS, Hadoop’s file system, and you start to realize that when you ponder cloud Data Lakes and Hadoop Data Lakes, there’s a distinction without much difference.\nThe good news is that this year, Hadoop’s going to do what it always should have: see adoption by the Enterprise, without great fanfare. Hadoop will become one data tool among many, and will be used when it makes tactical sense. It’s the combination of data technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Warehouses that make the current analytics market so exciting.\n- Bye-Bye, Enterprise Stack BI\nEarlier this year, MicroStrategy, the Enterprise BI pure play, announced its concession to the companies that compete with it on the front-end, by introducing connectors to their products. MicroStrategy is doubling down on its belief that their back-end OLAP platform, and associated data governance capabilities, are where it can best monetize. The company also seems to have decided that competing on the visualization and dashboard side is difficult and, even to the extent that it can be successful, provides diminishing returns.\nWill the back-end be enough to sustain Enterprise revenue and supported growth? We’ll have to see. But one thing’s for sure: The monolithic Enterprise BI stack has become disaggregated and old dogs will need to learn new tricks.\n- Data Hierarchies\nMaybe you’re familiar with the concept of data hierarchy, in terms of data storage and its correlation with frequency of access. “Hot” data – that which is used most often – is sometimes routed to very fast storage like solid state drives, or even CPU memory cache. Colder data is often routed to older – but cheaper – spinning hard disk drives.\nWith the storage hierarchy well-established, we’ll start to see recognition for other hierarchies this year. For example, analytics involves work with everything from experimental data sets that may be relevant to particular teams or business units, to highly structured, vetted and consensus-driven data that is useful to the entire Enterprise. In the middle are structured data sets that – possibly due to size, or level of cleanliness – are seen as somewhat less than production-level.\nExperimental data sets sit best in a Data Lake. Highly vetted data sets are most logically kept in a data warehouse. And the mid-level data sets will likely live in Hadoop or Cloud storage, but will often be queried from relational databases, using SQL-on-Hadoop bridges like IBM Big SQL, Microsoft PolyBase, and Oracle Big Data SQL.\nAnother hierarchy might stratify data according to whether it will\nDoc 3(Title: \"Marketing the Future: How Data Analytics Is Changing - Knowledge@Wharton\") Data analytics helps marketers learn about their customers with target precision, from the movies they watch on Netflix to their favorite scoop of chocolate ice cream.\nData is ubiquitous, essential, and beneficial — except when it’s not.\nExperts warn that data analytics is at an inflection point. Growing concerns about security risks, privacy, bias, and regulation are bumping up against all the benefits offered by machine learning and artificial intelligence. Layer those concerns on top of worries about the coronavirus pandemic and how it has rapidly changed consumer behavior, and the challenges become clear.\n“What we’re seeing is a lot of chaos in terms of what is the right answer. And what we’re seeing is a change in strategy,” said Neil Hoyne, chief measurement strategist at Google and a senior fellow at Wharton Customer Analytics.\nHoyne said he’s in constant conversation with companies that are trying to figure out the future of data analysis. Google and other internet providers recently announced plans to phase out third-party cookies, which will strip marketers of a wealth of fine-grained information collected by tracking consumers across the web. Proactive companies are already pivoting, so they can be ready for a post-cookie, post-pandemic world.\n“The companies that are going to win are the ones who are using data, not guessing,” said Hoyne, who spoke along with other industry and academic experts during a Nov. 17 virtual symposium, “The Use of Analytics and AI in a Post-pandemic World.” The event was hosted by the nonprofit Marketing Science Institute, along with Wharton Customer Analytics and AI for Business at the Wharton School.\n“The companies that are going to win are the ones who are using data, not guessing.” –Neil Hoyne\nThe symposium touched on a wide range of topics under the umbrella of data analytics while keeping sharp focus on what’s ahead in the evolving world of artificial intelligence.\n“In trying to design the program today, we couldn’t ignore the obvious, which is 2020 has been the year of disruption and risks — and, hopefully, successful management of those risks,” said AI for Business Faculty Director Kartik Hosanagar, who is also a Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions.\nThe Risks and Rewards of Data\nMuch attention has been paid to all the impressive ways that AI and machine learning help companies by automating services, predicting patterns, and making recommendations that lead to greater sales and engagement. More than a third of Amazon’s sales come from its recommendation algorithm, for example, while YouTube’s algorithm drives 70% of the content watched on its platform.\nBut, Hosanagar said, the risks associated with AI need equal attention and priority from managers.\nAI can create social, reputational, and regulatory risks, even for companies well-versed in technology. Amazon scrapped a recruiting software with a gender bias; Twitter shut down a Microsoft chatbot that “learned” how to post racists tweets; and Facebook was sued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which alleged the platform’s targeted advertising violates the Fair Housing Act by restricting who views housing ads.\n“These are not small risks for the companies,” said Hosanagar, who strongly recommended business leaders create interdisciplinary teams to continuously monitor and evaluate data for bias.\nBias can be unwittingly baked into algorithms by the humans who create them. Symposium speaker Kalinda Ukanwa, a marketing professor at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business, offered a powerful example to illustrate the problem. “Rebecca” applies for a loan with an online bank that uses AI to determine the loan. She is rejected, despite having good credit. But if she enters the same information with one difference — her gender — she is approved.\nWhile the online bank may see an initial surge in business because of the ease of use, it may suffer long-term reputational\nDoc 4(Title: \"3 Major Ways Data Science is Changing the World Today\") e as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart. A part where he says his mega-neutrino bomb was secretly a saving vaccine “against humanity as the planet’s worst virus’. As in we humans suck and everything we touch turns to dust. But as it turned out, in the real world we humans are actually the good guys.\nNot only we collectively treat our planet better each year, but we also use our best minds, resources and efforts to protect it. Three industry leaders – Environmental Defense Fund, California Air Resources Board and Plant Labs – are currently working on the conjoint reporting platform, that by launching two satellites into space aims to track the present situation and any occurring climate change squarely.\nLikewise, governments and city officials are using data patterns to allocate resources more wisely in regards to traffic routes, street lights, water supply and other utilities. The ubiquitous rise of smart homes, solar power, and multilateral recycling helps developed countries to decrease energy consumption and increase their efficiency.\nThere’s even a yearly “Data Science for Social Good” event hosted by the same-name fellowship, where data scientists from all over the world get together to help mother nature and “tackle the problems that really matter”.\nConclusion\nIt turns out data matters are inextricably linked to our modern-day progress and the whole purpose of data science is to propel that progress deeper and further. Feeling in the mood for more playful insights?\nCheck out our other data science-related articles:\nDoc 5(Title: \"Data Science is Changing the World for the Better: Here’s How ...\") scientists collaborate to ‘tackle the problems that really matter’.\nIn the past its projects have seen analytics used to improve outcomes for rough sleepers in the UK, increase the efficiency of reviews in biomedical research, and identify the students most likely to struggle in an academic environment.\nSimilarly, data scientists with a competitive streak may already be aware of the competitions hosted on Kaggle – some of which also focus on social problems, like identifying households with the greatest need for welfare assistance.\nAs technology continues to progress, the influence data science has on the world around us will grow, and in some circumstances it represents our best chance of solving some of the planet’s biggest and most pressing issues.\nAbout the Author\nPrasad Kothari is an analytics and data science leader who has worked extensively building high-performing teams for various organizations and has provided consulting to many fortune 500 clients.

As a national community, we are much more informed today and aware of relevant issues largely due to the speed and efficiency of communication. As informed citizens, we put pressure on law makers to amend or introduce legislation in areas that we believe need to change. For example, Brodie's law was introduced in 2011 after a teenager ended her life due to bullying at a café where she worked. This law now makes it a serious crime (punishable by up to 10 years) to bully others in the workplace and holds spreads the responsibility of ending bullying.\nChanging Expectations of the Legal System:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to the change expectations towards our legal system. Years ago, laws were expected to regulate behaviour however people now expect the law to uphold individual rights as well as protect people from harm.

As technology is continually developed, with that comes features which may be used in a harmful manner to society. As technology's capability is being grows, the law should be changed and adapted to remain relevant and purposeful. An example of this is the Summary Offences Amendment (2007) as a result of mobile phones equiped with cameras being used as an 'upskirting' device alongside 'online piracy' laws. This legislation was changed to make this actions illegal and protect victims.\nChanging community values:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community values. Values across society changes over time. What people in society may consider important and relevant within one generation may alter over a transitional period of time. In order to remain relevant, the law must uphold and reflect the values and beliefs of society in the present time. For example, people's perspective revolving around issues such as Abortion (2004) have changed over time as well as the detrimental health impacts of smoking and passive smoking. As such, laws have been amended or introduced to reflect the changing values within the community for example the legalisation of abortion and the banning of smoking in pubs/clubs and in cars with minors.\nChanging community awareness:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community awareness. As a national community, we are much more informed today and aware of relevant issues largely due to the speed and efficiency of communication. As informed citizens, we put pressure on law makers to amend or introduce legislation in areas that we believe need to change. For example, Brodie's law was introduced in 2011 after a teenager ended her life due to bullying at a café where she worked. This law now makes it a serious crime (punishable by up to 10 years) to bully others in the workplace and holds spreads the responsibility of ending bullying.\nChanging Expectations of the Legal System:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to the change expectations towards our legal system. Years ago, laws were expected to regulate behaviour however people now expect the law to uphold individual rights as well as protect people from harm. As such, the law has needed to take a more active role to ensure that it remains relevant.

In railroads, mines, farms, mills, lumber yards, sweatshops, and construction sites, the common worker performed demanding and difficult labor in conditions that were often dangerous, unsanitary, unhealthy, exploitative, or otherwise harmful.\nUnions enjoyed no real legal protection and workers organized for better pay and conditions largely at their own risk. Virtually all of the legal and political structure was organized for the benefit of the corporations that controlled the lives of the workers they employed. When soldiers or police officers used violence to break up strikes, the violence was almost always perpetrated against striking laborers at the direction of company bosses. Those bosses often enjoyed cozy relationships with politicians who steered policies and crafted legislation to maintain the status quo.\nAll that, however, was about to change. The last century has witnessed an unprecedented change in the American workplace. Starting in the 1920s, major laws were passed that guaranteed protections, redistributed power, and regulated everything from wages to hours to union management to hiring practices. Racial minorities saw new laws reverse decades of discriminatory hiring practices, as did women, immigrants, older Americans, and other vulnerable groups. Laws were enacted to improve workplace safety, to prevent child labor, and to bolster unions while preventing union bosses from exploiting their own members.\nModern workers owe their comparatively cushy conditions to the efforts of the activists and organizers who appealed for fair pay and reasonable protections at the risk of being fired, jailed, beaten, or killed. Here's a look at a century of labor laws that lifted the average American worker out of a condition of poverty and subjugation and into one that offered a much greater degree of self-determination and profit sharing.\nYou may also like: How your state gets to work\nRailway Labor Act\nIn 1926, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Railway Labor Act after decades of high-profile labor strikes, many of which were violent and even deadly. The act compelled union workers and companies in the railroad industry—which witnessed some of the most significant labor unrest—to negotiate through arbitration, bargaining, and mediation before resorting to strikes. As the first federal law that guaranteed workers the right to organize and choose their own union leaders without company interference, the act was one of the most significant reforms in history up to that point.\nDavis-Bacon Act\nThe 1931 Davis-Bacon Act required all private companies that won contracts on any significant public-works construction projects to pay workers the so-called \"prevailing wage,\" which generally corresponded with union wages. The law was necessary because the country was in the throes of the Great Depression, millions were out of work, and labor bosses frequently exploited the desperation of the unemployed by offering take-it-or-leave-it wage ultimatums. The standard remains in place today and still covers roughly 25% of construction workers at any given time.\nNorris-LaGuardia Act\nThe Norris-LaGuardia Act, enacted in 1932, was a major victory for workers seeking to organize for better pay and conditions. The law protected peaceful union strikes and protests from federal court injunctions, which had long hindered union organization efforts. It also prevented companies from firing workers for joining a union and outlawed so-called yellow-dog contracts, which required prospective employees to sign a promise not to join a union.\nNational Labor Relations Act\nThe 1935 National Labor Relations Act is among the most important legislation in labor history and remains\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Evolution of Canadian Law - LawNow\") Since Canada became a country in 1867, Canadian law has evolved from that of a British colony to a sovereign state, including major developments like the Charter, the Criminal Code and the Divorce Act.\nEDITOR’S NOTE This article was first published in LawNow on May 5, 2017. It was reviewed by the author in 2025.\nWith the 150th anniversary of Confederation upon us, it is perhaps appropriate to reflect on the high points of 150 years of legal change in Canada. Such an exercise is always a challenge, of course, because what might be considered significant to some may be seen as minor or less important to others.\nIn this brief review, I will focus first upon “the grand scale”: those developments and changes which seem to me to have had the most impact on our national and social evolution over the last 150 years, and then discuss specific areas which likely have the most impact on the daily lives of Canadians.\nIndependence from Britain\nCanada in 1867 was focused mainly in the centre (what became the provinces of Ontario and Quebec); was predominantly white and was mainly of British extraction and English-speaking. While we think of 1867 as the year we became a new country, many of the powers we now take for granted as a completely sovereign state were still reserved for Britain to exercise on our behalf. Legally, the highest judicial authority in the United Kingdom – in the form of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council – was also the highest court of appeal for Canada. The legislation which is considered to be our founding document was an Act of the British Parliament – the British North America Act (now, The Constitution Act, 1867) – and it described the division of powers between the national Parliament and the provincial legislatures. It also set out some basic rules about how we would be governed but many other basic principles remained unwritten and were encompassed by the broad, general statement that our constitution was to be “similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.”\nCanada on its 150th birthday is a hugely different place. Constitutionally, we have moved from the status of being “almost still a colony” of Great Britain, to being a completely independent and sovereign entity. While this evolution has, of course, also included major events in other areas (politics, military, and so on), the most important legal steps have been in the form of both statutory and common (“judge-made”) law. One of the most significant took place in 1931, with the passage of the Statute of Westminster. Until 1931, the British Parliament had retained ultimate authority in most areas of jurisdiction, reserving to the government in London the authority to override or nullify laws passed in Canada (and the other Commonwealth Dominions) as it saw fit. The Statute of Westminster removed most of this authority from Great Britain and passed it to the legislative bodies in each country, including Canada. The exception for Canada was in relation to the power to amend our Constitution: by agreement among the provinces and Ottawa, the United Kingdom Parliament continued to retain this authority.\nWhen it came to legal rulings and decisions, however, the Judicial Committee continued to be our final court of appeal until 1949. That year, Parliament (in Ottawa) amended The Supreme Court Act to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee in London, making the Supreme Court of Canada our ultimate judicial decision-maker.\nThe final, and perhaps most important, milestone in our constitutional development as an independent country occurred in the early 1980s with the so-called “repatriation” (or transfer) of our final constitutional authority from the United Kingdom to Canada. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau led the way towards a truly “made in Canada” Constitution which included, for the first time, a written list of our most basic rights and freedoms, as well as a method for changing the Constitution itself. The Constitution Act, 1982 was signed into\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Evolution of Canadian Law - LawNow\") cation for the limitation of rights in a democracy like ours, would the violation of rights be allowed. Otherwise, the courts were given the task of fashioning an appropriate remedy for persons whose rights or freedoms had been infringed or breached.\nThe changes in Canadian laws and society flowing from the enactment of the Charter in 1982 touch virtually all aspects of our modern lives. Things which we take for granted in 2017 which resulted from enshrining our fundamental rights and freedoms include:\n- Sunday shopping (a result of our freedom of religion);\n- protection from improper and arbitrary government prying into our private affairs and the requirement for a search warrant before state officials can snoop around our private property (all parts of our rights to be protected from unreasonable search or seizure);\n- our right to speak with a lawyer if we are arrested or detained; to know all aspects of the case against us if we are charged with an offence, and to be treated fairly in the court system (all parts of our rights to fair trials);\n- the legalization of abortion (the rights of women to decide for themselves what will be done with their bodies); and\n- protection of the media from harassment or persecution for investigating and exposing government and political wrong-doing (part of the freedom of the press).\nMore recent Charter developments touching the most basic aspects of life in Canada include the legalization of gay marriage; the introduction of physician-assisted death; and innovations such as supervised injection sites.\nTo move from these general areas of how we govern ourselves, to more particular areas of law which touch our daily lives, reveals just as many examples of monumental change from 1867 to where we are today.\nCriminal Law\nIn the field of criminal law, for example, in 1867 most of our legal provisions were taken from the rulings of English judges, and the British Parliament. In 1892, however, Parliament enacted the first Canadian Criminal Code, which continues to be the main source of our criminal law today. Over the years since 1892, the Code has been amended often, in order to address new situations not foreseen in earlier years (it now includes computer offences, for example). Other amendments have included the abolition of all forms of physical punishment (flogging and hard labour, for example), and, in 1976, the death penalty.\nFamily Law\nFamily law, and divorce in particular, have also changed immensely since 1867. Until 1968 divorce was mainly governed by provincial laws which differed across the country. Many could only be divorced by an Act of Parliament: Someone wanting out of an abusive or otherwise bad marriage had to seek the assistance and support of their Member of Parliament who would introduce a Private Members Bill in the House of Commons declaring the marriage ended and the parties divorced. However, with the passage of the Divorce Act in 1968, the rules and procedures across the country were standardized, and all such matters were placed into the hands of the courts. Divorce became far more available and further change followed in 1986, when the Divorce Act was amended to simplify the situation even further through “no fault” divorces.\nAnother significant development over the last 150 years is the evolution of legal protections for spousal partners when it comes to the division of family assets. In 1867, after a divorce the ex-wife, and any children she might attempt to have living with her, were often left penniless. In the last 150 years, however, various support laws have been enacted so that now both former partners must share the obligations of child support and neither party is able to benefit unfairly from the marriage and its termination. In addition, property acquired during the marriage is to be divided equally between the former spouses, unless one side or the other can prove in court a significantly greater contribution.\nAnother major change in the area of family la\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that laws have changed over time due to various reasons such as changing community values, community awareness, technological advancements, and changing expectations of the legal system.

This question was also asked by NICKNACKPADDYWACK, holster2003, XX__JoJo__XX ( Jorja Howard ).0\nQuestion: Why is the big bang theory so widely accepted and are there any alternative theories?\n- Keywords:\n-\nSusan Cartwright answered on 14 Jun 2015:\nThe big bang theory is widely accepted because there is strong evidence in its favour, and because it arises naturally from the General Theory of Relativity, which is itself a well-tested theory. There have been several alternative models since the Big Bang was proposed in the late 1940s, but most of them failed observational tests. There is one currently supported alternative theory, which is more difficult to test, but relevant evidence should be forthcoming in the next few years.\nWhat is the evidence for the big bang? In order to establish this, we need to know what the Big Bang model predicts. Basically, we have the following arguments:\n1. In the Big Bang model, the universe is expanding – that is, the spaces between galaxies get larger over time. Incidentally, this is NOT the galaxies rushing away from each other through space: it is the expansion of space itself, rather in the way that spots on a spotted balloon get further away from each other as you blow up the balloon. This expansion was firmly established by Edwin Hubble and Milton Humason in 1931 (after an earlier but much less precise determination by Hubble in 1929), based on their distance measurements combined with spectroscopic evidence that had been accumulating since 1915 (it is often suggested that this was an unexpected discovery by Hubble, but that is not the case). This counts as a successful prediction, because the equations that describe the Big Bang expansion had first been written down by Aleksandr Friedman in 1922, and later rediscovered by Georges Lemaitre in 1927. (Hubble does not seem to have known about these predictions when he wrote his papers; he does not mention them.) However, it is not a unique prediction: other models, such as the Steady State model of Hermann Bondi, Tommy Gold and Fred Hoyle, also predict expansion. So we can’t really count it as strong evidence in favour of the Big Bang theory.\n2. In the Big Bang model, the universe has a finite age – if we run time backwards, everything becomes closer and closer together, and hotter and hotter, until you arrive at the beginning of time when the universe was (at least in the original version of the theory) infinitely hot and dense. Because light does not travel infinitely fast, when you look at distant galaxies you are seeing them as they were a long time ago. Therefore, the Big Bang predicts that distant galaxies should look much younger than the nearby galaxies we see around us. This turns out to be true: distant galaxies do look different from nearby ones, and some of those differences suggest that they are younger. The most obvious difference is that far more distant galaxies have active nuclei – that is, their central regions are emitting vast amounts of energy at all sorts of wavelengths – radio waves, X-rays, infra-red. This is probably caused by matter falling on to an extremely massive black hole (about 100 million or more times the mass of the Sun). The point is that we can calculate how long this kind of extreme activity is likely to last, and the result is much less than the age of our own Galaxy, or indeed our own Sun. So it is to be expected that such activity would be much more common when the galaxies were all much younger, and this is a good explanation of why we now see it as much more common in galaxies that are very distant (and so seen as they were billions of years ago).\nThis genuinely is evidence in favour of the Big Bang, because the most popular alternative model of the 1950s – the Steady State – held that although the universe was expanding, it was nevertheless infinitely old (new matter being continuously created to balance the expansion and keep\nDoc 3(Title: \"Why is the big bang theory so widely accepted and are ...\") y in 1950 knew how to detect these wavelengths, and the prediction was forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1965 by a group led by Bob Dicke at Princeton, and the same year it was observed – accidentally – by Penzias and Wilson. By 1968, it has been observed at enough wavelengths to show that it followed the Planck function, as far as could be checked (we now know that it follows the Planck function very precisely indeed). This was compelling evidence for the Big Bang – no other theory (then or now) could explain why the universe should contain a background radiation that obeyed the Planck function for a temperature a few degrees (2.725, to be precise) above absolute zero. The Big Bang has been the standard theory of cosmology ever since, and nobody has come up with any evidence to contradict this.The modern alternatives to the Big Bang accept pretty much all the evidence above. The main area of disagreement is what happened in the very early stages, long before even the formation of elements at 3 minutes. The standard description of this since 1981 has been a theory called “inflation”, which its inventor Alan Guth calls “a prequel to the Big Bang.” Inflation holds that a tiny tiny fraction of a second after the beginning, there was a brief period of enormously rapid expansion, much much faster than the speed of light (don’t panic – nothing can move THROUGH space faster than the speed of light, but space itself can expand as fast as it wants), and that our entire visible universe sprang from an incredibly small piece of pre-inflation space, about 1/100-billion times the diameter of an atomic nucleus. This explains why the universe we see is so uniform in all directions, which was a puzzle in the original big bang model. However, some theorists think that instead, the stage for the Big Bang was set by a collision between entire universes. These theorists believe that there are more than 3 space dimensions, and that our 3-dimensional universe is moving in a 4th space dimension and periodically collides with another 3-dimensional universe. The collision wipes out all the features of the universe and looks to later observers just like a Big Bang (which I suppose it literally was, but not in the way intended in the standard Big Bang!).\nIt is hard to tell the difference between the Big Bang + inflation model and the extra-dimensional collision model, because after the first tiny fraction of a second they basically look exactly the same. The possible solution is that inflation predicts faint ripples in the fabric of spacetime – “primordial gravitational waves” – which leave faint swirling imprints in the microwave background. You may remember that there was a big news story about a year ago, when a telescope called BICEP2 claimed to have found evidence for this swirling pattern. It turns out that they were probably wrong – they had underestimated the effects of dust in the Milky Way Galaxy – but more sensitive studies of this effect are being carried out. The extra dimensions model does not predict these patterns, so if they are found it will be evidence against extra dimensions and in favour of inflation.I’m sorry this was such a long answer, but it is an important question. Many people seen to think that the Big Bang is just a guess, and that scientists believe it because it’s in the textbooks. I hope that I’ve convinced you that this is not the case: the Big Bang is a valid scientific theory, and like all valid scientific theories it is still around after nearly 100 years because it has stood up to experimental test.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Why is the big bang theory so widely accepted and are ...\") f years ago).\nThis genuinely is evidence in favour of the Big Bang, because the most popular alternative model of the 1950s – the Steady State – held that although the universe was expanding, it was nevertheless infinitely old (new matter being continuously created to balance the expansion and keep the number of galaxies per billion cubic light years constant). The Steady State would have expected that galaxies would appear to have the same average age at any time, and thus at any distance – so there should not be more active galactic nuclei at large distance. This observation, which was first made in 1963, is therefore evidence against the Steady State.\n3. The Big Bang predicts that the early universe was very hot and very dense. This is because as you run time backward, the galaxies get closer and closer together, so eventually they all merge into one big lump. Therefore the early universe in the Big Bang model should be very dense. This was realised already in the 1920s: Georges Lemaitre talked about “the primeval atom”. Also, when something expands it usually cools down, because you are spreading energy over a greater volume, so the early universe should be very hot – this wasn’t really pointed out until the work of George Gamow and his students in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\nThis has two consequences. The first is that about 3 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe is comparable to the central cores of stars, where nuclear fusion reactions take place. Therefore, the free protons and neutrons that were formed even earlier can combine to make the first few nuclei of the periodic table: deuterium (the heavy isotope of hydrogen, with one neutron bound to one proton), the two isotopes of helium (He-3, with one neutron and two protons, and the much more common He-4, with two of each), and a little bit of lithium-7 (3 protons and 4 neutrons). Furthermore, the nuclear physics reactions contributing to this have been studied in the laboratory, and we know how they work, so we can calculate how much of each isotope should be made. It turns out that the amount of deuterium, in particular, is a very good test of the Big Bang, because deuterium is not made anywhere else: stars actually destroy deuterium, converting it to helium-4. The amount of deuterium we observe is as the Big Bang calculations predict, and it is consistent with the amount of He-4 we observe (He-4 _is_ made in stars, but the amount that we see in the universe is far too much to have been made by all the stars that have ever lived: most of it was made in the early universe). This is very good evidence for the Big Bang, because not only does deuterium exist in the universe, it exists at exactly the level predicted by the Big Bang calculation.\nThe second effect of the hot, dense early universe is that hot, dense materials give off light (think of a red-hot poker, a glowing coal, molten metal, an old-fashioned tungsten-filament electric light). What is more, the light that they give off is very precisely understood: it follows a law called the Planck function (first worked out by Max Planck in 1901), which depends only on the temperature of the material. Therefore, if the early universe was hot and dense, there should be left-over light from that period, and it should obey the Planck function – although, because of the cooling effect of expansion, its temperature should now be only a few degrees above absolute zero. This low temperature puts it in the microwave region of the spectrum, with wavelengths of millimetres (unlike visible light, which has wavelengths of tenths of a micrometre). This radiation was predicted by Gamow’s group in 1950, but nobody in 1950 knew how to detect these wavelengths, and the prediction was forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1965 by a group led by Bob Dicke at Princeton, and the same year it was observed – accidentally – by Penzias and Wilson. By 1968, it has been observed at enough wavelengths to show that it follow\nDoc 5(Title: \"3 Major Ways Data Science is Changing the World Today\") e as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart.

In scientific literature, major emphasis is placed on doping detection, whereas detrimental effects of doping agents on athletes' health are seldom discussed. Androgenic anabolic steroids are well known for their positive effects on muscle mass and strength. Human growth hormone also increases muscle mass, although the majority of that is an increase in extracellular fluid and not the functional muscle mass. In recreational athletes, growth hormone does not have major effect on muscle strength, power or aerobic capacity, but stimulates anaerobic exercise capacity. Erythropoietin administration increases oxygen-carrying capacity of blood improving endurance measures, whereas systemic administration of beta-adrenergic agonists may have positive effect on sprint capacity, and beta-adrenergic antagonists reduce muscle tremor. Thus, there are certain drugs that can improve selective aspects of physical performance. However, most of the doping agents exert serious side-effects, especially when used in combination, at high doses and for a long duration. The extent of long-term health consequences is difficult to predict, but likely to be substantial, especially when gene doping is considered. This review summarises the main groups of doping agents used by athletes, with the main focus on their effects on athletic performance and adverse effects.\nKeywords: androgen; exercise capacity; fat mass; growth hormone; lean body mass; side-effect.\n© 2014 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.\nPublication types\nMeSH terms\nSubstances\nLinkOut - more resources\nFull Text Sources\nMedical\nDoc 2(Title: \"19 Doping in Sports Pros and Cons – ConnectUS\") rmine the best training regimen to follow that maximizes results. Without this supervision, athletes are often forced to work on their own, which creates a higher risk to their health.\n7. Doping changes how the games would be played.\nIf doping continues unchecked in athlete competition, then it would require changes in the rules to accommodate the shifts in performance. We’ve already seen this happen without the involvement of PEDs as well. Goaltending rules in basketball were introduced to prevent removing the ball from the cylinder after players grew tall and strong enough to get above the rim. The end result of such an action would be a change in the rules, which would create the need for more doping, and that creates a cycle that would continuously repeat unless the performance enhancers were removed from the equation.\n8. Sportsmanship is reduced when doping is present in sports.\nPrograms that seek to remove doping as a viable activity for athletes want to preserve what is valuable about competition in the first place. Athletic competitions and games should be fun, build character, and offer a foundation of honesty. People excel through fair play, ethics, and teamwork. You must have a respect for oneself before there is an embrace of the true competitive nature that occurs during these events. Doping takes this away because there is no long-term self-respect involved. PEDs give you short-term gains at the expense of your long-term health.\n9. Doping as a professional teaches kids that it is an acceptable form of conduct.\nMany student athletes, including those in youth sports, look up to professionals who play the same game or a similar position as a role model. These people are a significant influence on the life of the child. Many will emulate how they train, work, and play the game as a way to get better. When these kids see their idol involved in doping as a way to get ahead of the competition, then they will be tempted to do the same thing. Professionals might have access to specialized medical care, but most youth will not.\n10. Sports would become an issue of access if doping were allowed.\nThe issue with doping often comes down to this specific disadvantage. Results in any event, at any level, would be based on the amount of access to pharmacological substances more than it would be skill and endurance. The teams that would win most often would be the ones where a majority of the players could afford PEDs and use them most effectively. Fans might be interested in outcomes, and players might be willing to trade glory for a longer life, but none of that changes the fact that taking drugs in sports becomes a competition between the haves and the have-nots.\nThe pros and cons of doping in sports always come back to choice and fairness. Should an athlete be able to use PEDs as a tool to help them be successful? If they make that choice, does that create a game or competition that is unfair? Sammy Sosa never won the World Series, hit over 600 home runs, and may never make it to the Hall of Fame. Others from the steroids era in baseball face similar circumstances. They might have another opinion on the matter.\nNatalie Regoli is a child of God, devoted wife, and mother of two boys. She has a Master's Degree in Law from The University of Texas. Natalie has been published in several national journals and has been practicing law for 18 years.\nDoc 3(Title: \"19 Doping in Sports Pros and Cons – ConnectUS\") o commit themselves to winning games, performing to high standards, and competing at higher levels feel compelled to make themselves stronger and better. Is it unethical for one athlete to train for 4 hours per day while another only practices for 60 minutes?\n5. Doping is something that is a part of sports for generations already.\nEven in 2000, when testing for PEDs and doping during the Olympics reached a feverish pitch, only eight people out of 110,000 athletes testing positive for a banned substance. The fact is that athletes who choose to take these methods use the advice of sports physicians and other specialized work from the medical community to “beat” the tests that would detect their usage of these substances in the first place. Athletes who want to compete at the highest level will look for ways to win. That has always been part of the game. Technologies make humans faster and stronger. Should they be banned as well?\n6. The rules of fair competition already use manipulative tactics.\nWe draw a thin line between what is morally acceptable in sports and what is not. People think of doping as something that is unethical because it gives someone a potential “edge” in winning. Then something like loading up on carbohydrates before an extensive endeavor is seen as acceptable because it gives that person “energy.” One could say that it takes more courage to place your health at risk through the use of PEDs than it does to eat four potatoes the night before a competition.\n7. Items classified as doping products are often vouched for as a safe item.\nThe Food and Drug Administration in the United States, the National Institutes of Health, and even the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists all vouch on some level that human growth hormone is safe to take. This substance appears on the WADA code as a prohibited substance or method that runs against rules of fair play and character. Isn’t it time we look at the purpose of what an athlete is attempting to accomplish instead of how they take care of themselves? People who follow the “spirit” of a sport will continue to do so, whether they take HGH or like to eat steak every night for dinner.\n8. Performance enhancing drugs are often see as illicit drugs by students.\nThere will always be some students who take steroids or other PEDs because they see their favorite athlete doing the same. That element of permission has always been involved in the youth-athlete relationship. Students will drink the same sodas, buy the same foods, and purchase the products that their idol pitches because it makes the relationship feel closer for them. Survey data suggests that steroid use amongst teens is similar to the trends of other drugs that young people take, including marijuana and cocaine. There’s a good chance that teenage boys taking steroids to workout longer are wanting to look more attractive more than wanting to perform better.\n9. Fans are interested in the outcome of the game more than player health.\nDid you know that there were only 10 players in the NFL that weighed more than 300 pounds in 1986? There are more than 300 professionals at that weight limit or higher today. No one cared that Mark McGwire was taking nandrolone when he competed during the 1998 season to break the all-time home run record in baseball. Although there are always exceptions, fans are generally more interested in the outcome of a game more than they are the way a player gets ready for it. They want results. Doping, right or wrong, helps to create those results.\nList of the Cons of Doping in Sports\n1. Performance enhancers have a negative effect on long-term health.\nDoping activities create the potential of long-term negative health effects, even if they do offer added strength to a person’s tendons, bones, and muscles. What is often ignored are the long-term consequences of taking this drugs or hormones, which can include acne problems all over the skin, impotence in men, issues with balding, and difficu\nDoc 4(Title: \"Why is doping wrong anyway? - The Conversation\") Revelations of doping typically provoke moral outrage. The received view is that doping is morally wrong because it’s cheating, and those caught doing it should be punished.\nThe rhetoric of the media, the World Anti-Doping Association (WADA) and sporting officials – and, in the Rio Games, some athletes themselves – all embody this idea. But why is doping morally wrong? Would it be morally wrong if it wasn’t against the rules?\nAthletes who dope are seeking to gain a competitive advantage over their rivals. But athletes seek to gain competitive advantages in numerous ways and many of these are not banned.\nIf it’s wrong to enhance your performance by doping, why is it not also wrong to enhance your performance by taking dietary supplements, for instance, or carb-loading, or by training at altitude?\nIdentifying the moral culprit\nBanned substances are typically synthetic so they artificially enhance athletic performance. If the point of sport is to test the natural limits of human nature then, by artificially extending those limits, doping is at odds with the essence of sport.\nMany banned substances, such as anabolic steroids, are synthetic. But many naturally occurring substances, such as Erythropoietin (EPO), and techniques that involve no synthetic substances, such as blood doping, are also banned.\nConversely, many synthetic enhancements are permitted. Think of the latest in streamlined clothing, cycling helmets, and running shoes.\nAnother problem could be the intended effect. Blood doping is supposed to increase red blood cell supply, thereby increasing stamina. But other means of achieving this effect are permitted by WADA.\nAltitude tents, for instance, are currently not on WADA’s prohibited list. But even if they were, would WADA also prohibit athletes from going to high-altitude locations to train, which has the same effect?\nPerhaps the real problem lies with the coercive effect of doping: the so-called “arms race”. If some athletes are at an advantage because they are doping, it puts pressure on others to dope too.\nBut elite sport is already highly coercive.\nTo remain competitive, athletes have to submit themselves to harsh training regimes and controlled diets that potentially cause long-term harm. If such measures produce better results, then all athletes have to adopt these measures.\nYet no one suggests there’s anything wrong with this kind of coercion in sport.\nCheating and unfair advantage\nThe moral outrage points to a simpler reason for the wrongness of doping. Doping is cheating because it’s against the rules. But why is it against the rules? Because it’s cheating, of course!\nThis argument moves in an embarrassingly small circle. And it doesn’t help to expand the circle: doping is cheating, and cheating is wrong, so doping is wrong. But why is doping cheating? Because it is banned.\nAnd so we arrive at the nub of the problem: what justifies the rule banning doping in the first place?\nThe most obvious answer is that doping confers an unfair advantage. But the advantage is only unfairly gained because doping is banned: by contravening the rules the doping athlete gets an advantage that her more rule-abiding competitors don’t get.\nThere are lots of ways in which athletes seek to gain advantage over their rivals: by using the best coaches, training techniques, dietary regimes, and so on. But we view these methods of gaining advantage as fair because they are within the rules.\nThe unfairness of the advantage secured by doping seems to be conferred simply by the fact that it is against the rules, and therefore cheating.\nA way forward\nIf there’s no prospect of a clear, non-arbitrary justification for why doping is wrong, one option would be to allow doping in some form or other. Many find that unappealing, presumably because the moral intuition that doping is wrong is so strongly felt.\nBut if it is to be maintained, we need to find another way of justifying it.\nHere’s one suggestion: give up the view that doping is intrinsic\nDoc 5(Title: \"Play the Game - What is wrong with doping?\") What is wrong with doping?\nThe prospect of genetic doping does not change the main objections against doping in sport.\nThis document lists the main arguments used in different anti-doping strategies.\nThe term ‘doping’ refers to doping substances on the IOC/WADA-list of prohibited substances and to different performance enhancing techniques like for instance blood doping.\nDoping is damaging for the athletes’ health\nWidespread use of performance enhancing drugs entails a risk to the athlete.\nEven though doping treatment in most cases is carried out under medical supervision there is still considerable uncertainty about potential side-effects and long-term consequences for most of the prevailing drugs.\nA counter argument is that athletes are human beings with their own free will and should be allowed to decide for themselves whether they are willing to take the risks involved in the use of doping.\nIt is a paradox that health and risk-taking are used as arguments against doping, since engaging in rigorous training for high performance sport in general is unhealthy and pose great risks to the athletes involved. Objectors to doping thus argue for the maintenance of the ban against doping in order to protect the athletes from getting harmed by their own free decisions.\nDoping is harmful to other athletes and the sporting environment\nA much used argument against doping is that doped athletes coerce their non-doped and reluctant opponents into doping themselves to keep a competitive edge. Forcing athletes to engage in practises they strongly oppose makes doping an unethical practice.\nClaudio Tamburrini, Senior Researcher at the Department of Philosophy, GothenburgUniversity, sees no problems in the suggested coercion in high performance sport.\nAccording to him “benefits should be distributed in relation to efforts and risks undertaken”. If an athlete compromises his own health to attain victory, while others are more cautious, it is in Tamburrini’s eyes only fair that the former gain his laurels.\nBroadening the perspective there is a risk that a general acceptance of doping in high performance sport will spread to other parts of the sporting environment and yield great social harm.\nDoping entails unfair consequences for the athletes and the sport itself\nThe rationale underlying the argument of unfair competition is that the doped athlete gains an advantage by enhancing himself with the use of prohibited drugs which is unfair to the clean athlete.\nHowever, high performance sport of today is not fair in itself. The unequal financial background of the athletes together with the unequal access to new training methods and modern equipment and facilities places an inherent inequality on modern day sport.\nLifting the ban on doping, as suggested by liberal sports scientists, would give all athletes the same starting point in theory. However, such a move would not make sport more fair overnight, as the economic inequality and hence the uneven distribution of doping drugs and strategies would maintain the unfairness implicit in doping.\nDoping is essentially contrary to the spirit of sportA true sporting contest is a struggle between two or more opponents abiding by the same standardized rules with the aim of establishing the true differences in sporting skills.\nFairness in the contest requires that the outcome of the competition will be settled exclusively on grounds of athletic ability. Use of illicit drugs to enhance performance is against the rules, which is why a contest between a doper and a non-doper is unequal from the very beginning and therefore not a true sporting contest.\n“Drugs are unnatural” claim the objectors to doping (even though many doping substances are naturally found in the human body). Rather than being a contests between persons and their athletic skills, sports contests between doped athletes are likely to be transformed into struggles between the best medically and technologically administered body.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, doping in sports is bad because it has negative long-term health effects, it coerces athletes into taking unnecessary risks, it undermines the integrity of sports by creating an unfair playing field, and it goes against the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play. The use of performance-enhancing drugs gives athletes an unfair advantage, which can lead to a cycle of increased use to maintain competitiveness. This not only harms the individual athlete but also taints the sport overall.\n\n<answer> it goes against the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play </answer>\n\nAfter considering the multiple reasons given, one overarching theme is that doping goes against the fundamental principles of fair play and sportsmanship, making it inherently bad."

He explains some of those tactics in this Fuqua Q&A.\nDo these companies really pay no income taxes?\nWe cannot truly know the answer to that question because tax returns are private. So when people say, for example, ‘Amazon paid no taxes,’ they are likely referencing tax cost estimates included in a company’s disclosed financial accounting statements, such as annual 10K filings with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).\nAmazon is an example that comes up repeatedly, so I took time to review financial statements from 2012 to 2018, which show Amazon reported $25.4 billion in domestic pretax profits and paid about $2 billion in federal taxes. That’s an 8-percent rate. Although this is a rough calculation, and quite low relative to the official corporate tax rate of 21 percent, it is not negative or zero.\nWhy do people believe these large companies aren’t paying?\nPeople often look at the pre-tax profits of a company in their SEC filings and compare those figures to the company’s “current provision” for U.S. income taxes.\nEvery year, many companies report large profits and very low or even negative taxes. For example, Salesforce reported about $2.5 billion in pre-tax U.S. profits in 2021, but reported a current federal tax expense of negative $12 million.\nHow do these companies end up with relatively low tax rates?\nThere are lots of ways companies can reduce their tax burdens. For example, some companies generate large deductions from capital investments (e.g. FedEx paid very little tax in 2018 because deductions from capital expenditures offset most of the tax bill). Many companies generate tax credits for investments in research and development or sustainable energy.\nMany companies, including Amazon, Google and Salesforce, also cut their tax bills by using restricted stock units (RSUs) for a portion of employees’ compensation. When granting the RSU to an employee, a company is not allowed to claim a tax deduction until the shares vest. If share prices are rising, the value of the shares at vesting can be much more than the value at grant date, and the tax deduction is therefore larger than the value on the date they were granted.\nSuppose a Salesforce RSU vested four years after it was given to an employee. For example, it was given at a price of $90 in June of 2017, but when it vested in June of 2021, the price was $238 (see Salesforce stock prices here). The employee would have to pay taxes on the $238 just like they had been paid in cash, and Salesforce would receive a deduction for $238, as though they had paid the employee in cash.\nEverything seems fine there, but what’s interesting is the way the amounts are reflected differently in financial accounting versus in tax deductions. Salesforce would record financial accounting expense equal to the price at the date of grant ($90).\nAccounting rules do not require an additional compensation expense if the share price increases. As a result, Salesforce never records the difference of $148 in compensation expense on the financial statements, which makes it look like it has really high financial accounting income.\nThe reason for the tax deduction is t\nDoc 2(Title: \"How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax\") It is not unusual for large U.S. corporations to pay no U.S. income taxes despite making billions of dollars in profits. In fact, one study of corporate securities filings found 55 of America's largest companies paid no income taxes in 2020 despite generating hefty profits, while netting $3.5 billion in aggregate tax rebates. Nearly half of those companies paid no U.S. income taxes for three successive years.\nAmong those not paying income taxes for at least three years were profitable blue chips Nike, Inc. (NKE), FedEx Corp. (FDX), and Salesforce, Inc. (CRM).\nHow do profitable corporations get away with paying no U.S. income tax? Their most lucrative (and perfectly legal) tax avoidance strategies include accelerated depreciation, the offshoring of profits, generous deductions for appreciated employee stock options, and tax credits.\nKey Takeaways\n- Large companies use a maze of tax breaks and deductions to minimize and often eliminate their corporate income tax liabilities.\n- Recent efforts to limit profit shifting to lower-tax countries have not been cost-effective.\n- Accelerated depreciation, tax credits, and the expensing rules for employee stock options are other ways large companies cut their tax bills.\n- The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a new alternative corporate minimum tax, while doling out $369 billion in additional tax credits over a decade.\nCorporate Tax Rate and Receipts in the U.S.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 set a flat 21% U.S. corporate income tax rate, replacing the 35% top marginal rate in effect previously.\nProponents of lower corporate taxes had long complained about the 35% U.S. rate as one the highest among advanced economies. Starting in 2018, the TCJA reduced the combined federal and state U.S. corporate income tax burden to the middle of the pack in rankings by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) based on the effective tax rate.\nBy other measures, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered a much more generous windfall for U.S. corporations. Corporate income tax receipts fell from 1.9% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 to 1% of GDP in 2020. The OECD average stood at nearly 3%.\nIn 2018, U.S. corporations paid a 7.8% average cash effective tax rate on their U.S. income, versus 18% for the income they earned on the territory of the 10 largest U.S. trading partners.\nThe Real Tax Rate vs. the Official Rate\nThe difference between the 21% statutory corporate income tax rate and the effective rate based on the cash taxes companies actually pay is the result of generous tax breaks doled out by U.S. Congress.\nThe 379 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 11.3% on their 2018 income.\nOne of the rationales for lowering the corporate income tax rate in the debate over the TCJA was that the cut would be offset by the elimination of tax breaks and loopholes for large companies. While the new law dropped some tax subsidies, it introduced many new ones.\nImportant\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a 15% minimum income tax on corporations earning at least $1 billion annually. The 2017 TCJA eliminated the prior version of the corporate alternative minimum tax.\nCorporate Tax Loopholes in the U.S.\nClearly, corporations have become extremely savvy at finding ways to pay less in taxes. For example, when Congress passed the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, payments to families under the legislation stole the headlines. The restoration of the carryback provision for corporations' net operating losses (NOLs) not just for 2020 but also for 2018 and 2019, on even more generous terms than those that prevailed before elimination in the TCJA, received considerably less notice.\nListed below are several key corporate tax-avoidance strategies. The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing the CEOs of the largest corporations, notes many of the tax breaks that can leave some companies owing no f\nDoc 3(Title: \"How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax\") ailed before elimination in the TCJA, received considerably less notice.\nListed below are several key corporate tax-avoidance strategies. The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing the CEOs of the largest corporations, notes many of the tax breaks that can leave some companies owing no federal income tax for some years continue to enjoy strong bipartisan support.\nOffshoring Profits\nThe TCJA moderately reduced but did not eliminate the enormous savings corporations realize by shifting profits from the U.S. to countries with lower tax rates. This can be done by shifting intellectual property to a subsidiary in a tax haven and charging U.S. corporate affiliates more to use it, among other tactics.\nProfit shifting to lower-tax countries reduced taxable income reported in the U.S. by $300 billion annually, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018, and changes under the TCJA were expected to slow the annual profit shifting by $65 billion.\nAt the statutory 21% U.S. tax rate, this $65 billion in reported profits not shifted abroad as a result of the TCJA would produce annual tax receipts of about $13.7 billion. Of course, as already noted, the effective tax rate for U.S. corporations is significantly lower.\nOffsetting such potential savings under the TCJA were the costs of a shift to a system reducing U.S. taxes on the earnings of overseas subsidiaries, while offering a tax break on foreign income derived from intangible assets in the U.S. Those provisions were expected to save U.S. multinationals $422.1 billion in U.S. taxes over a five-year period through 2024.\nThe TCJA did impose two new taxes on the overseas earnings of U.S. multinationals. Those companies' global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), defined as overseas income in excess of a 10% return on tangible assets overseas net of depreciation, is now subject to U.S. taxation at a 10.5% rate, rising to 13.125% in 2026.\nAnother TCJA \"stick\" designed to curb profit shifting, the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), imposes a minimum tax of 10.5% on the sum of a corporation's taxable income and its tax deductible payments to foreign subsidiaries other than for cost of goods sold. BEAT applies only to companies with annual gross receipts averaging more than $500 million over the three prior years that also make more than 3% of their total deductible payments to foreign affiliates.\nU.S. tax receipts from GILTI and BEAT were expected to total $198.2 billion over TCJA's first decade through 2027.\nAdding up the credits and the debits, the TCJA's attempts to curtail profit shifting appear to be costing the U.S. Treasury significantly more than what they save. Meanwhile, the business of tax havens has been largely unaffected. In 2019, corporate profits reported in Bermuda were more than four times the size of the island country's annual GDP.\nAccelerated Depreciation\nWhen companies acquire capital assets like buildings or factory equipment they can then deduct their depreciation cost from profits over a period of years deemed to represent those assets' useful life. Accelerated depreciation allows a company to write off more of the cost faster, providing a larger deduction up front against taxable income.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowed companies to deduct the full cost of such qualifying investments in the year they were made from 2018 through 2022. Bonus depreciation declines to 80% in 2023, 60% for 2024, 40% in 2025, and 20% in 2026 before elimination in 2027.\nThe congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates accelerated depreciation of equipment will save companies more than $130 billion in federal taxes between 2020 and 2023.\nTax Credits\nThe U.S. tax code is riddled with a variety of tax breaks for businesses estimated to cost the Treasury more than $100 billion annually, though that's a small proportion of total U.S. tax expenditures of about $1.6 trillion annually, including associated spending and foregone payroll and excise tax receipts.\nThe\nDoc 4(Title: \"How The Super Rich Avoid Paying Taxes\") If you're one of the 1% of Americans who control over 40% of the country's wealth, life is full of choices. Among them -- how best to keep all that money away from the government? The U.S. economic system offers no shortage of loopholes allowing the ultra-rich to shortchange Uncle Sam.\nTax rates for those making >$1 million level out at 24%, then declines for those making >$1.5 million. Those making $10 million a year pay an average income tax rate of 19%. $70-$100 billion is the estimated tax revenue lost each year due to loopholes. So how exactly do the super rich hide that much money from the government every year?\nDoc 5(Title: \"How Big Companies Avoid Big Tax Bills | Duke's Fuqua School of Business\") ot require an additional compensation expense if the share price increases. As a result, Salesforce never records the difference of $148 in compensation expense on the financial statements, which makes it look like it has really high financial accounting income.\nThe reason for the tax deduction is that share-based compensation dilutes the value of existing shareholders the same as if cash had been paid to the employee. To that end, the employee pays taxes just as if he or she had been paid in cash, and the company receives a tax deduction just as if the payment had been cash.\nWhat tax impacts could this have on the employee?\nThe tax burden to the employee is exactly the same as if the employee had been paid cash. And the tax deduction to the company is exactly the same as if the company had paid cash. The difference is that the accounting treatment results in a lower recorded compensation expense on the firm’s financial statements.\nSo, in the end, the company isn’t saving taxes relative to what it would have owed if it paid employees in cash. Instead, the company is reporting artificially high income in its financial reports.\nThis high income is not an accounting trick. The companies are following the rules. There is a long, contentious history about how to account for share-based compensation. Current accounting rules, which resulted from that contentious debate, are not perfect.\nThe accounting results in a situation where, if stock prices are rising quickly (like Salesforce, Amazon, Tesla, and others), the compensation expense recorded on financial statements is likely lower than the economic cost to the company. The opposite occurs, too, but doesn’t make headlines. If stock prices are dropping, the compensation expense will be more than the tax deduction, resulting in extraordinarily high tax rates for the company.\nThis story may not be republished without permission from Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business.

Growing up – moving on – By 1972, hippies had achieved many of their initial goals of “Turn on, tune in, drop out” – now it was time for them to move on and prove, in real life, that their ideals may work. The 1970’s, therefore, became a time where the Baby Boomers took various paths to start their families and careers.\nThe most successful commune in US History, The Farm, started in the early 1970’s as a way to bring ideals of the counterculture into work and practice. The 1970’s also saw the birth and rebirth of various religious and spiritual movements including Eastern Religions such as Buddhism. Many cults and other such groups (EST, etc.) also formed during this period.\n4. Mainstreaming – Many baby boomers decided they were not, after all, hippies…and decided to join the mainstream culture or further pursue of a career. Many carried some of the ideals of the 1960’s forward by choosing vocations in social services, medicine or other “right livelihood occupations.\nDoc 2(Title: \"The Death of the Hippies - The Atlantic\") The Death of the Hippies\nThe photographer Joe Samberg remembers how drugs destroyed the Telegraph Avenue scene.\nIn 1967, just after the Summer of Love, The Atlantic published “The Flowering of the Hippies,” a profile of San Francisco’s new youth culture. “Almost the first point of interest about the hippies was that they were middle-class American children to the bone,” the author noted. “To citizens inclined to alarm this was the thing most maddening, that these were not Negroes disaffected by color or immigrants by strangeness but boys and girls with white skins from the right side of the economy ... After regular educations, if only they’d want them, they could commute to fine jobs from the suburbs, and own nice houses with bathrooms, where they could shave and wash up.”\nA middle-class boy from the right side of the economy: That was my mother’s cousin Joe Samberg. When they were growing up, she spent every Thanksgiving at his family’s home in the upscale Long Island suburb of Roslyn Heights. His father was a successful businessman who, somewhat incongruously, had far-left sympathies. Throughout the 1960s, Joe and his four brothers became more and more radical. Two of the Samberg boys eventually went down to Cuba to cut sugar cane for Castro’s revolution.\nIn 1969, when Joe was 22, he moved out to California. By then, the Haight-Ashbury scene described in the Atlantic article had mostly migrated across the bay to Berkeley’s Telegraph Avenue. Rents were a little cheaper there, and for those who couldn’t pay rent at all, the weather was a little warmer. The college town was also more sympathetic to the long-haired kids who crowded the sidewalks day and night—talking, protesting, kissing, dancing, fighting, and taking lots and lots of drugs.\nJoe was part of it all, but he was also slightly outside of it, watching everything through the lens of his camera. Years later, when he was a highly regarded professional photographer—after he’d settled down and raised three children (including the comedian Andy Samberg)—he showed me some of his early portraits from Telegraph Avenue. They’ve been in my mind’s eye ever since, a counterpoint to all the popular images of peace signs, daisy chains, and Aquarian circle dances. The reality Joe saw was very much like the one the Atlantic author described: hordes of kids who had been lured to California by utopian ideals and then settled into a life of sex, drugs, and lethargy.\nJoe often quips that he headed out west for the same reasons as Jojo in the Beatles song: “for some California grass.” But like most kids who landed in the San Francisco area during the late 1960s, he had very personal reasons for leaving his old life behind. In 1965, his college girlfriend was killed in a car accident just as they were starting to talk about marriage. Six months later, his mother died of cancer. “I really started to sink,” he says. “I couldn’t concentrate. I couldn’t find anything about school that would hold my attention for very long.”\nSo he dropped out of Emerson College and moved down from Boston to Manhattan, where he found work at a color lab in midtown. He spent his free time in Harlem, seeing James Brown and other R&B singers at the Apollo Theater, or in the rough alphabet streets of the East Village, hanging out in Andy Warhol’s orbit. He watched the Velvet Underground play at the Exploding Plastic Inevitable, then went back to dilapidated apartments to snort meth. “What I was doing was grieving,” he says now. “But I was too young to understand that. All I knew was I was desperate to feel good again.”\nIn 1969, just after he got laid off from his job, his youngest brother, Frank, came to town. Frank had been living out in Berkeley, and he persuaded Joe to head back there with him. The drive took three or four days, almost all of it through dreary, frozen fields. They crashed on a floor somewhere in Ohio. In Wyoming, after they locked themselves out of their car, the local sheriff let them in, looke\nDoc 3(Title: \"united states - What was the hippie movement? Why did it ...\") I'll start by divvying Hippy culture up into two baskets: Fashion and Cultural Attitudes. The Fashion changed, because that's what fashions do. The attitudes, well some changed because the world around them changed, but some stay with us today.\nFashion is thing like clothing, art, music styles, hair styles. These are things that have a natural churn to them. Part of what makes fashion cool is its novelty. If something is not new and exciting, it really can't be fashionable. Pretty much by definition, anything your parents enjoy and/or are comfortable with is unfashionable.\nSo it makes perfect sense that Hippie fashions, whatever they ended up being, would be a reaction to 50's Eisenhower-era fashions. The best words there are \"drab\" and \"conservative\". We are talking very subdued colors, or pastels if you want to be racy. Short buzz-cuts for men, along with fairly well-fitted suits designed to not draw attention to the wearer. Long dresses and shortish hair on women. Popular music came from large band and orchestras.\nSo it makes perfect sense that their kids fashions would go against all of this. Bright colors. Long hair for everyone. Loose clothing for men, short skirts for women (or going the other way, clothing identical to men's). Music from small (5 or less member) bands.\nAnd being fashion, it went the same way it came. By the 80's, simple long hair and loose unisex clothing became something your parents were into, not something cool and cutting edge. Music built around simple arrangements (particularly the simplest - folk music) became boring stuff kids would never buy.\nCultural Attitudes - This is a bit more complex. Hippies tended to believe in racial and sexual equality more than their parents, but it could be argued this is just a part of a larger ongoing movement that started in the postwar era and continues today. There were some things that came and went though, particularly their accepting attitudes towards sexual promiscuity and illegal drug use.\nThe sexual revolution I would argue was actually started by two developments: The birth control pill and legalized abortion. These gave women the ability to have sexual relationships nearly as risk-free as men. It also allowed them to compete on the job market and in cultural society at large, without the likelihood of being taken out of the action in the middle of things by an unexpected pregnancy.\nThe general perception with drugs among hippies was that if you don't get caught by the authorities, then no harm done. So if it feels good, do it. Why not?\nWhat killed both of these attitudes in the 80's were the rise of really dangerous drugs and sexually transmitted diseases. Cocaine (and its little brother Crack) was the drug that turned \"drugs\" into scary things. Not only did they destroy a lot of lives (I know several cases personally), but they completely tore up the inner-cities.\nFor the diseases, we had Herpes and then AIDS. Herpes, had been around for centuries, but spread freely during the free love 70's (and got a nice hyping hand in the late 70's from a pharma company that had developed a treatment) It was pretty scary because its persistent and there's no cure for it. When AIDS came along it was far worse because not only did it not have a cure, but it didn't even have a treatment and it killed people. At first, a lot of people. This turned sex back into something you had to be careful about.\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Death of the Hippies - The Atlantic\") been living out in Berkeley, and he persuaded Joe to head back there with him. The drive took three or four days, almost all of it through dreary, frozen fields. They crashed on a floor somewhere in Ohio. In Wyoming, after they locked themselves out of their car, the local sheriff let them in, looked them over, and then told them never to come back to town. They crossed the Sierras during a blizzard, barely able to see the road. Eventually, they felt their car heading downhill instead of up.\n“And then,” says Joe, “all of a sudden, we found ourselves in this lush valley. It looked like a first-grade primer. The hills were rolling and green, all soft and curved like the beautiful body of a young woman. The sky was perfectly blue. And the clouds were all puffy, you know? Pure and white and glowing. I almost wondered, ‘Did we run off the road and fall into paradise?’”\nWhen they pulled into Berkeley, the hippies were everywhere—standing on every corner, lining every avenue. Joe had never seen anything like it. “People don’t really understand this now, but at that time, in most of the country, you couldn’t have long hair and not be in danger of being beaten up,” Joe explains. “In Boston, cars used to come screeching to a halt and guys would jump out and want to kill me. I’d have to run.” Even in New York, whenever he left Greenwich Village, “I was continually harassed, spit on, and shoved around.” And Joe wasn’t even really a hippie. “I was hip,” he says. “That meant boots, black jeans, a black t-shirt, a leather jacket—the kind of thing you’d maybe see the Rolling Stones wearing.”\nIn California, the flower-child style was at its apex. “People had really developed their individual looks,” he says. “They were no longer trying to figure out what being a hippie meant. I found that really stimulating. It made a great subject for a photographer—even though, by any middle-class standards, these people were living totally miserable lives.”\nJoe found a place to live and began spending his days out on the sidewalk. “I didn’t really own any clothes other than the ones I had on,” he says. “I hardly ever ate. Whenever I had money, my priorities were drugs, film, and food—in that order.”\nThere were two types of drug users on Telegraph Avenue. One group unapologetically shot heroin. The other group took mind-altering drugs but believed that opiates were a sinister way for The Man to keep poor people from climbing out of the ghetto. At first, some of the kids put up signs declaring, “No heroin dealers here.” Over time, Joe says, those signs came down and more and more people started using hard drugs. “All that stuff about consciousness was just sort of dropped.”\nLooking at Joe’s pictures, it’s clear how young some of those addicts were. One group of junior-high-aged girls, known as the Mini Mob, often showed up in Mickey Mouse t-shirts. “There were people there who had those young kids very much in their thrall,” says Joe. “They told them, ‘Listen, you don’t need to go to school. Everything you need to learn in life is right here on the street.’”\nA lot had changed in Berkeley since 1964, when thousands of students—many of them wearing suits and ties—gathered at Sproul Plaza to champion civil rights and demand free speech. Campuses had been the sources of the counterculture’s boldest ideas, the places where young activists mobilized to fight segregation and the Vietnam War, taking classes in political theory and Eastern philosophy.\nNow, college dropouts were congregating with misfits and runaways on the other side of Sather Gate. The outrage was still there, but the issues were murkier. While Joe was hanging out on Telegraph Avenue, his brother Paul published an anthology of underground newspaper diatribes called Fire! Among other things, the book ridiculed the whole idea of higher education:\nCollege is a fantasy in the suburban mind of Mr. and Mrs. Work-Hard-Our-Life-Is-No-Fun-But-the-Kid-Will-Get-What-We-Can’t-Afford. The campus is a cultured nes\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Death of the Hippies - The Atlantic\") ished an anthology of underground newspaper diatribes called Fire! Among other things, the book ridiculed the whole idea of higher education:\nCollege is a fantasy in the suburban mind of Mr. and Mrs. Work-Hard-Our-Life-Is-No-Fun-But-the-Kid-Will-Get-What-We-Can’t-Afford. The campus is a cultured nest egg where I-Don’t-Understand-He’s-Always-Been-a-Good-Boy and Oh-No-She’s-Not-That-Kind-of-Girl stroll hand in hand up the ladder to success, their tender heads floating in the lessons of the gentle professor. Only the kids never saw the professor. He was in his lab developing the new improved tear gas the kids are coughing under while the university president sits above it all.\nEven at the time, though, Joe says he was “too sarcastic” to fully buy into the radical agenda. “The average person on the avenue was almost completely ignorant politically,” Joe says. “All they really cared about was drugs, drugs, drugs. They were nihilists and hedonists. They just supported anything that was against the establishment. There was no intellectual foundation. The spirit everyone had talked about—the feeling of love and new age and progressive politics—was dying a miserable death.”\nJoe eventually got married, started a family, and settled into a middle-class existence, but he never moved away from Berkeley. There are still homeless people hanging out on Telegraph Avenue, but as Joe points out, they barely even pretend to be hippies anymore. The movement itself is dead, and so are many of the people who used to frequent the strip.\n“That was my problem with the whole thing,” says Joe. “There’s no growth for people if they’re continuously on drugs. It started out with all this higher thinking—expanding your mind to become more conscious of what’s really going on in the universe. But once the drugs took over, all of those big ideas disappeared.”\nThe author of the Atlantic article, Mark Harris, reached a similar conclusion. He was a generation older than the Baby Boomers, but as a white New Yorker who wrote for Ebony and The Negro Digest, he was highly sympathetic to the youth activism of the 1960s. He just didn’t think the hippies, in particular, were bringing about any meaningful change. Drugs had stunted their emotional development, leaving them at the mercy of “their illusions, their unreason, their devil theories, their inexperience of life, and their failures of perception.” Instead of promoting brotherhood and equality, they’d taken over public spaces, picked all the flowers in Golden Gate Park, and refused to turn their music down to let their hardworking neighbors sleep. And as they begged for money and frequented free clinics, these children of the suburbs siphoned resources away from the urban locals who needed them most.\nStill, the hippies did end up having a lasting impact on American culture—even if it wasn’t quite the one they’d intended. “After a while, I started to notice something,” Joe says. “All those people who used to want to beat the hell out of me because of my long hair—now their hair was long!” In the mid-1970s, when Lynyrd Skynyrd sang “Sweet Home Alabama” at the Oakland Coliseum against the backdrop of a giant Confederate flag, they looked oddly similar to the hippies of Telegraph Avenue. “So, yeah,” Joe concludes. “I guess there was a revolution.”\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems the hippie movement ended around 1970-1973. Several factors contributed to this:\n\n1. The Vietnam War was winding down, reducing a key rallying point for the movement.\n2. Many hippies experienced drug burnout and moved on to harder drugs, which can lead to a decline in creativity and ideals.\n3. As hippies aged, they began to move on to mainstream careers and family life, abandoning communal lifestyles.\n4. The rise of dangerous drugs like cocaine and AIDS caused a shift in attitudes toward drug use and sexuality.\n\nBased on these points, the hippie movement largely dissipated due to changing social dynamics, personal challenges, and the emergence of new societal pressures. \n\n<answer> 1970-1973 </answer>\n\nThe hippie movement largely ended in the period of 1970-1973 due to various factors including the winding down of the Vietnam War, drug burnout, and shifting societal pressures."

Inclusion, on the other hand, pertains to the strategies and procedures organizations implement to integrate everyone, ensuring their differences coexist beneficially.\nDiversity vs. inclusion. We sometimes confuse these terms and use them interchangeably. Below, we’ll provide their definitions and explain how they differ from each other, especially in the workplace.\nContents\nWhat is diversity?\nDiversity in the workplace describes the variation in personal, physical, and social characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, and education.\nWhat is inclusion?\nInclusion refers to the procedures organizations implement to integrate everyone in the workplace, allowing their differences to coexist in a mutually beneficial way. The goal of inclusion strategies is to make everyone feel accepted and comfortable, ready to share their opinions and thoughts without hesitation.\nIn other words, diversity indicates the “what” and inclusion the “how”.\nWhat is the main difference between diversity and inclusion?\nTo further clarify the distinction of diversity vs. inclusion, we can look at diversity as a globally accepted concept which brings different people into the same territory. Inclusion, on the other hand, introduces concrete methods and strategies to make diversity work.\nFor example, a recruiter who has overcome their unconscious biases will manage to hire diverse people and build a diverse team. If these team members feel valued, respected, and able to contribute equally to the team, then the company has succeeded in including them at a high level through its policies and culture.\nWorkforce diversity has been linked with many benefits, such as boosting creativity and enabling more effective problem solving. Hiring managers, though, tend to hire people with similar attributes to them, which leads to homogeneous teams and culture. This is mostly down to the fact that people are often attracted by similarities, which automatically creates a feeling of common understanding and belonging. But, having recognized diversity’s blessings, recruiters have started to combat bias and strive for heterogeneity when they hire people.\nOnce managers have achieved diversity in their team, the next step is to implement inclusion tactics. Team members need to feel psychologically safe and included to bring diversity’s benefits to light. Some of the common strategies companies adopt to enable this are implementing an EEO policy, conducting training sessions in inclusive leadership or intercultural communication and recruiting diversity and inclusion managers.\nTo sum up, diversity and inclusion are complementary and depend on each other. Inclusion is the conscious effort organizations exert to support diversity and pull it beyond simple hype.\nWant more definitions? See our complete library of HR Terms.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Diversity vs Inclusion: What’s the difference? | AIHR\") Diversity and inclusion (D&I) are often used in tandem rather than as diversity vs inclusion. While this is understandable, and while one certainly is necessary in order to achieve the other, they’re two different concepts. In this article, we’ll look at diversity vs inclusion, the difference between the two, how D&I leads to organizational success and 7 examples of diversity and inclusion activities in the workplace. Here goes!\nContents\nWhat’s the difference between diversity and inclusion?\nHow D&I leads to organizational success\n7 Examples of diversity and inclusion activities\nOn a final note\nFAQ\nand how D&I can lead to organizational success.\nDiversity vs Inclusion: What’s the difference?\nIf we want to understand the difference between diversity and inclusion, we need to define both terms first.\nDiversity in the workplace refers to a workforce that’s made up of people from, among other things, different ages, cultural backgrounds, geographies, physical abilities and disabilities, religions, genders, and sexual orientation.\nTrue workforce diversity, however, goes beyond these (social) categories. It includes all the elements that make individual employees unique from one another; their perspectives, preferences, characteristics, even their biases.\nAccording to SHRM, inclusion can be defined as the achievement of a work environment in which all individuals are treated fairly and respectfully, have equal access to opportunities and resources, and contribute fully to the organization’s success.\nSo then, when we talk about diversity vs. inclusion, what’s the difference? Put simply, diversity is about the what – it focuses on the makeup of your workforce.\nInclusion, on the other hand, is about the how – the creation of a work environment and culture that enables all employees to participate and thrive.\nHow inclusion and diversity lead to organizational success\nSeparate concepts or not, diversity and inclusion do go hand in hand. After all, you can increase your diversity hiring efforts in order to reach your workforce diversity goals all you like, if you don’t have a culture that ensures everyone feels welcome, you might as well save yourself the trouble.\nLet’s take a look at the various ways in which inclusion and diversity lead to organizational success.\nBetter financial returns\nAccording to a 2015 McKinsey report called Diversity Matters, companies in the top quartile for both racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to have financial returns that exceed their national industry medians. For companies in the top quartile for gender diversity this is 15%.\nD&I drives innovation\nVarious research studies show that there is a relationship between diversity and innovation. A diverse set of experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds is essential for innovation and the development of new ideas.\nA study by Harvard Business Review found that companies with an above-average total diversity (meaning migration, industry, career path, gender, education and age diversity), had 19% higher innovation revenues and 9% higher EBIT margins.\nIn its 2018 report, The Diversity and Inclusion Revolution, Deloitte found that organizations with inclusive cultures were, among other things, six times more likely to be innovative and agile: they see more angles on potential problems, imagine smarter and multi-faceted solutions and spot the biases in what they’re creating.\nIn an inclusive workplace, all employees can find senior people in the organization who will endorse their ideas and convince those in charge of budgets to use resources in order to develop those ideas. In non (or less) inclusive organizations, this is a lot harder for minorities such as women, people of color and LGBTs – which means that those organizations lose out on a lot of potentially great innovative ideas and market opportunities.\nAttracting and retaining talent\nOrganizations that embrace diversity hiring benefit from a larger talent pool than those who don’t. Their vacancies\nDoc 3(Title: \"The Differences Between Diversity And Inclusion In The ...\") e employees and the business. Developing more diversity and building more inclusion for the workforce can help the business achieve its profitability, scalability, and innovation goals. It allows the workforce to benefit from the unique attributes of each employee and gives the organization access to more resources.\nIf a business has a diverse workforce and managers are aware of the unique abilities of each team member, they can get a lot more done with the human resource they have. On the other hand, suppose the workers also feel included and are inclined to cooperate with the business in things beyond their job description. In that case, it can be beneficial for both the employee and the business. Rather than hiring externally, the business can make the most of the people they already have. Still, it generally directly relates while employees will feel more engaged and will enjoy being part of a team.\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Differences Between Diversity And Inclusion In The ...\") The modern business environment allows even small businesses to function at a global level. More than just being able to sell products and services to a global audience, it’s also about the people that make up the business and the stakeholders the business entertains. As we live in a multicultural and diverse population, we are working full of people from all religions, races, languages, and genders. Moreover, today business owners and customers are in the market for high-quality services and products. The focus for businesses is on getting the best people they can for the job, regardless of age, religion, sexual orientation, and race. On the other hand, customers are looking to purchase goods and services of the highest quality at the lowest possible rate. Moreover, customers are also a lot more concerned today about how environmentally friendly a business is, how balanced its workforce is, and how well it treats its employees. Investing in a diverse workforce and creating an inclusive environment can have a range of benefits for a business beyond just profitability.\nDiversity\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but their implications are very different.\nDiversity refers to variations in the workforce, referring to gender, religion, race, and sexual orientation. However, more than just physical attributes, cognitive and behavioral traits are also part of a diverse workforce and are used as differentiating factors among team members. Things such as the personal life experiences of employees go a long way in influencing how they see things, how they solve problems, and how they perform as part of the business.\nHowever, this is not to say that diversity is equal across all industries and roles. While there has been a shift towards a more global workforce, there are still several areas that are dominated by a specific gender or a certain kind of employee.\nThe Workforce Today\nUnless the role requires a particular person, anyone and everyone with the right skill set can apply for the position. For this reason, we have a workforce today that is far more diverse than what it used to be just a few short decades ago. There are many benefits to these modern work teams, but they also come with their own challenges. With the workforce across the world getting more intertwined through things such as remote working and freelancing, we are seeing a more diverse range of teams coming together all over the world.\nInclusion\nThis refers to the extent to which the work, presence, input, and opinions of various employees influence and affect the output of the business. Since inclusion is a relatively subjective term, it can be hard to quantify and evaluate, but generally, people who feel more included in their teams also feel like their work has a direct relation to the business they are working in and feel that their efforts are directly impacting the business.\nThe level of inclusion that a business generates for its team members affects the business and has a significant impact on employee behavior. While inclusive can be a very physical process, the softer, intangible traits of inclusion influence how employees feel about their work and the employer they work for. This is very prominent in high-risk teams such as teams in the army that work together in war, medical teams that work in emergency situations, and highly technical fields of work where teams rely on individual competencies to get a job done.\nAre Diversity And Inclusion Necessary\nSome may argue that these concepts are irrelevant and managers should be more goal-oriented. However, it can’t be denied that studies have shown that higher levels of inclusion and diversity benefit both the employees and the business. Developing more diversity and building more inclusion for the workforce can help the business achieve its profitability, scalability, and innovation goals. It allows the workforce to benefit from the unique attributes of each employee and gives the organization access t\nDoc 5(Title: \"Diversity vs Inclusion: What’s the difference? | AIHR\") omen, people of color and LGBTs – which means that those organizations lose out on a lot of potentially great innovative ideas and market opportunities.\nAttracting and retaining talent\nOrganizations that embrace diversity hiring benefit from a larger talent pool than those who don’t. Their vacancies will gain interest from a wider range of candidates because more people with different backgrounds can relate to the organization.\nThe same thing goes for retaining talent. Employees who feel that they are accepted and appreciated for who they are – no matter what their gender, age, perspectives or sexual orientation, are happier and thus less likely to leave.\nAlong the same lines, companies that focus on D&I initiatives to make employees feel more welcome tend to have a workforce that is more satisfied too.\nBetter performance and greater productivity\nAccording to an executive briefing by the Society for Human Resources, research shows that generational diversity can improve organizational performance. It also shows that HR practices that improve the age diversity climate in a company can potentially further improve that performance.\nAccording to the same briefing, both older and younger workers are more productive in companies with mixed-age work teams.\n7 Examples of diversity and inclusion activities in the workplace\nAlright, we’ve identified what the difference is between diversity and inclusion and how D&I lead to organizational success. Let’s now have a look at 7 examples of easy to implement diversity and inclusion activities that celebrate employee differences.\nEach of these activities shows that when it comes to diversity vs inclusion, the latter is necessary to make the former work.\n1. The Respect Discussion\nA simple yet important one to start with. The idea is for employees to walk up to one of their colleagues, preferably someone they don’t usually interact with, and introduce themselves. Once the introductions are made, they talk about what respect means to them, how they define it and give examples of how this can be demonstrated in the workplace.\nOnce this conversation is finished, the group gets back together and the various examples of respect are shared with the entire group and discussed. The goal of this exercise is twofold: to contemplate about the concept of respect from different points of view and to think about how others might view a person’s actions through the prism of their own, unique experiences.\nThe Respect Discussion is a fantastic way to make your employees really think about the manner in which they interact with each other.\n2. Food\nWhat better way to unite people and celebrate diversity than with food, right? Organize a breakfast, pick-nick, lunch, 4 o’clock snack or what have you where employees bring in (homemade) dishes from or inspired by their culture and heritage.\nNot only does this kind of activity offer a great opportunity to taste all kinds of delicious food, but it also gives employees a chance to share and connect on a different level.\n3. Money in the jar\nIf you’re familiar with the concept of a swear jar you’ll know what’s next. The money in the jar idea can take various shapes. It can be used to encourage a gender-neutral language for better diversity and inclusion in the workplace for example.\nA word like ‘guys’, for instance, can make female employees feel excluded and, by extension, unhappy. By making everyone who uses the word guys in a wrong context put a Dollar (or any other kind of amount and/or currency) in the jar, this increases people’s awareness against using gendered words at work.\n4. The Paper Basket Exercise\nRather than giving you a lengthy explanation of this game I suggest you watch the below video.\nThe overall idea of this exercise is to show how privilege works and how a team of individual contributors can still support and help each other if they want to; it shows that inclusive actions can help a team to do more.\n5.

The media's role in society may shape an individual's beliefs about themselves and others, as well as the expectations they see portrayed, leading to negative effects on both men and boys and their female counterparts.\nThese stereotypes may affect how gender is treated in societal environments such as the workplace, legal settings, and mental health systems, perpetuating gender stereotypes in the media and hindering progress toward gender parity. Raising awareness of these issues among media professionals and promoting gender sensitivity can help create a more balanced representation of every age group and challenge traditional gender norms.\nYoung people from childhood to adolescence may be significantly impacted by gender stereotypes online or in media. Other stereotypes or societal norms, like high school stereotypes, may also exist in the media.\nThese messages may create mental health issues among the younger generations, fueling concerns about body image, loneliness, eating disorders, depression, and violence against all genders.\nThe media can play a significant role in the perpetuation of gender stereotypes through the following platforms:\n- Advertising\n- Television programs\n- News programs\n- Music videos\n- Commercials\n- Video games\n- Social media\n- Newspapers and magazines\nThe media, through its pervasive news coverage and popular media platforms, can bombard people with gender issues and stereotyping that often become deeply ingrained in society and day-to-day lives. For example, a fashion trend marketed on social media towards a female audience may be frowned upon if adopted by their male counterparts. Media professionals play a crucial role in challenging these negative values by promoting more positive effects.\nMental health stigmas related to gender\nMental health stigmas refer to negative beliefs or attitudes toward an individual or group experiencing mental health concerns. The news media, including news coverage and news stories, families, and social circles may perpetuate many stigmas associated with gender, sexual orientation, and mental illness within society.\nFor example, people, especially older women, may be embarrassed to seek therapy due to media communication drawing a tie between treatment and weakness or social embarrassment. These beliefs could prevent a vast majority of people from seeking care that would benefit them and offer relief from symptoms.\nMental health among men and trans-masculine genders\nMen, women, and other genders may all be affected by mental health conditions and concerns. However, these concerns may go untreated in men. Studies show that men or those assigned males at birth may be less likely to seek treatment than those assigned females at birth due to stigmas and stereotypes about masculinity or gender.\nCertain friend groups, leaders, or environments may enforce ideas that masculinity is associated with strength and dominance, making it more difficult for some people to express their emotions and ultimately seek help.\nThese societal trends may pressure masculine people to provide, \"just get over\" traumatic events, defend themselves physically, or treat women as objects.\nMany boys and men feel pushed or persuaded into these behaviors, even if they are uncomfortable with them. Even if it does not bring them mental wellness and fulfillment in the long run, they may keep quiet out of fear of social persecution.\nThese types of toxic enviro\nDoc 2(Title: \"Gender-based Stereotypes Effects On Women\") Table of Contents\nIntroduction\nA stereotype is a broadly accepted bias or judgment about a group or a person. Gender-based stereotypes can cause inadequate and unfair treatment because of a person’s gender. A gender stereotype is a presumption about characteristics, or you can say the roles that must be influenced or accomplished by both male and the female. If the gender stereotype is of the level that it affects men’s and women’s ability to pursue their professions, to develop their personal abilities and even to make their life decisions, then it is very harmful and can have negative consequences.\nHow do gender stereotypes originate?\nGender stereotypes instigate from local culture and societies. Family, friends, media, and institutions such as religious groups and schools are responsible to make the children learn that what creates male and female behavior. Young people are most of the time exposed to thoughts about how they should behave, look and play. These unconsciously accepted social ideas start to form at a very young age. Overall, it adversely affects all genders.\nKinds of gender-based stereotypes\nGender-based stereotypes are of four kinds discussed below:-\nBehavioral traits – Men are expected to be aggressive and self-confident while women, on the other hand, are usually expected to be emotional as well as obliging.\nProfessions and occupations – It is expected that women should mostly become teachers and nurses while it is considered as a norm that professions such as pilots, doctors, and engineers belong to men. For example “only 7% of engineering modern apprenticeships in the UK were filled by girls in 2016” According to E Jones and F Aldridge’s Understanding the underrepresentation of women in engineering apprenticeships. According to the Summary Statistics for Schools in Scotland, No. 8: 2017 Edition. Gov.scot, It was stated that only 10% of primary level teachers in schools (Scotland) are men. Therefore, this seems to be the practical proof of what the socio-cultural aspect is related to women.\nDomestic comportments – Women are mostly expected to cook, clean and take care of the children, on the contrary, it is expected from men to take care of the money and home maintenances. The study, presented in J Olchawski. Parents, Work And Care: Striking the Balance. London: Fawcett Society; 2016:4, mentioned that that “38% of dads lie to their boss to take time off work to spend with their children”.\nPhysical appearance – To look thin and beautiful is expected from the women while men are expected to be tall and well built. Likewise applies to dress, makeup and hairstyles of both genders. It is proved by Girl Guiding UK. Girls’ Attitudes Survey 2014. London: Girl guiding; 2014:13 that “87% of women asked (aged 11–21) think that women are judged more for their looks than ability”.\nHow do gender stereotypes affect women?\nUnfair gender stereotyping is a common cause of women’s discrimination. Rights that are violated due to such discrimination are the living standard, the right to health, right to get an education, marriage and onwards family relations, freedom to express oneself, freedom of movement or to go outside or drive, Yes even driving the car is considered as the stereotype that women can’t drive like men. Similarly, women have to face discrimination in work, and they cannot have the liberty from gender-based violence, etc. Further wrongful gender stereotypes have set a lot more examples.\nMen consider women as sexual property and it is very difficult to declare forced sex after marriage as marital rape and the failure to efficiently investigate, impeach and sentence sexual violence against women for supposing the stereotype that women should dress modestly to protect themselves from sexual violence. Gender stereotypes along with other stereotypes have a lop-sided negative impression on certain women groups, like aboriginal groups, women from minority or disabled women or women with lower economic status, etc. It\nDoc 3(Title: \"How Gender Stereotypes In The Media Harm Society | Betterhelp\") ly, or treat women as objects.\nMany boys and men feel pushed or persuaded into these behaviors, even if they are uncomfortable with them. Even if it does not bring them mental wellness and fulfillment in the long run, they may keep quiet out of fear of social persecution.\nThese types of toxic environments and pressures can lead to many concerns with mental health, including:\n- An increase in symptoms of depression or anxiety\n- An increase in substance use\n- Greater physical health risks\n- Relationship or interpersonal challenges\n- Violence\n- Homophobia\n- Discouragement over seeking help\nRegardless of what you were taught, you don't need to carry any mental health burden alone. With the help of certified professionals or loved ones and through opening up about what ails you, you may find strength in vulnerability and learn from your challenges. Reaching out for help can be brave.\nMental health among women and trans-feminine genders\nGender roles in the media may cause mental health concerns among women and those who identify with a trans-feminine gender. These concerns may include but are not limited to the following:\n- Depression\n- Anxiety\n- Body-image issues\n- Low self-confidence\n- Self-esteem issues\n- Fear of being harmed\n- Eating disorders\n- Body dysmorphia\nWomen may be portrayed as dependent and submissive and are often sexualized within the media. Research shows that women are more likely to experience depression or anxiety due to harmful body image and sexualization stereotypes and may be more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), often related to sexual abuse.\nA recent study found that young children at the age of six associated being \"smart\" with masculinity and not femininity. Researchers completed this study by telling a gender-neutral story about an intelligent person, and when asked to identify the person from the story, the majority chose male characters.\nThe study also found that belief in this stereotype may impact girls' activities and choices from the time they first enter school. For example, it has been established that women do not tend to go into fields of science and technology with the same frequency as male peers. This study suggests that these beliefs are shaped beginning in early childhood.\nThe media reinforces these stereotypes, sometimes unintentionally. For example, if most protagonists are male or masculine, it may put women in the role of supportive side-character or love interest and may breeze over feminine people's complexity.\nIf a female character is not portrayed as intelligent, flawed, analytical, brave, or strong but are portrayed as primarily sexy or one-dimensional, it can reinforce the stereotype that women are not complex human beings with their own desires, hopes, experiences, and thoughts.\nWhen repeated enough times, these stereotypes may perpetuate the belief to young children and young adults that women are not as wise as men. Therefore, they may not perceive themselves as capable of certain activities or educational opportunities, resulting in fewer women in specific career fields. Stereotypes may not only discourage women and trans-feminine people from applying to these types of careers. They may also be perpetuated by the individuals working in the fields. For example, a job that primarily hires men may not offer maternity leave or view women as valuable assets to the company.\nMental health among non-binary and gender-diverse individuals\nAlthough many individuals may be subjected to stereotypes based on their assigned gender at birth, non-binary or gender-diverse individuals who do not identify with any of the above gender labels may experience varying stereotypes or hurdles in various areas of life.\nIn many individuals who are non-binary or transgender, gender dysphoria can be a concern. Studies show that those who experience gender dysphoria are more likely to have attachment disorders or experience trauma.\nMedia may not cover the experience of gender dysp\nDoc 4(Title: \"How Gender Stereotypes In The Media Harm Society | Betterhelp\") e care and childcare. Many women have long-term careers, and many men hope to be homemakers or are not open to providing all finances in a relationship. In addition, these stereotypes are often heteronormative, expecting all men to want to be with women. In reality, many men date men, and women date women.\nWhat are examples of gender stereotypes in education?\nIn education, gender stereotypes are often present that share the idea that teachers are usually women or that teaching is a “feminine” job. Male teachers are often expected to teach subjects considered more masculine, such as science and mathematics. These stereotypes can lead to harmful impacts on entire communities and society as a whole, discouraging men from applying to be teachers, which is a career that always needs more attention and support.\n- Previous Article\n- Next Article\nDoc 5(Title: \"How Gender Stereotypes In The Media Harm Society | Betterhelp\") ce negative stereotypes, break down the idea of a rigid gender binary, and encourage inclusivity. Make the change if someone asks you to use \"they/them\" pronouns when referring to them.\nUsing job titles like fireman or policeman may insinuate that those jobs should only be for those of the male gender. Instead, referring to these individuals as firefighters or police officers may be more inclusive.\nYou might also be urged to refer to those in the military as \"military men\" or \"servicemen.\" However, you can use gender-neutral language by calling them \"service people.\"\nHow to get help when impacted by gender stereotypes\nAny gender can experience harmful stereotypes about their gender. Whether in the workplace, schools, relationships, or the criminal justice system, fighting against gender stereotypes may be emotionally trying and stressful. If you are facing challenges or mental health concerns due to gender stereotypes, a licensed therapist may be able to help. A counselor may assist you in identifying the gender stereotypes that are affecting you and help you overcome them. They may also help you make peace with things that have happened to you due to stereotyping and help you develop solutions for coping and overcoming the stigmas related to these gender binaries.\nYou might try online therapy if you're uncomfortable meeting with a therapist in person due to concerns about gender presentation or safety. Online therapy is often more affordable than traditional counseling, as well. Clinical studies have proven that online treatment is effective in reducing the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Other studies have shown that online therapy is often more effective than traditional in-person counseling.\nIf you're looking for support, you may consider an online therapy platform such as BetterHelp for individuals or Regain for couples. Online platforms may match you with a licensed therapist to best suit your needs related to gender stereotypes or other mental health concerns.\nTakeaway\nGender stereotypes may negatively impact people of all genders. Often, stereotypes in media portrayals can reduce people to categories instead of regarding them as complex human beings. By ignoring the infinitely complex nature of individuals, the media may encourage them to behave in ways that can make them uncomfortable and unhappy.\nMany individuals feel lonely, lost, or confused about how to behave or feel. While gender stereotypes may offer a temporary answer, who you are may be much more complex. For example, World War II broke some gender norms as women took on roles traditionally held by men.\nYou may break free from harmful expectations and stereotypes with gentle care, education, and understanding. Consider reaching out to a counselor if you're ready to take the first step.\nWhat role does the media play in gender stereotyping?\nThe media can encourage gender stereotyping by spreading stereotypes to large audiences and normalizing certain jokes that might be offensive and harmful in real life. In addition, the media showcases celebrities and people that society looks up to partaking in these messages, which can further cement the idea that it’s “okay” to spread unfair messages about certain groups. Often, these portrayals can be difficult to spot and aren’t presented as explicit jokes or statements. For example, fantasy movies that put female characters in armor outfits that show their skin but don’t protect them are spreading harmful messages about women as “sexual objects” instead of humans.\nWhat is an example of gender stereotyping?\nAn example of gender stereotyping is expecting a man to provide financially while a woman works at home, offering home care and childcare. Many women have long-term careers, and many men hope to be homemakers or are not open to providing all finances in a relationship. In addition, these stereotypes are often heteronormative, expecting all men to want to be with women. In reality, many men date men, and women date\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that gender stereotypes harm women in several ways:\n\n1. **Career Choices**: Women are often steered towards traditionally \"female\" professions like teaching and nursing, while men are encouraged to pursue STEM fields.\n2. **Domestic Roles**: Women are frequently expected to handle domestic tasks like cooking and childcare, while men are seen as breadwinners.\n3. **Sexualization**: Women are often objectified and expected to conform to unrealistic beauty standards.\n4. **Mental Health**: These stereotypes contribute to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and body image issues among women.\n\nBased on this, gender stereotypes harm women by limiting their professional opportunities, reinforcing unfair domestic roles, and perpetuating harmful beauty ideals.

Adam Wright’s post provides additional client acquisition strategies.\nPricing Your Services as an Artist\nPricing requires adjustments to find what works, with artists benefiting from competitor price visibility. Yet, art pricing is complex, influenced by the artist’s perceived value and timing.\nTo succeed financially, artists must stand out with unique or exceptional work, keeping up with trends without being dominated by them. A strong, distinct style developed through constant skill improvement is essential.\nPersistence and resilience are key, as the art world often involves criticism. A thick skin helps in distinguishing helpful feedback from negativity. Art’s subjective nature means finding the right audience is crucial, with a willingness to adapt if necessary.\nDiscipline and financial prudence are important for managing a creative business, especially initially. Branding and presentation enhance first impressions, with platforms like Behance and DeviantArt useful for showcasing work.

Then, when I ask them to engage through the roles that they play in their professional life, they are willing to engage in another school.\nHow we choose or select our own identity influences what we’re willing to engage with and how we engage. We really need to be cognizant of how we’re asking people to engage and through which lenses they are seeing the world, both in the current system and what the system could look like in the future.\nI think that’s particularly relevant with parents because they grew up in the same system. There’s no reason why they should suddenly be able to reimagine the system today. We have to do it as a collective effort and a collective narrative.

The hearing world consists of those that can, well obviously, hear. Those within the hearing world can hear naturally or with the aid of a hearing device. The deaf world includes those that cannot hear. Also, included in the deaf world is deaf culture. Deaf culture is almost exactly what it sounds like; a common heritage shared between the deaf community. Traditions, beliefs, history and values are included in deaf culture. Being deaf myself, I'd love to be more informative from my own perspective; however, I experience both worlds every day, but I have never experienced deaf culture.\nI was four when my parents noticed that something was off with my hearing. It was not until I was 7 years old that I received my first pair of hearing aids. Before hearing aids, everything was muffled like you are talking underwater or listening with headphones in your ears. With hearing aids, everything was just so much louder, but still muffled. I did not like wearing them at all, but I wanted to hear. By the time I was 12 years old, I learned that my hearing was getting worse as I was growing older. It never really upset me; it was just kind of annoying. I was 16 years old when I received my cochlear implant. And for those that are not aware of what a cochlear implant is, a cochlear implant is an surgically implanted electronic device that replaces the function of the damaged inner ear, or the cochlea. Hearing with the aid of a cochlear implant was so much better; every sound was clear and I heard sounds I have never heard before.\nAs I said before, I experience both worlds every day. I do not partake in deaf culture, and I do not understand it at all. While I do not agree with those that support deaf culture, I respect the idea completely. One of the main reasons I do not support deaf culture is because I have been somewhat shunned from it. Numerous times I have been told by those that are deaf that I should have not gotten a cochlear implant or hearing aids. They said I need to embrace my deafness; that my hearing loss should be my identity. In deaf culture, many believe that the loss of their hearing sense is a cultural identity instead of a medical condition that needs to be fixed.\nI consider it a medical condition. I would love to have my hearing loss miraculously cured. I would love to not worry about my cochlear needing to be charged when I go out. I would love to not get anxious about social situations. I would also absolutely love to not hear \"Oh, I'm sorry\" when I inform people that I can't hear them sometimes in a conversation. As I said before, being deaf has not been a burden on my life. I'm not proud of it as other deaf people are, and I wish it could be fixed.\nThe disability separates me from both the hearing world and the deaf world. But why should a disability separate people so much? Everyone is human despite our differences and disabilities that should be accepted in today's society. Why are we letting something this small stop from bringing people together? Being at a school without a deaf population has been the best thing for me because it gave me the opportunity to be accepted as a normal individual. If everyone could look past the ability to hear or not hear then I believe that the two worlds will become more united together.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Food: Bringing Friends Family and Cultures Together - A ...\") Food: Bringing Friends, Family and Cultures Together\nSarah Basile\n| 3 min read\nThere are a few tangible items that all humans need: air, water, shelter and food. Eating is essential for most forms of life, and experimenting with different spices, ingredients and recipes is a common way to socialize.\nThink about it – most holidays or family gatherings include a meal that is served every year. Food is tied to tradition; food is tied to memories, and many people don’t realize the importance of food as a way to bring people together.\nIn fact, food is so ingrained in our social landscape that it’s hard to imagine any kind of gathering without it. From holidays to a summer barbecue to meeting friends for lunch, to family dinners, food is almost always involved, often serving as the main attraction. Even holidays and key family traditions can center around certain meals and foods. Thanksgiving wouldn’t be the same without turkey, just as Christmas wouldn’t be the same without ham for many families.\nResearchers from the University of Oxford recently found a correlation between how often people eat with others and their life satisfaction. Their results suggest that the more often one eats with others, the more likely they are to feel satisfied and happy with their lives. Socializing is important for one’s physical and mental wellbeing, and social eating plays an important role in bonding with others.\nSocializing with food involved has more pros than cons, including:\n- Instilling a sense of comfort\n- Helping us get out of our comfort zone and trying new things\n- Encouraging a sense of belonging because of common food interests\n- Allowing us to be present and engaged while eating\n- Providing a bonding experience\n- Improving emotional wellbeing\nFood brings people from different cultures together, too. It’s a fantastic vehicle for learning about people with different backgrounds. Food is part of your family history and who you are, so get to know your close friends and relatives better by hosting a dinner party and having everyone bring a dish that is representative of their heritage.\nEmbrace the social aspect of food by trying out some of these fun ideas:\n- Eat as a family\n- Host a dinner party\n- Share dishes around the table\n- Set a weekly dinner for everyone to attend\n- Bring food in for the office\n- Take a cooking class\nEmbrace food. It’s delicious, we need it, and eating with others can create memories that last a lifetime. Food has the potential to become a part of who you are.

Culture is a broad term that is used to refer to the set customs and values that a group of people have to abide by. It is these attitudes that shape the behavior modes of the people in the different culture creating rules and ways of conduct in sexual relationships and sexual behavior. There is huge interplay between the sexuality and the cultural believes that hold a set of people together. It is not possible to separate these two variables based on the fact that the cultural norms have bred a new behavior in the group of people. The nature of the cultures also affects the sexual contacts that are established in the cultures. It is imperative to note that collectivist cultures are bond to have more strict rules on sexual relations in contrast to the individualist society (Agner, 1999).\nDifferences of the Sexual Attitudes and Behavior of Two Cultures:\nThe selected cultures in this case scenario are the; American and African cultures. There are diverse characteristics that mark the two cultures. The American culture which is an individualist culture does not embrace the value of close social relations. This is what makes the culture not to hold strong stringent measures on sexual behavior.

Then, when I ask them to engage through the roles that they play in their professional life, they are willing to engage in another school.\nHow we choose or select our own identity influences what we’re willing to engage with and how we engage. We really need to be cognizant of how we’re asking people to engage and through which lenses they are seeing the world, both in the current system and what the system could look like in the future.\nI think that’s particularly relevant with parents because they grew up in the same system. There’s no reason why they should suddenly be able to reimagine the system today. We have to do it as a collective effort and a collective narrative. I recognize that’s not a concrete idea, but I think we make assumptions that people are going to imagine something different from what they experienced.\nIt’s why I work with artists so much.

Culture is a broad term that is used to refer to the set customs and values that a group of people have to abide by. It is these attitudes that shape the behavior modes of the people in the different culture creating rules and ways of conduct in sexual relationships and sexual behavior. There is huge interplay between the sexuality and the cultural believes that hold a set of people together. It is not possible to separate these two variables based on the fact that the cultural norms have bred a new behavior in the group of people. The nature of the cultures also affects the sexual contacts that are established in the cultures. It is imperative to note that collectivist cultures are bond to have more strict rules on sexual relations in contrast to the individualist society (Agner, 1999).\nDifferences of the Sexual Attitudes and Behavior of Two Cultures:\nThe selected cultures in this case scenario are the; American and African cultures. There are diverse characteristics that mark the two cultures. The American culture which is an individualist culture does not embrace the value of close social relations. This is what makes the culture not to hold strong stringent measures on sexual behavior.

Then, when I ask them to engage through the roles that they play in their professional life, they are willing to engage in another school.\nHow we choose or select our own identity influences what we’re willing to engage with and how we engage. We really need to be cognizant of how we’re asking people to engage and through which lenses they are seeing the world, both in the current system and what the system could look like in the future.\nI think that’s particularly relevant with parents because they grew up in the same system. There’s no reason why they should suddenly be able to reimagine the system today. We have to do it as a collective effort and a collective narrative. I recognize that’s not a concrete idea, but I think we make assumptions that people are going to imagine something different from what they experienced.\nIt’s why I work with artists so much. They get us out of our boxes and open us up to permeate the disciplines and other ways of creative thinking that our experience in the education system can sometimes limit us from accessing.\nQ. What would you tell people who are doing the work of leveraging community assets from a learner-centered perspective?\nTimothy Jones: Don’t worry about the pace of the change at the onset. You never get to fully understand the impact when you first start out. As much as you can, document and allow recipients of services to tell their story. There’s so much going on that it can almost paralyze you and make you feel powerless. But, you’ll see more possibilities if you change that perspective to, “There’s so much going on, that, if I just try my best, I’m going to find a way to make an impact.”\nJosh Schachter: In our culture and society, we talk about innovation a lot. Everyone wants to be an innovator and, as someone that was an educator, that’s now running a tech-focused nonprofit, I’ve come to realize that most innovation involves failure, humility, and iteration.\nWe have to embrace it. If we’re not willing to be learners in this process, listen to what we’ve learned, and adapt, then we’re not going to be able to get out of the current situation. We’re not going to get it right the first or second time, but maybe that’s the point. Isn’t that the point of learning?\nIt’s the journey of learning that creates the desire to learn. I think we need to have the humility to remember that is going to be central to whatever we’re going to create, and resist the pressure of funders and others who want us to present the outcomes and the outputs before we even start the process. That type of thinking probably isn’t going to get us where we need to go because we may not know exactly where we’re headed.\nI think there are bright spots that we can learn from, and we need to highlight those bright spots and share the lessons learned across our networks.\nJoe Hobot: I’m drawing from my experience as an Indigenous man within an Indigenous community, who’s had its youth be forced under subjugated protocols of a dominant culture until we reached an existential crisis with our language, our customs, and the corrosive effect education is having.\nMy advice, and what I’ve learned, is to be bold. The best examples of educational practices that have been working; they just dreamed it up and did it. After about two decades of protracted investigation and research into public education reform, and the academic achievements of the various communities of color within this country, we’ve come to understand that we’re in this “emperor has no clothes” moment.\nIt’s time to shed that fear that you’re going to need to have official approval of the systems in place and just do it. Dream it up and do it. Take care of your youth, educate them, and particularly in a culturally contextualized way that lifts them up and hardens them as valued individuals.

According to a recent survey, 98% of business leaders said technology played a crucial role in navigating the pandemic.\nIn 2020, the volume of new Irish websites increased immensely to accommodate many consumers who moved their transactions online due to Covid-19 restrictions. In 2021, online trading for businesses has become the new norm, creating greater brand awareness competition in many Irish sectors. There has never been a better time to start considering digital marketing to grow your business.\nContact our team for a free consultation\nWhy Should You Use Digital Marketing?\nThere are various reasons for your business to use digital marketing. These include:\n- Learning more about your audience and how to reach them.\n- Controlling the budget with results in numbers.\n- Reaching a larger audience with a broader reach.\n- Faster results.\n- Most likely, all of your competitors have digital marketing practices in place.\nHow Does Digital Marketing Work?\nIn 2021, most people spend a great deal of their time online – almost two billion people worldwide are online at any given time, most likely on social media and Google platforms in this part of the world. In the digital buyer’s journey, a customer must first become aware of your brand, consider their options, and finally, decide to purchase. One of the first steps towards doing this correctly is by creating an integrated digital strategy.\nYour digital strategy must include a comprehensive approach for your marketing to give you an effective return on investment (ROI). This will mean leveraging multiple digital marketing services to effectively carry out market research, create a plan of action, decide what tools and platforms to use that suit your needs, and successfully measure the progress of your campaigns.\nWithout Google Analytics, for example, your digital marketing efforts have no precise measure of ROI or success. Without a clean, fast, mobile-friendly website, visitors will not engage and convert to the full potential. Without constant campaign tweaks, adjustments and testing, you would waste your budget while missing opportunities for revenue.\nWithout experts who are dedicated to your marketing strategy, you are not likely to reap the rewards you want. If you outsource digital marketing services, from Grofuse for example, the digital marketing experts will be accountable for the implementation and measurement of the strategy regularly.\n5 Ways Digital Marketing Helps To Grow Your Business:\n1.

    "agent_answer": "Assistant: Based on available insights, Mondrian viewed Cubism and De Stijl as distinct yet complementary artistic expressions. Cubism, characterized by the fragmentation and reconstruction of forms into abstract planes and facets, contrasted with De Stijl’s emphasis on purity and harmony through primary colors and geometric abstraction.

Classically trained in the European school, Picasso emerged as a symbolist, drawing on Impressionism through Munch and Post-Impressionism via Lautrec. From Cézanne and Rousseau, he learned about archaic and tribal art, which led him toward Cubism.\nPicasso strove to define his place in the history of painting from the outset of his long career. Art historians consider his late works direct dialogues with Old Masters such as Velazquez, Goya and Rembrandt. He lived most of his life in France, so Picasso knew the latest trends and schools of art. Accordingly, he studied Symbolism, which worked to build a visual language of the soul from imagery drawn from mythology and dreams. Picasso also drew on Impressionist Munch to explore the nature of souls. Clearly Lautrec influenced his palette and his choice of subjects – prostitutes and the poor – during his Blue period, so-called because of his blue and gray palette. In fact, much of Picasso’s early work experiments with color – beginning in 1897 in violet and green through the Blue and consequent Rose period and his orange and red palette. This led him to experiment with shape as well, following Cezanne – Post-Impressionism influenced by primitive art – and Rousseau – experiments in Naïve art. Picasso began to use more angular shapes and figures, as well as more color, as he worked toward founding cubism with Braque, where the artist analyzes a subject or shape, disassembles it, then reassembles it in an abstracted form. Working in cubism led Picasso to invent collage and work toward a second form of Cubism (synthetic) where artists worked in mixed media.\nDoc 2(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") ntense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art. There is no denying the power of Picasso’s creative mind, and the effects of his stylistic experimentation in Cubism shaped the artistic movements that followed him. As an artist who would come to influence so many artists himself, Picasso is a pillar in the modern art world with a fascinating life full of inspiration.\nFrom https://news.masterworksfineart.com/2019/11/28/what-was-picassos-inspiration .\n* As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Historical and Legal Approach to the Study of Public Administration\") rative part concerns itself with the functioning of the public organizations.\nThe legal approach throws light on the legal framework in which the public administration operates but excludes other important and informal aspects like sociological and psychological dynamics at play and therefore is considered an incomplete approach by many scholars. However there were many other takers for it and in USA, Frank J Goodnow, was an important advocate of this legal approach.\nIn his book Politics and Administration he challenges Montesquieu’s theory of separation of power in the book Esprit De Lois which proposed three branches of power; legislative, executive and judiciary but highlighted the independence of judiciary from administrative as the sole recognition of judicial power.\nAccording to Goodnow, this in itself was not sufficient and that extreme form of this theory was incapable of application to any concrete political organization. Goodnow and his further work have greatly influenced the way the American Public Administration shaped up in the later years.\nYour email address will not be published.

Each school has to sustain itself. We’re all in this race to keep our doors open and that doesn’t really foster an ecosystemic mindset. I think all the structures and incentive systems need to support a commitment to the public good if we’re going to move beyond the current siloed, fragmented nature of the education system. And, that isn’t going to happen on its own. It has to be consciously reflected on and then involve a study of how nature works.\nThat’s really what taught me to be a photographer. It was following Lemurs around for three weeks in Madagascar and learning to see patterns and disruption, and what happens when a system is disrupted. I think we can learn a lot from nature as we reimagine our learning and education system.\n[00:43:30] Kelly Young: What all of you are pointing to is that we don’t have healthy communities or healthy ecosystems that go well beyond education. This work is about putting human relationship at the center of it, revitalizing communities that have been oppressed and suppressed for generations, and about how we restore their ability to govern, contribute, and create meaning of learning. And, not have it imposed on them.\n[00:44:29] Joe Hobot: I’d like to build off what Timothy said about the importance of recognizing community-based organizations as an integral partner in this journey. As we talk about the holistic approach to whole child development and building communities that are able to thrive, it’s important to note that community-based organizations have been at the forefront of these activities, including in our own efforts.\nWe are led and staffed by the community that we’re embedded in. And, there’s a relationship piece that’s already been demonstrated in and supported by the community-based organizations’ work. This is where we get into a new modicum of partnership, where public schools in some of the more progressive areas like Minneapolis or Portland have understood that this is not their place—that they need to partner and lift up the CBO’s to allow them to do the work. Because, they’re more effective at it and it’s humbling for the public education system to have to do that.\nIt comes back to that question: Where does public education lead? Well, they lead by stepping back and following, and providing technical assistance for the CBO’s, which are really out there. That’s the good news: they’re deployed within the field and they’re out there doing good work and have been for decades. What an asset. Let’s start leveraging and utilizing these assets.\nThe other good news is they’re already doing this work without fear of sanction or waiting for approval. It’s really putting a spotlight and connecting these partnerships and public education, and realizing that these solutions are already embedded within the community as reflected in CBO’s.\nAudience Q&A\nQ. What is the role of public libraries in an ecosystem?\nTimothy Jones: It depends on the actual assets and resources that are in the library. A library really has to be that cross-generational hub, whether virtually or in-person, where you have people in the community who are present. You have elders, young people, and teenagers that are there. It goes far beyond the books. The library is where you should be able to have community exhibitions and other community gatherings.\nThe library, in many ways, could be the nondenominational function that the church once was in the past, where people came together and where you got all of your information.\nLooking at hip-hop as the exemplar for building community and fostering knowledge could be powerful.

Concrete operational children can understand the concept of conservation which means that changing one quality (in this example, height or water level) can be compensated for by changes in another quality (width). Consequently, there is the same amount of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.\nDecentration: Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any object (such as the height of the glass) and instead consider the changes in other dimensions too (such as the width of the glass).

For example, they can methodically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length, while younger children approach a similar task in a haphazard way.\nThese new cognitive skills increase the child’s understanding of the physical world, however according to Piaget, they still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think in systematic scientific ways. For example, when asked which variables influence the period that a pendulum takes to complete its arc and given weights they can attach to strings in order to do experiments, most children younger than 12 perform biased experiments from which no conclusions can be drawn (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).\nInformation Processing\nChildren differ in their memory abilities, and these differences predict both their readiness for school and academic performance in school (PreBler, Krajewski, & Hasselhorn, 2013). During middle and late childhood children make strides in several areas of cognitive function including the capacity of working memory, their ability to pay attention, and their use of memory strategies. Both changes in the brain and experience foster these abilities.\nWorking Memory: The capacity of working memory expands during middle and late childhood, and research has suggested that both an increase in processing speed and the ability to inhibit irrelevant information from entering memory are contributing to the greater efficiency of working memory during this age (de Ribaupierre, 2002). Changes in myelination and synaptic pruning in the cortex are likely behind the increase in processing speed and ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli (Kail, McBride-Chang, Ferrer, Cho, & Shu, 2013).\nChildren with learning disabilities in math and reading often have difficulties with working memory (Alloway, 2009). They may struggle with following the directions of an assignment. When a task calls for multiple steps, children with poor working memory may miss steps because they may lose track of where they are in the task. Adults working with such children may need to communicate: Using more familiar vocabulary, using shorter sentences, repeating task instructions more frequently, and breaking more complex tasks into smaller more manageable steps. Some studies have also shown that more intensive training of working memory strategies, such as chunking, aid in improving the capacity of working memory in children with poor working memory (Alloway, Bibile, & Lau, 2013).\nAttention: As noted above, the ability to inhibit irrelevant information improves during this age group, with there being a sharp improvement in selective attention from age six into adolescence (Vakil, Blachstein, Sheinman, & Greenstein, 2009). Children also improve in their ability to shift their attention between tasks or different features of a task (Carlson, Zelazo, & Faja, 2013).

Classically trained in the European school, Picasso emerged as a symbolist, drawing on Impressionism through Munch and Post-Impressionism via Lautrec.

Art historians consider his late works direct dialogues with Old Masters such as Velazquez, Goya and Rembrandt. He lived most of his life in France, so Picasso knew the latest trends and schools of art. Accordingly, he studied Symbolism, which worked to build a visual language of the soul from imagery drawn from mythology and dreams. Picasso also drew on Impressionist Munch to explore the nature of souls. Clearly Lautrec influenced his palette and his choice of subjects – prostitutes and the poor – during his Blue period, so-called because of his blue and gray palette. In fact, much of Picasso’s early work experiments with color – beginning in 1897 in violet and green through the Blue and consequent Rose period and his orange and red palette. This led him to experiment with shape as well, following Cezanne – Post-Impressionism influenced by primitive art – and Rousseau – experiments in Naïve art. Picasso began to use more angular shapes and figures, as well as more color, as he worked toward founding cubism with Braque, where the artist analyzes a subject or shape, disassembles it, then reassembles it in an abstracted form. Working in cubism led Picasso to invent collage and work toward a second form of Cubism (synthetic) where artists worked in mixed media.\nDoc 2(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") ntense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life.

His father was an artist himself, was Picasso’s first and most formative art teacher. Picasso has one of the most prolific creative careers in history, and his work was not only loved by art lovers around the world, but it was also incredibly influential for artists everywhere. But what was Picasso’s inspiration? What inspired these famous works?\nPicasso went through many creative phases in his career. These phases have been labeled as “periods” and show the different styles and mediums he was experimenting with during that time in his life. Picasso's “Blue Period” started in 1901 and lasted until 1904. During this period, Picasso painted mostly in cool blue and green tones, sometimes using a warmer color to accent his works. These pieces have a melancholy about them, and are quite somber, featuring scenes of poverty and desolation. What was Picasso’s inspiration to start painting in this way? In the spring of 1901, one of Picasso’s dear friends, a painter and poet named Carlos Casagemas, committed suicide in a cafe in Paris. Picasso was deeply affected by his death, and sank into a depression that lasted several years. Picasso’s journey through his grief and depression is clearly reflected in his “Blue Period.”\nIn 1904, Picasso moved to Montmartre in Paris, and settled into the community of bohemian artists and creators there. Coming out of his depression over his friend’s death, Picasso moved on from dark and serious subjects in his paintings to more lighthearted compositions featuring harlequins, clowns and carnival performers. His color palette warmed up as well, with his paintings now bathed in reds, oranges, pinks and earth tones. This period would be known as Picasso's “Rose Period” and it lasted until 1906. So what can be credited with this major shift in his work? Picasso met a woman named Fernande Olivier in 1904 and they began a relationship that lasted seven years. Olivier would be the first of a long line of women who were muses and lovers to Picasso over the years. This relationship and the end of his bout of depression signaled a more positive phase of Picasso’s life. The overall tone of his work during this period is much more carefree and less somber.\nCiting beautiful women as inspiration would become a theme in Picasso’s life, all the way up until his death. Picasso has been quoted saying: “For me there are only two kinds of women, goddesses and doormats.” He often became obsessed with a young woman and she became an artistic muse for him, inspiring many works. All of the women Picasso took as either wives or lovers were painted by the artist. His second wife Jacqueline Roque was the subject of over 400 portraits by Picasso, and was a great source of inspiration to him.\nFrom 1906-1909 Picasso was heavily inspired by African art, after he was exposed to traditional African masks and other art objects coming from Africa into French museums in Paris. This phase has been called his “African Period,” and was a precursor to his most famous period, “Cubism.” Influenced by Paul Cezanne’s experimentation with three-dimensional spacing and perspective, Picasso and Georges Braque pioneered the artistic movement known as Cubism. This way of breaking down a form to its most basic forms and reconstructing them in an abstracted way is what Picasso is most known for.\nSo what can we say was Picasso's inspiration?\nThroughout his life, Picasso's inspiration came in many different forms. Whether it be working through his emotions, responding to a difficult life event, meeting a beautiful young woman, an intense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art.

But one of the more complicated sides of the equation is how schools should get involved. The issue boils down to this question: Are educators responsible for monitoring student behavior outside of school?\nThere’s been a lot of debate about this issue and whether it’s fair to get schools involved. But if the students being bullied and doing the bullying are all attending the same school, then it seems inevitable that some of the problem will leak over into class time or occur on school property. The effects of cyberbullying can also have a huge impact on how kids relate with each other in classes, how they perform and their involvement in after-school activities.\nHow should schools handle cyberbullying?\nCurrently, educators don’t have the ability to punish students who are guilty of cyberbullying. While schools can help get conversations started between parents and students, they can’t force students to take down content that may be offensive or harmful to another student. Basically, they can act as moderators, but their hands are tied when it comes to taking action.\nThat might soon be changing. Some states are considering legislation that would allow educators to regulate and punish bullying or harassment – even if it doesn’t take place at school, but on a site like Facebook or Twitter. In Iowa, the governor’s Bullying Prevention Summit, held last November, developed a proposal for a new law that would allow teachers to punish bullies and help victims.\n“Creating a caring environment at school is important for every student’s well-being,” explained Iowa Governor’s Bullying Prevention Summit website. “It affects how successfully youngsters can focus on learning as well as the other skills they need to develop to make the most of their potential and to be good citizens.”\nSome schools are concerned about being asked to police or monitor out-of-school behavior, but Governor Branstad said that for the most part, school administrators have supported the new idea.\n“One of the reasons is they feel under their present bullying law, they don’t have authority to deal with threats made against the lives or well-being of students that might be made on social media,” said Branstad. “So they want to have that authority to be able to protect a student that might be threatened.”\nIn New Zealand, the government is proposing something even more extreme: Allowing teachers who suspect a student of cyberbullying to search their smartphone and laptop for evidence of inappropriate activity. While some support this new law, a lot of schools, parents and students are concerned about the potential for violation of privacy and whether this is a role that schools should be thrust into.\nGetting schools involved\nWhile the role of schools in cyberbullying is still being worked out, there are ways that schools can get involved in incidents now. Larriann Curtis, who is the parent-education programming chairwoman for the Texas PTA, advises parents to talk to schools when cyberbullying occurs instead of confronting the parents of the bully face-to-face.\nSome other things that parents can do include:\n- Document the problems, conversations and interactions surrounding the cyberbullying incident from the incident itself to communication with the school\n- Remain in contact with school administrators about the problem if it continues\n- Ask the school to remove the bully from any classes the victim is in\n- Request the school’s written policy about cyberbullying\nSome schools that want to be proactive in preventing cyberbullying – or that have dealt with the problem – may also want to introduce an educational program about cyberbullying to help students, teachers and parents understand how to prevent it and deal with it.\nWhat role do you think schools should have when dealing with cyberbullying?

My stance on this is that teachers already have enough on their plate as it is. If little johnny is getting cyber bullied on a saturday night, is it really the schools problem? What i think is funny is that parents complain to the school and expect the school to do something about it when they can just go the source(the other kids parents) and the problem would be solved! So is it fair to involve the schools?\nOn a hunch i asked my roommate who has kids, he said that teachers should report any kind of cyberbullying and other things that students do even outside of school. I totally disagreed with this. I feel that teachers are teachers until they leave the campus. That person has their own life to go home to outside of work. Oh well, just wanted an opinion.

Schools have enough to deal with and experience has shown that they have very little power wrt bullying b/c they are hindered by so many laws from getting involved or disciplining in any real way.\nIf and when bullying happens on school grounds, then schools have jurisdiction to step in. However, on the internet, no jurisdiction. The best thing to do is to call the police b/c harassment is illegal at any age. Not to mention that bullies usually back down when an officer shows up on their doorstep and informs them (and their parents) what will happen if they persist. The police are always the best resource to combat bullying; in fact, that's why we pay their salaries: to keep the peace and ensure civility vs. escalation and/or vigilante justice.\n07-20-2011, 06:24 AM\nLocation: On the Chesapeake\n50,024 posts, read\n68,607,556 times\nReputation: 66712\nThe problem is that what happens on social media many times gets carried to school the next day where we then have to deal with it.\nWe probably had at least 2 dozen fights, mostly girls, this past year that were directly tied in with what someone posted on Facebook or somewhere else.\nSome students also put together a school **** page detailing the various activities that the girls named would do.

They should only go that far though.\nI also compeletly disagree that schools should make it their problem even when a student is outside school. Doing so is stretching their time and budget, which is hurting other students' education.

It needs to be addressed. It’s time. Now, cyber bullying is way too complicated to discuss in just one article or post. What can be focused on though is how schools should handle cyber bullying. How can schools tackle this issue, especially if it is outside the classroom?\nFirst off, there are individuals that say once the final bell rings, schools have no power to enforce a policy on what the students do. I would have to disagree with that. If it occurs outside of the class, it could potentially affect the student’s performance in class the following days or weeks. So what do we do since opinions are butting heads? A blog post from Motherlode suggested to have students confront bullying in different teaching methods, which was from a report on a New York City school. There are also states that are contemplating legislation that would approve educators to monitor and enforce punishment for cyber bullying, stated by Faronics. As of now, the best that educators can do is help students if they come to us. When that occurs, we should be at open arms for them and assist in any way we can. In addition, try to help protect the students before any situation could occur. Jay Cooper suggests easy to follow actions that can familiarize individuals about cyber bullying on CampusSuite.\nThe impact can vary on future classrooms. It all depends on how much authority schools will be given in the future. If schools are able to monitor students activity for harassment outside of the classroom, then it will not be as big of a factor than compared to now. It will certainly be contained. Students will be able to focus more on their education. It also will allow educators to be informed if students are struggling and put aside time for any individual consulting for that particular individual. However, this would bring up a whole new debate about student privacy. That’s for another time though. Overall, schools should be able to monitor students with cyber bullying. It is a problem in this day and age and it need to eliminated for the students to feel safe throughout the day, inside and outside of the classroom.\nStandards:\n5.2 Teachers create an environment that is physically and emotionally safe.\n6.2 Teachers share responsibility with parents and caregivers to support student learning, emotional and physical development and mental health.\n6.3 Teachers collaborate effectively with other teachers, administrators and school and district staff.\n6.4 Teachers collaborate effectively with the local community and community agencies, when and where appropriate, to promote a positive environment for student learning.\n7.1 Teachers understand, uphold and follow professional ethics, policies and legal codes of professional conduct.\n7.3 Teachers are agents of change who seek opportunities to positively impact teaching quality, school improvements and student achievement.\nThese standards are addressed because it is our job to protect the students in schools in order for them to have a safe and healthy learning environment at all times. Teachers should be in contact with the community and school district, as well as their co-workers, in order to promote the awareness of cyber bullying in order to increase preventative measures. They have important roles for the students to make them feel comfortable in their classroom.\nDoc 5(Title: \"Should schools be involved in cyberbullying policies ...\") or that have dealt with the problem – may also want to introduce an educational program about cyberbullying to help students, teachers and parents understand how to prevent it and deal with it.\nWhat role do you think schools should have when dealing with cyberbullying? Please let us know by sharing your thoughts below or on our Facebook page!\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, schools should indeed be involved in addressing cyberbullying. Here are several reasons:\n\n1. **Impact on School Environment**: Cyberbullying can significantly affect how students interact within the school setting, impacting their performance and engagement in academic activities.\n\n2. **School Authority**: If the cyberbullying involves students who are also enrolled in the school, it often spills over into the school environment, affecting the overall learning atmosphere.\n\n3. **Educational Role**: Schools can educate students about the importance of online behavior and the consequences of cyberbullying, helping to foster a culture of respect and understanding.\n\n4. **Legal Considerations**: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow schools to take action against cyberbullying that extends beyond the school premises. This suggests that schools are increasingly seen as having a role in such matters.\n\nGiven these points, the involvement of schools in addressing cyberbullying is crucial. </think>\nuserrepidresponse\n<answer> yes </answer>\n\nTherefore, schools should get involved in cyberbullying."

The key takeaway is their emphasis on staying focused on the core business activities. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer> Focusing on Core Business </answer>\n\nThis encapsulates Airbnb's primary strategy during the pandemic.",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> I need to know how Airbnb survived the pandemic. </think>\n<search> how Airbnb survived the pandemic </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"How Airbnb Survived The Pandemic—And How You Can Too\") Airbnb has come back from the brink. Mere months after the Covid-19 pandemic caused its bookings to drop over 70% and cut in half its valuation, the company has pulled off a dramatic recovery and is headed toward an IPO with an expected valuation of $30 billion. How Airbnb survived the pandemic serves a playbook for turning around your business.\nCertainly the company was buoyed by the $1 billion lifeline it received from private equity firm Silver Lake back in April. It also wisely cut nearly $1 billion in marketing costs and slashed executive salaries by half. Plus, the business is well-positioned to appeal to travelers who wanted to stay away from larger hotels and remote workers looking for long-term rentals. But the strategies that CEO Brian Chesky and other executives adopted during the crisis – focus on the core business, address customer emotions, and meet employee needs — enabled them to turnaround the company so quickly.\nScale Back to Move Forward\nChesky and the executive team quickly realized that substantive changes to the business were needed. \"Travel as we knew it is over,\" Chesky observed early on. \"It doesn't mean travel is over, just the travel we knew is over, and it's never coming back.\"\nSo they quickly refocused on Airbnb’s core business — home rentals – and streamlined ancillary offerings including “Experiences” and traditional hotel and luxury property listings. They also scaled back what had been aggressive bets on markets further afield such as transportation and media. Some of these were Chesky’s pet projects and seemed to hold greater potential for achieve the company’s lofty aspirations. But the leaders realized the company’s future depended upon a sole focus on the core business.\nHow about you? Have you stopped holding out for business to go back to “normal” and are you ready to make significant changes? How should you scale back to focus on your core? Are you willing to exit markets and abandon new opportunities so you can do fewer things better – and with fewer resources? Focus enables you to shore up value in the core driver of your future success.\nCare for Customers\nAirbnb assessed what customers were feeling and went to great lengths to address their emotions. Chesky and his executives understood customers would be reluctant to make new reservations given the uncertainty of travel restrictions and potential pandemic surges. So they decided to institute a blanket refund policy offering last-minute cancellations and full refunds. Initially the change wasn’t rolled out clearly and caused confusion and anger among some customers as well as hosts, but the company worked hard to rectify problems and reassure people it had their backs. In doing so, it provided relief for customers’ apprehensions and convinced hesitant people to proceed with bookings.\nAirbnb’s executives also understood customers’ fears about health and safety, so they introduced “Enhanced Cleaning” procedures and recommended hosts increase the time between guest stays. The changes were not mandatory, but hosts who adopted them were given a badge to display on their listings, thus conveying transparency and reassuring concerned customers.\nAirbnb went beyond the basics of customer service and assuaged their feelings. Are you focused on your customers’ emotions – or are you only concerned with operations and transactions? Do you understand how customers are feeling and what they want and expect now? By implementing changes designed specifically to address customers’ emotions, you earn their trust.\nProvide for Your People\nWhen Airbnb laid off nearly 2,000 employees, 25% of its workforce, back in May, Chesky was praised for the humility and sincerity with which he addressed employees. But in addition to compassion, the company provided real help for laid-off employees. They were allowed to keep company-issued laptops and U.S. employees received a year of health insurance. Airbnb posted a talent directory of departing employees so other empl\nDoc 2(Title: \"How Airbnb Beat The Covid-19 Virus - Forbes\") Going into 2020, Airbnb was growing at a rapid pace and aggressively expanding into new categories. So what could possibly go wrong?\nWell, within a couple months, the Covid-19 pandemic would shutdown the travel industry. And suddenly Airbnb was facing an existential crisis.\nBy April, the gross bookings for nights and experiences plunged by 72% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, from March to April, there were more cancellations than bookings!\nWhile the situation was certainly dire, the management team wasted little time in pursuing a major restructuring. The result was that—over time—the business started to improve. By June, there was actually a 1% increase in gross bookings.\nNow this is not to say that the business is no longer under pressure. The fact remains that revenues are still well off the levels of 2019. But then again, Airbnb has weathered the pandemic relatively well compared to other major travel operators, whether hotel chains or online marketplaces.\nSo why is this so? What did Airbnb do? Let’s take a look:\nCost Cutting: The mantra of Silicon Valley is high growth. But this philosophy makes no sense when the market is experiencing huge problems.\nIn the situation of Airbnb, management initiated a layoff of 25% of the workforce. There was also a steep reduction in discretionary and capital expenditures, a slashing of executive salaries and a suspension of all facilities build-outs.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nAirbnb CEO and founder, Brian Chesky, set forth this plan in a letter that was sent to employees and published on the company blog. He did not mince words, saying “I have to share some very sad news.” He would go on to be thoughtful, transparent and clear about the “hard truths.”\nChesky also set forth a variety of principles about how the restructuring would be handled:\n- Map all reductions to our future business strategy and the capabilities we will need.\n- Do as much as we can for those who are impacted.\n- Be unwavering in our commitment to diversity.\n- Optimize for 1:1 communication for those impacted.\n- Wait to communicate any decisions until all details are landed — transparency of only partial information can make matters worse.\nFocus On The Core Business: In the shareholder letter in the S-1, the founders noted: “When the pandemic hit, we knew we couldn’t pursue everything that we used to. We chose to focus on what is most unique about Airbnb—our core business of hosting. We got back to our roots and back to what is truly special about Airbnb—the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences. We scaled back investments that did not directly support the core of our host community.”\nThis move proved critical. As the pandemic deepened, people were looking more at local stays—and this played to the advantage of Airbnb. It was one of the biggest factors in the turnaround of the business.\nCreatively-led: When there are severe constraints and limitations, this can lead to even more inspiration. This was certainly the case with the Airbnb team. For example, when the in-person Experiences segment was suspended, this led to the creation of Online Experiences. It turned out to be an extremely popular offering.\nTrust: This is the heart of any successful business. But during times of crisis, it can be tempting to make short-term financial decisions that ultimately undermine trust.\nAn example of this quandary for Airbnb was about the spike in cancellations. Keep in mind that many were non-refundable. But to bolster the marketplace, Airbnb used more than $1 billion of its funding to provide refunds. There was also a commitment of up to $250 million for those hosts that were impacted by the cancellations.\nLong-Term Optimism: During the early days of the pandemic, it would have been easy to lose confidence in the vision of Airbnb. But the founders did not let this happen. They knew that the long-term prospects looked bright.\nAccording to the founders: “\nDoc 3(Title: \"Airbnb survived the pandemic and is on the cusp of an IPO\") Photo: Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images for International New York Time / Illustration by The Hustle\nAirbnb is back from the brink.\nSeven months removed from one of the darkest periods in CEO Brian Chesky’s tenure at the helm, things are looking a lot rosier.\nThe pandemic’s abrupt arrival in March brought travel to a halt, and with it, Airbnb saw a devastating drop in business. During one stretch, bookings in Europe were down 80% vs. the same period in 2019.\nHosts across the US were left with a cascading run of cancellations that threatened to cripple the company’s critical partners.\nShort on cash, Chesky laid off thousands\nHe refocused on Airbnb’s core travel business, scaling back aggressive bets like Experiences.\nChesky provided refunds to guests, then had to repair relations with hosts, using part of a $1B lifeline from private equity firm Silver Lake to help.\nSlowly, things started to turn\nWhile Americans weren’t traveling overseas as much, or even cross-country, remote work created a new demand for shorter distance stays.\nAverage stay length increased 18% to 4.27 days from January to June, while bookings recovered and outpaced 2019 levels during the same period.\nWith things back on track, the company recently filed to go public, setting the stage for a December IPO that will likely be one of the year’s hottest debuts.\nWho’s getting paid?\nNot me, but a lot of other people.\n- Founders: Chesky and fellow cofounders Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk are sitting pretty; Chesky’s stake is worth $3B to $4B.\n- Early investors: Y Combinator scored a 6% stake for $20k (this bet is going in the VC hall of fame) and legendary VC firm Sequoia got in early at the seed ($600k) and Series A ($7.2m) rounds.\n- Private Equity: Silver Lake lent the suddenly cash-strapped Airbnb $1B at an $18B valuation — roughly half what it was worth in 2017.\nIf this payday wasn’t enough, Airbnb just pulled a massive personnel coup, landing Apple’s former design chief, Sir Jony Ive.\nDoc 4(Title: \"How Airbnb Beat The Covid-19 Virus - Forbes\") e hosts that were impacted by the cancellations.\nLong-Term Optimism: During the early days of the pandemic, it would have been easy to lose confidence in the vision of Airbnb. But the founders did not let this happen. They knew that the long-term prospects looked bright.\nAccording to the founders: “A crisis brings you clarity about what is truly important.

He also has developed various online courses, such as for the COBOL and Python programming languages.\nDoc 5(Title: \"How Airbnb Can Survive COVID-19 After Burning US$1.2B Cash ...\") Last week (7 October), it was reported that vacation rental platform Airbnb has burned through more than US$1.2 billion in cash between mid-2019 and mid-2020.\nThis amounts to more than a third of its cash reserves, according to documents seen by tech news site The Information.\nAccording to The Information, the plunge in global travel has “eroded a balance sheet already weakened by big increases in spending on hiring and marketing.”\nThis raises questions on the fate of Airbnb and whether it would survive the Covid-19 crisis. How can they ever hold on despite the travel blackhole?\nHow COVID-19 Sent Airbnb Spiralling Downwards\nThe pandemic has impacted Airbnb and other travel businesses drastically as global travel came to a standstill.\nAirbnb’s revenue dropped 72 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 to US$335 million.\nIn March, it was reported that European short-term rental reservations had dropped by as much as 80 per cent.\nMeanwhile, revenue was down by more than 50 per cent in American urban destinations like New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, according to data from analysts at AirDNA.\nBy April, Airbnb’s valuation had plummeted to US$18 billion, nearly half of its previous high of US$31 billion.\nAirbnb had to dip into its cash reserves to pay out refunds for cancelled bookings as well as overheads, payroll expenses and more.\nA Bulk Of Cash Went To Travel Refunds\nIn the first quarter of this year, when Covid-19 first broke out, the company had to hand out travel refunds due to customers swiftly cancelling their bookings.\nUnlike Airbnb and Expedia, Booking.com typically collects payments on each reservation after the stay has occurred, which reduced the impact of travel refunds on its balance sheet.\nRefunds wiped out a huge portion of their cash reserves, underscoring how the pandemic depleted Airbnb’s reserves.\nWhile governments implemented lockdowns and global travel came to a standstill, another portion of the funds went to helping the business tide over and pay overheads such as salaries.\nSpending Cutbacks Weren’t Enough\nIn May this year, Airbnb announced a company-wide layoff that saw the retrenchment of 1,900 out of 7,500 employees in a bid to cut costs.\nThe 25 per cent staff cut was substantial in cost savings, but Airbnb gave a generous severance package to those who were let go. This includes several months’ pay, a year of healthcare, and help from Airbnb finding a new job.\nIt was also reported that its founders will forego their salaries for the next six months, and top executives will take a 50 per cent pay cut.\nThe financial documents seen by The Information revealed for the first time when exactly Airbnb reduced spending in the second quarter to try to offset revenue decline.\nThe biggest cuts apparently came from customer service and marketing.\nMeanwhile, spending on product development and general and administrative costs fell by nine per cent collectively over the same period.\nHowever, the second-quarter financials is not likely to reflect the full impact of Airbnb’s layoffs, which was made in the middle of the quarter.\nRegardless, the spending cutbacks weren’t enough to offset the plunge in revenue once the pandemic struck.\nLooming IPO May Save Airbnb From Its US$2B Debt\nIn April, Airbnb had raised US$2 billion in debt from investors at high interest rates amid escalating losses.\nThanks to the debt, Airbnb had US$4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in June.\nThe company still has a significant cash pile (two-thirds of their cash reserves), but how long can this even last?\nBefore the pandemic, the company had been planning on going public via a direct listing.\nA direct listing is where the company would list existing shares on the stock market but it wouldn’t sell new shares to raise cash.\nIt is instead looking to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) in December this year, and aims to raise around US$3 billion.\nReuters reported last wee\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems Airbnb survived the pandemic through several key strategies:\n1.

But the leaders realized the company’s future depended upon a sole focus on the core business.\nHow about you? Have you stopped holding out for business to go back to “normal” and are you ready to make significant changes? How should you scale back to focus on your core? Are you willing to exit markets and abandon new opportunities so you can do fewer things better – and with fewer resources? Focus enables you to shore up value in the core driver of your future success.\nCare for Customers\nAirbnb assessed what customers were feeling and went to great lengths to address their emotions. Chesky and his executives understood customers would be reluctant to make new reservations given the uncertainty of travel restrictions and potential pandemic surges. So they decided to institute a blanket refund policy offering last-minute cancellations and full refunds. Initially the change wasn’t rolled out clearly and caused confusion and anger among some customers as well as hosts, but the company worked hard to rectify problems and reassure people it had their backs. In doing so, it provided relief for customers’ apprehensions and convinced hesitant people to proceed with bookings.\nAirbnb’s executives also understood customers’ fears about health and safety, so they introduced “Enhanced Cleaning” procedures and recommended hosts increase the time between guest stays. The changes were not mandatory, but hosts who adopted them were given a badge to display on their listings, thus conveying transparency and reassuring concerned customers.\nAirbnb went beyond the basics of customer service and assuaged their feelings. Are you focused on your customers’ emotions – or are you only concerned with operations and transactions? Do you understand how customers are feeling and what they want and expect now? By implementing changes designed specifically to address customers’ emotions, you earn their trust.\nProvide for Your People\nWhen Airbnb laid off nearly 2,000 employees, 25% of its workforce, back in May, Chesky was praised for the humility and sincerity with which he addressed employees. But in addition to compassion, the company provided real help for laid-off employees. They were allowed to keep company-issued laptops and U.S. employees received a year of health insurance.

So what could possibly go wrong?\nWell, within a couple months, the Covid-19 pandemic would shutdown the travel industry. And suddenly Airbnb was facing an existential crisis.\nBy April, the gross bookings for nights and experiences plunged by 72% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, from March to April, there were more cancellations than bookings!\nWhile the situation was certainly dire, the management team wasted little time in pursuing a major restructuring. The result was that—over time—the business started to improve. By June, there was actually a 1% increase in gross bookings.\nNow this is not to say that the business is no longer under pressure. The fact remains that revenues are still well off the levels of 2019. But then again, Airbnb has weathered the pandemic relatively well compared to other major travel operators, whether hotel chains or online marketplaces.\nSo why is this so? What did Airbnb do? Let’s take a look:\nCost Cutting: The mantra of Silicon Valley is high growth. But this philosophy makes no sense when the market is experiencing huge problems.\nIn the situation of Airbnb, management initiated a layoff of 25% of the workforce. There was also a steep reduction in discretionary and capital expenditures, a slashing of executive salaries and a suspension of all facilities build-outs.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nAirbnb CEO and founder, Brian Chesky, set forth this plan in a letter that was sent to employees and published on the company blog. He did not mince words, saying “I have to share some very sad news.” He would go on to be thoughtful, transparent and clear about the “hard truths.”\nChesky also set forth a variety of principles about how the restructuring would be handled:\n- Map all reductions to our future business strategy and the capabilities we will need.\n- Do as much as we can for those who are impacted.\n- Be unwavering in our commitment to diversity.\n- Optimize for 1:1 communication for those impacted.\n- Wait to communicate any decisions until all details are landed — transparency of only partial information can make matters worse.\nFocus On The Core Business: In the shareholder letter in the S-1, the founders noted: “When the pandemic hit, we knew we couldn’t pursue everything that we used to. We chose to focus on what is most unique about Airbnb—our core business of hosting. We got back to our roots and back to what is truly special about Airbnb—the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences. We scaled back investments that did not directly support the core of our host community.”\nThis move proved critical. As the pandemic deepened, people were looking more at local stays—and this played to the advantage of Airbnb. It was one of the biggest factors in the turnaround of the business.\nCreatively-led: When there are severe constraints and limitations, this can lead to even more inspiration. This was certainly the case with the Airbnb team. For example, when the in-person Experiences segment was suspended, this led to the creation of Online Experiences. It turned out to be an extremely popular offering.\nTrust: This is the heart of any successful business. But during times of crisis, it can be tempting to make short-term financial decisions that ultimately undermine trust.\nAn example of this quandary for Airbnb was about the spike in cancellations. Keep in mind that many were non-refundable. But to bolster the marketplace, Airbnb used more than $1 billion of its funding to provide refunds. There was also a commitment of up to $250 million for those hosts that were impacted by the cancellations.\nLong-Term Optimism: During the early days of the pandemic, it would have been easy to lose confidence in the vision of Airbnb.

How can they ever hold on despite the travel blackhole?\nHow COVID-19 Sent Airbnb Spiralling Downwards\nThe pandemic has impacted Airbnb and other travel businesses drastically as global travel came to a standstill.\nAirbnb’s revenue dropped 72 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 to US$335 million.\nIn March, it was reported that European short-term rental reservations had dropped by as much as 80 per cent.\nMeanwhile, revenue was down by more than 50 per cent in American urban destinations like New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, according to data from analysts at AirDNA.\nBy April, Airbnb’s valuation had plummeted to US$18 billion, nearly half of its previous high of US$31 billion.\nAirbnb had to dip into its cash reserves to pay out refunds for cancelled bookings as well as overheads, payroll expenses and more.\nA Bulk Of Cash Went To Travel Refunds\nIn the first quarter of this year, when Covid-19 first broke out, the company had to hand out travel refunds due to customers swiftly cancelling their bookings.\nUnlike Airbnb and Expedia, Booking.com typically collects payments on each reservation after the stay has occurred, which reduced the impact of travel refunds on its balance sheet.\nRefunds wiped out a huge portion of their cash reserves, underscoring how the pandemic depleted Airbnb’s reserves.\nWhile governments implemented lockdowns and global travel came to a standstill, another portion of the funds went to helping the business tide over and pay overheads such as salaries.\nSpending Cutbacks Weren’t Enough\nIn May this year, Airbnb announced a company-wide layoff that saw the retrenchment of 1,900 out of 7,500 employees in a bid to cut costs.\nThe 25 per cent staff cut was substantial in cost savings, but Airbnb gave a generous severance package to those who were let go. This includes several months’ pay, a year of healthcare, and help from Airbnb finding a new job.\nIt was also reported that its founders will forego their salaries for the next six months, and top executives will take a 50 per cent pay cut.\nThe financial documents seen by The Information revealed for the first time when exactly Airbnb reduced spending in the second quarter to try to offset revenue decline.\nThe biggest cuts apparently came from customer service and marketing.\nMeanwhile, spending on product development and general and administrative costs fell by nine per cent collectively over the same period.\nHowever, the second-quarter financials is not likely to reflect the full impact of Airbnb’s layoffs, which was made in the middle of the quarter.\nRegardless, the spending cutbacks weren’t enough to offset the plunge in revenue once the pandemic struck.\nLooming IPO May Save Airbnb From Its US$2B Debt\nIn April, Airbnb had raised US$2 billion in debt from investors at high interest rates amid escalating losses.\nThanks to the debt, Airbnb had US$4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in June.\nThe company still has a significant cash pile (two-thirds of their cash reserves), but how long can this even last?\nBefore the pandemic, the company had been planning on going public via a direct listing.\nA direct listing is where the company would list existing shares on the stock market but it wouldn’t sell new shares to raise cash.\nIt is instead looking to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) in December this year, and aims to raise around US$3 billion.\nReuters reported last wee\n</information>\n\n\n\n\n</think>\n\nAirbnb survived the pandemic through strategic pivots, cost-cutting measures, and strong customer and employee support.

Mere months after the Covid-19 pandemic caused its bookings to drop over 70% and cut in half its valuation, the company has pulled off a dramatic recovery and is headed toward an IPO with an expected valuation of $30 billion. How Airbnb survived the pandemic serves a playbook for turning around your business.\nCertainly the company was buoyed by the $1 billion lifeline it received from private equity firm Silver Lake back in April. It also wisely cut nearly $1 billion in marketing costs and slashed executive salaries by half. Plus, the business is well-positioned to appeal to travelers who wanted to stay away from larger hotels and remote workers looking for long-term rentals. But the strategies that CEO Brian Chesky and other executives adopted during the crisis – focus on the core business, address customer emotions, and meet employee needs — enabled them to turnaround the company so quickly.\nScale Back to Move Forward\nChesky and the executive team quickly realized that substantive changes to the business were needed. \"Travel as we knew it is over,\" Chesky observed early on. \"It doesn't mean travel is over, just the travel we knew is over, and it's never coming back.\"\nSo they quickly refocused on Airbnb’s core business — home rentals – and streamlined ancillary offerings including “Experiences” and traditional hotel and luxury property listings. They also scaled back what had been aggressive bets on markets further afield such as transportation and media. Some of these were Chesky’s pet projects and seemed to hold greater potential for achieve the company’s lofty aspirations.

Mere months after the Covid-19 pandemic caused its bookings to drop over 70% and cut in half its valuation, the company has pulled off a dramatic recovery and is headed toward an IPO with an expected valuation of $30 billion. How Airbnb survived the pandemic serves a playbook for turning around your business.\nCertainly the company was buoyed by the $1 billion lifeline it received from private equity firm Silver Lake back in April. It also wisely cut nearly $1 billion in marketing costs and slashed executive salaries by half. Plus, the business is well-positioned to appeal to travelers who wanted to stay away from larger hotels and remote workers looking for long-term rentals. But the strategies that CEO Brian Chesky and other executives adopted during the crisis – focus on the core business, address customer emotions, and meet employee needs — enabled them to turnaround the company so quickly.\nScale Back to Move Forward\nChesky and the executive team quickly realized that substantive changes to the business were needed. \"Travel as we knew it is over,\" Chesky observed early on. \"It doesn't mean travel is over, just the travel we knew is over, and it's never coming back.\"\nSo they quickly refocused on Airbnb’s core business — home rentals – and streamlined ancillary offerings including “Experiences” and traditional hotel and luxury property listings. They also scaled back what had been aggressive bets on markets further afield such as transportation and media. Some of these were Chesky’s pet projects and seemed to hold greater potential for achieve the company’s lofty aspirations. But the leaders realized the company’s future depended upon a sole focus on the core business.\nHow about you? Have you stopped holding out for business to go back to “normal” and are you ready to make significant changes? How should you scale back to focus on your core? Are you willing to exit markets and abandon new opportunities so you can do fewer things better – and with fewer resources? Focus enables you to shore up value in the core driver of your future success.\nCare for Customers\nAirbnb assessed what customers were feeling and went to great lengths to address their emotions. Chesky and his executives understood customers would be reluctant to make new reservations given the uncertainty of travel restrictions and potential pandemic surges. So they decided to institute a blanket refund policy offering last-minute cancellations and full refunds. Initially the change wasn’t rolled out clearly and caused confusion and anger among some customers as well as hosts, but the company worked hard to rectify problems and reassure people it had their backs. In doing so, it provided relief for customers’ apprehensions and convinced hesitant people to proceed with bookings.\nAirbnb’s executives also understood customers’ fears about health and safety, so they introduced “Enhanced Cleaning” procedures and recommended hosts increase the time between guest stays. The changes were not mandatory, but hosts who adopted them were given a badge to display on their listings, thus conveying transparency and reassuring concerned customers.\nAirbnb went beyond the basics of customer service and assuaged their feelings. Are you focused on your customers’ emotions – or are you only concerned with operations and transactions? Do you understand how customers are feeling and what they want and expect now? By implementing changes designed specifically to address customers’ emotions, you earn their trust.\nProvide for Your People\nWhen Airbnb laid off nearly 2,000 employees, 25% of its workforce, back in May, Chesky was praised for the humility and sincerity with which he addressed employees. But in addition to compassion, the company provided real help for laid-off employees. They were allowed to keep company-issued laptops and U.S. employees received a year of health insurance. Airbnb posted a talent directory of departing employees so other empl\nDoc 2(Title: \"How Airbnb Beat The Covid-19 Virus - Forbes\") Going into 2020, Airbnb was growing at a rapid pace and aggressively expanding into new categories. So what could possibly go wrong?\nWell, within a couple months, the Covid-19 pandemic would shutdown the travel industry. And suddenly Airbnb was facing an existential crisis.\nBy April, the gross bookings for nights and experiences plunged by 72% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, from March to April, there were more cancellations than bookings!\nWhile the situation was certainly dire, the management team wasted little time in pursuing a major restructuring. The result was that—over time—the business started to improve. By June, there was actually a 1% increase in gross bookings.\nNow this is not to say that the business is no longer under pressure. The fact remains that revenues are still well off the levels of 2019. But then again, Airbnb has weathered the pandemic relatively well compared to other major travel operators, whether hotel chains or online marketplaces.\nSo why is this so? What did Airbnb do? Let’s take a look:\nCost Cutting: The mantra of Silicon Valley is high growth. But this philosophy makes no sense when the market is experiencing huge problems.\nIn the situation of Airbnb, management initiated a layoff of 25% of the workforce. There was also a steep reduction in discretionary and capital expenditures, a slashing of executive salaries and a suspension of all facilities build-outs.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nAirbnb CEO and founder, Brian Chesky, set forth this plan in a letter that was sent to employees and published on the company blog. He did not mince words, saying “I have to share some very sad news.” He would go on to be thoughtful, transparent and clear about the “hard truths.”\nChesky also set forth a variety of principles about how the restructuring would be handled:\n- Map all reductions to our future business strategy and the capabilities we will need.\n- Do as much as we can for those who are impacted.\n- Be unwavering in our commitment to diversity.\n- Optimize for 1:1 communication for those impacted.\n- Wait to communicate any decisions until all details are landed — transparency of only partial information can make matters worse.\nFocus On The Core Business: In the shareholder letter in the S-1, the founders noted: “When the pandemic hit, we knew we couldn’t pursue everything that we used to. We chose to focus on what is most unique about Airbnb—our core business of hosting. We got back to our roots and back to what is truly special about Airbnb—the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences. We scaled back investments that did not directly support the core of our host community.”\nThis move proved critical. As the pandemic deepened, people were looking more at local stays—and this played to the advantage of Airbnb. It was one of the biggest factors in the turnaround of the business.\nCreatively-led: When there are severe constraints and limitations, this can lead to even more inspiration. This was certainly the case with the Airbnb team. For example, when the in-person Experiences segment was suspended, this led to the creation of Online Experiences. It turned out to be an extremely popular offering.\nTrust: This is the heart of any successful business. But during times of crisis, it can be tempting to make short-term financial decisions that ultimately undermine trust.\nAn example of this quandary for Airbnb was about the spike in cancellations. Keep in mind that many were non-refundable. But to bolster the marketplace, Airbnb used more than $1 billion of its funding to provide refunds. There was also a commitment of up to $250 million for those hosts that were impacted by the cancellations.\nLong-Term Optimism: During the early days of the pandemic, it would have been easy to lose confidence in the vision of Airbnb. But the founders did not let this happen. They knew that the long-term prospects looked bright.\nAccording to the founders: “\nDoc 3(Title: \"Airbnb survived the pandemic and is on the cusp of an IPO\") Photo: Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images for International New York Time / Illustration by The Hustle\nAirbnb is back from the brink.\nSeven months removed from one of the darkest periods in CEO Brian Chesky’s tenure at the helm, things are looking a lot rosier.\nThe pandemic’s abrupt arrival in March brought travel to a halt, and with it, Airbnb saw a devastating drop in business. During one stretch, bookings in Europe were down 80% vs. the same period in 2019.\nHosts across the US were left with a cascading run of cancellations that threatened to cripple the company’s critical partners.\nShort on cash, Chesky laid off thousands\nHe refocused on Airbnb’s core travel business, scaling back aggressive bets like Experiences.\nChesky provided refunds to guests, then had to repair relations with hosts, using part of a $1B lifeline from private equity firm Silver Lake to help.\nSlowly, things started to turn\nWhile Americans weren’t traveling overseas as much, or even cross-country, remote work created a new demand for shorter distance stays.\nAverage stay length increased 18% to 4.27 days from January to June, while bookings recovered and outpaced 2019 levels during the same period.\nWith things back on track, the company recently filed to go public, setting the stage for a December IPO that will likely be one of the year’s hottest debuts.\nWho’s getting paid?\nNot me, but a lot of other people.\n- Founders: Chesky and fellow cofounders Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk are sitting pretty; Chesky’s stake is worth $3B to $4B.\n- Early investors: Y Combinator scored a 6% stake for $20k (this bet is going in the VC hall of fame) and legendary VC firm Sequoia got in early at the seed ($600k) and Series A ($7.2m) rounds.\n- Private Equity: Silver Lake lent the suddenly cash-strapped Airbnb $1B at an $18B valuation — roughly half what it was worth in 2017.\nIf this payday wasn’t enough, Airbnb just pulled a massive personnel coup, landing Apple’s former design chief, Sir Jony Ive.\nDoc 4(Title: \"How Airbnb Beat The Covid-19 Virus - Forbes\") e hosts that were impacted by the cancellations.\nLong-Term Optimism: During the early days of the pandemic, it would have been easy to lose confidence in the vision of Airbnb.

How can they ever hold on despite the travel blackhole?\nHow COVID-19 Sent Airbnb Spiralling Downwards\nThe pandemic has impacted Airbnb and other travel businesses drastically as global travel came to a standstill.\nAirbnb’s revenue dropped 72 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 to US$335 million.\nIn March, it was reported that European short-term rental reservations had dropped by as much as 80 per cent.\nMeanwhile, revenue was down by more than 50 per cent in American urban destinations like New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, according to data from analysts at AirDNA.\nBy April, Airbnb’s valuation had plummeted to US$18 billion, nearly half of its previous high of US$31 billion.\nAirbnb had to dip into its cash reserves to pay out refunds for cancelled bookings as well as overheads, payroll expenses and more.\nA Bulk Of Cash Went To Travel Refunds\nIn the first quarter of this year, when Covid-19 first broke out, the company had to hand out travel refunds due to customers swiftly cancelling their bookings.\nUnlike Airbnb and Expedia, Booking.com typically collects payments on each reservation after the stay has occurred, which reduced the impact of travel refunds on its balance sheet.\nRefunds wiped out a huge portion of their cash reserves, underscoring how the pandemic depleted Airbnb’s reserves.\nWhile governments implemented lockdowns and global travel came to a standstill, another portion of the funds went to helping the business tide over and pay overheads such as salaries.\nSpending Cutbacks Weren’t Enough\nIn May this year, Airbnb announced a company-wide layoff that saw the retrenchment of 1,900 out of 7,500 employees in a bid to cut costs.\nThe 25 per cent staff cut was substantial in cost savings, but Airbnb gave a generous severance package to those who were let go. This includes several months’ pay, a year of healthcare, and help from Airbnb finding a new job.\nIt was also reported that its founders will forego their salaries for the next six months, and top executives will take a 50 per cent pay cut.\nThe financial documents seen by The Information revealed for the first time when exactly Airbnb reduced spending in the second quarter to try to offset

The changes were not mandatory, but hosts who adopted them were given a badge to display on their listings, thus conveying transparency and reassuring concerned customers.\nAirbnb went beyond the basics of customer service and assuaged their feelings. Are you focused on your customers’ emotions – or are you only concerned with operations and transactions? Do you understand how customers are feeling and what they want and expect now? By implementing changes designed specifically to address customers’ emotions, you earn their trust.\nProvide for Your People\nWhen Airbnb laid off nearly 2,000 employees, 25% of its workforce, back in May, Chesky was praised for the humility and sincerity with which he addressed employees. But in addition to compassion, the company provided real help for laid-off employees. They were allowed to keep company-issued laptops and U.S. employees received a year of health insurance.

So what could possibly go wrong?\nWell, within a couple months, the Covid-19 pandemic would shutdown the travel industry. And suddenly Airbnb was facing an existential crisis.\nBy April, the gross bookings for nights and experiences plunged by 72% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, from March to April, there were more cancellations than bookings!\nWhile the situation was certainly dire, the management team wasted little time in pursuing a major restructuring. The result was that—over time—the business started to improve. By June, there was actually a 1% increase in gross bookings.\nNow this is not to say that the business is no longer under pressure. The fact remains that revenues are still well off the levels of 2019. But then again, Airbnb has weathered the pandemic relatively well compared to other major travel operators, whether hotel chains or online marketplaces.\nSo why is this so? What did Airbnb do? Let’s take a look:\nCost Cutting: The mantra of Silicon Valley is high growth. But this philosophy makes no sense when the market is experiencing huge problems.\nIn the situation of Airbnb, management initiated a layoff of 25% of the workforce. There was also a steep reduction in discretionary and capital expenditures, a slashing of executive salaries and a suspension of all facilities build-outs.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nAirbnb CEO and founder, Brian Chesky, set forth this plan in a letter that was sent to employees and published on the company blog. He did not mince words, saying “I have to share some very sad news.” He would go on to be thoughtful, transparent and clear about the “hard truths.”\nChesky also set forth a variety of principles about how the restructuring would be handled:\n- Map all reductions to our future business strategy and the capabilities we will need.\n- Do as much as we can for those who are impacted.\n- Be unwavering in our commitment to diversity.\n- Optimize for 1:1 communication for those impacted.\n- Wait to communicate any decisions until all details are landed — transparency of only partial information can make matters worse.\nFocus On The Core Business: In the shareholder letter in the S-1, the founders noted: “When the pandemic hit, we knew we couldn’t pursue everything that we used to. We chose to focus on what is most unique about Airbnb—our core business of hosting. We got back to our roots and back to what is truly special about Airbnb—the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences. We scaled back investments that did not directly support the core of our host community.”\nThis move proved critical. As the pandemic deepened, people were looking more at local stays—and this played to the advantage of Airbnb. It was one of the biggest factors in the turnaround of the business.\nCreatively-led: When there are severe constraints and limitations, this can lead to even more inspiration. This was certainly the case with the Airbnb team. For example, when the in-person Experiences segment was suspended, this led to the creation of Online Experiences. It turned out to be an extremely popular offering.\nTrust: This is the heart of any successful business. But during times of crisis, it can be tempting to make short-term financial decisions that ultimately undermine trust.\nAn example of this quandary for Airbnb was about the spike in cancellations. Keep in mind that many were non-refundable. But to bolster the marketplace, Airbnb used more than $1 billion of its funding to provide refunds. There was also a commitment of up to $250 million for those hosts that were impacted by the cancellations.\nLong-Term Optimism: During the early days of the pandemic, it would have been easy to lose confidence in the vision of Airbnb. But the founders did not let this happen. They knew that the long-term prospects looked bright.\nAccording to the founders: “\nDoc 3(Title: \"Airbnb survived the pandemic and is on the cusp of an IPO\") Photo: Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images for International New York Time / Illustration by The Hustle\nAirbnb is back from the brink.\nSeven months removed from one of the darkest periods in CEO Brian Chesky’s tenure at the helm, things are looking a lot rosier.\nThe pandemic’s abrupt arrival in March brought travel to a halt, and with it, Airbnb saw a devastating drop in business.

How can they ever hold on despite the travel blackhole?\nHow COVID-19 Sent Airbnb Spiralling Downwards\nThe pandemic has impacted Airbnb and other travel businesses drastically as global travel came to a standstill.\nAirbnb’s revenue dropped 72 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 to US$335 million.\nIn March, it was reported that European short-term rental reservations had dropped by as much as 80 per cent.\nMeanwhile, revenue was down by more than 50 per cent in American urban destinations like New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, according to data from analysts at AirDNA.\nBy April, Airbnb’s valuation had plummeted to US$18 billion, nearly half of its previous high of US$31 billion.\nAirbnb had to dip into its cash reserves to pay out refunds for cancelled bookings as well as overheads, payroll expenses and more.\nA Bulk Of Cash Went To Travel Refunds\nIn the first quarter of this year, when Covid-19 first broke out, the company had to hand out travel refunds due to customers swiftly cancelling their bookings.\nUnlike Airbnb and Expedia, Booking.com typically collects payments on each reservation after the stay has occurred, which reduced the impact of travel refunds on its balance sheet.\nRefunds wiped out a huge portion of their cash reserves, underscoring how the pandemic depleted Airbnb’s reserves.\nWhile governments implemented lockdowns and global travel came to a standstill, another portion of the funds went to helping the business tide over and pay overheads such as salaries.\nSpending Cutbacks Weren’t Enough\nIn May this year, Airbnb announced a company-wide layoff that saw the retrenchment of 1,900 out of 7,500 employees in a bid to cut costs.\nThe 25 per cent staff cut was substantial in cost savings, but Airbnb gave a generous severance package to those who were let go. This includes several months’ pay, a year of healthcare, and help from Airbnb finding a new job.\nIt was also reported that its founders will forego their salaries for the next six months, and top executives will take a 50 per cent pay cut.\nThe financial documents seen by The Information revealed for the first time when exactly Airbnb reduced spending in the second quarter to try to offset revenue decline.\nThe biggest cuts apparently came from customer service and marketing.\nMeanwhile, spending on product development and general and administrative costs fell by nine per cent collectively over the same period.\nHowever, the second-quarter financials is not likely to reflect the full impact of Airbnb’s layoffs, which was made in the middle of the quarter.\nRegardless, the spending cutbacks weren’t enough to offset the plunge in revenue once the pandemic struck.\nLooming IPO May Save Airbnb From Its US$2B Debt\nIn April, Airbnb had raised US$2 billion in debt from investors at high interest rates amid escalating losses.\nThanks to the debt, Airbnb had US$4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in June.\nThe company still has a significant cash pile (two-thirds of their cash reserves), but how long can this even last?\nBefore the pandemic, the company had been planning on going public via a direct listing.\nA direct listing is where the company would list existing shares on the stock market but it wouldn’t sell new shares to raise cash.\nIt is instead looking to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) in December this year, and aims to raise around US$3 billion.\nReuters reported last wee\n</information>\n\n\n\n\n </think>\n\nAirbnb successfully navigated the pandemic by focusing on its core business and cutting costs effectively.

Mere months after the Covid-19 pandemic caused its bookings to drop over 70% and cut in half its valuation, the company has pulled off a dramatic recovery and is headed toward an IPO with an expected valuation of $30 billion. How Airbnb survived the pandemic serves a playbook for turning around your business.\nCertainly the company was buoyed by the $1 billion lifeline it received from private equity firm Silver Lake back in April. It also wisely cut nearly $1 billion in marketing costs and slashed executive salaries by half. Plus, the business is well-positioned to appeal to travelers who wanted to stay away from larger hotels and remote workers looking for long-term rentals. But the strategies that CEO Brian Chesky and other executives adopted during the crisis – focus on the core business, address customer emotions, and meet employee needs — enabled them to turnaround the company so quickly.\nScale Back to Move Forward\nChesky and the executive team quickly realized that substantive changes to the business were needed. \"Travel as we knew it is over,\" Chesky observed early on. \"It doesn't mean travel is over, just the travel we knew is over, and it's never coming back.\"\nSo they quickly refocused on Airbnb’s core business — home rentals – and streamlined ancillary offerings including “Experiences” and traditional hotel and luxury property listings. They also scaled back what had been aggressive bets on markets further afield such as transportation and media. Some of these were Chesky’s pet projects and seemed to hold greater potential for achieve the company’s lofty aspirations. But the leaders realized the company’s future depended upon a sole focus on the core business.\nHow about you? Have you stopped holding out for business to go back to “normal” and are you ready to make significant changes? How should you scale back to focus on your core? Are you willing to exit markets and abandon new opportunities so you can do fewer things better – and with fewer resources? Focus enables you to shore up value in the core driver of your future success.\nCare for Customers\nAirbnb assessed what customers were feeling and went to great lengths to address their emotions. Chesky and his executives understood customers would be reluctant to make new reservations given the uncertainty of travel restrictions and potential pandemic surges. So they decided to institute a blanket refund policy offering last-minute cancellations and full refunds. Initially the change wasn’t rolled out clearly and caused confusion and anger among some customers as well as hosts, but the company worked hard to rectify problems and reassure people it had their backs. In doing so, it provided relief for customers’ apprehensions and convinced hesitant people to proceed with bookings.\nAirbnb’s executives also understood customers’ fears about health and safety, so they introduced “Enhanced Cleaning” procedures and recommended hosts increase the time between guest stays.

Instead you take it to the cashier and they calculate the price. What you pay could be twice as much, or more, than an hour earlier. That’s if there is even anything left in stock.\nThis is the economic reality that underpins Venezuela’s current “political crisis” – though in truth that crisis has been going on for years.\nThe government headed by Nicolás Maduro, who has presided over Venezuela since 2013, declared a state of emergency in 2016. That year the inflation rate hit 800%. Things have since gone from bad to worse.\nBy 2018 inflation was an estimated 80,000%. It’s difficult to say what the rate is now, but Bloomberg’s Venezuelan Cafe Con Leche Index, based on the price of a cup of coffee, suggests it is now about 380,000%.\nAbout 3 million Venezuelans – a tenth of the population – have fled the country. This is the largest human displacement in Latin American history, driven by shortages of everything including food as well as the Maduro regime’s oppressive treatment of dissent.\nRead more: Venezuela is fast becoming a 'mafia state': here's what you need to know\nNo wonder, then, that Maduro, who has just begun his second term as president, is now under considerable domestic and international pressure to call new elections.\nSo how did things get so bad? How did inflation become hyperinflation in Venezuela? And how do Venezuelans deal with it?\nThe cost of goods and the value of currency\nWhat we pay for goods and services reflects not only their cost of production but also of the value of the currency we buy them in. If that currency loses value against the currency the goods are sold in, the price of those goods goes up.\nBy 2014 the value of Venezuela’s currency, the bolívar, and the prosperity of the Venezuelan economy, was highly dependent on oil exports. More than 90% of the country’s export earnings came from oil.\nThese export earnings had enabled the government headed by Hugo Chavez from 1999 to 2013 to pay for social programs intended to combat poverty and inequality. From subsidies for those on low incomes to health services, the government’s spending obligations were high.\nThen the global price of oil dropped. Foreign demand for the bolívar to buy Venezuelan oil crashed. As the currency’s value fell, the cost of imported goods rose. The Venezuelan economy went into crisis.\nThe solution of Venezuela’s new president Nicolas Maduro, who succeeded Chavez in March 2013, was to print more money.\nThat might seem silly, but it can keep the economy moving while it gets over a hump caused by a short-term price shock.\nThe Venezuelan crisis, however, just got worse as the oil price continued to fall, compounded by other factors that reduced Venezuelan oil output. International investors began looking elsewhere, driving the value of the bolívar even lower.\nRead more: Curious Kids: why don’t poorer countries just print more money?\nIn these conditions, printing more money simply made the problem worse. It added to the supply of currency, pushing the value down even further. As prices rose, the government printed more money to pay its bills. This cycle is what causes hyperinflation.\nPlaying the currency market\nCircumstances like these quickly make saving money in the local currency nonsensical. To protect themselves, Venezuelans started to convert their savings into a more stable currency, like the US dollar. This lowered the value of the bolívar even further.\nThe government responded by issuing currency controls. It set a fixed exchange rate, to stop the official value of the bolívar dropping against the US dollar, and made it difficult to actually get permission to exchange bolívares into US dollars. The idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions.\nUS dollars were still available on the black market, however. This meant going to any number of operators on the streets of downtown Caracas or asking a friend to hoo\nDoc 3(Title: \"Venezuela Inflation Calculator: VEF from 1980 to 2020\") $100 in 1980 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $14,014,141,891,526.36 today, an increase of $14,014,141,891,426.36 over 41 years. The bolivar had an average inflation rate of 87.01% per year between 1980 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of 14,014,141,891,426.36%.\nThis means that today's prices are 140,141,418,915.26 times as high as average prices since 1980, according to the International Monetary Fund consumer price index. A bolivar today only buys NaN% of what it could buy back then.\nThe inflation rate in 1980 was 21.40%. The current inflation rate compared to the end of last year is now 2,700.00%. If this number holds, $100 today will be equivalent in buying power to $2,800.00 next year.\nThis chart shows a calculation of buying power equivalence for $100 in 1980 (price index tracking began in 1979).\nFor example, if you started with $100, you would need to end with $14,014,141,891,526.36 in order to \"adjust\" for inflation (sometimes refered to as \"beating inflation\").\nWhen $100 is equivalent to $14,014,141,891,526.36 over time, that means that the \"real value\" of a single Venezuelan bolivar decreases over time. In other words, a bolivar will pay for fewer items at the store.\nThis effect explains how inflation erodes the value of a bolivar over time. By calculating the value in 1980 dollars, the chart below shows how $100 is worth less over 41 years.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, each of these VEF amounts below is equal in terms of what it could buy at the time:\nThis conversion table shows various other 1980 amounts in today's bolivars, based on the 14,014,141,891,426.36% change in prices:\nOur calculations use the following inflation rate formula to calculate the change in value between 1980 and today:\nThen plug in historical CPI values. The Venezuelan CPI was 121.4 in the year 1980 and 17013168256313 in 2021:\n$100 in 1980 has the same \"purchasing power\" or \"buying power\" as $14,014,141,891,526.36 in 2021.\nTo get the total inflation rate for the 41 years between 1980 and 2021, we use the following formula:\nPlugging in the values to this equation, we get:\nRaw data for these calculations comes from the government of Venezuela's annual (CPI) as provided by the International Monetary Fund.\nYou may use the following MLA citation for this page: “Venezuela Inflation Calculator: VEF from 1980 to 2021.” Official Inflation Data, Alioth Finance, 26 Oct. 2025, https://www.officialdata.org/venezuela-inflation.\nSpecial thanks to QuickChart for their chart image API, which is used for chart downloads.\nin2013dollars.com is a reference website maintained by the Official Data Foundation.\nDoc 4(Title: \"What caused hyperinflation in Venezuela: a rare blend of ...\") to exchange bolívares into US dollars. The idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions.\nUS dollars were still available on the black market, however. This meant going to any number of operators on the streets of downtown Caracas or asking a friend to hook you up. As the crisis deepened, more and more Venezuelans looked to switch their bolívares into US dollars.\nThis increasing demand meant the black market price for greenbacks rose, creating a difference between the official exchange rate (set by the government) and the unofficial going rate.\nWith this came new opportunities. In 2014 reports emerged that groups of middle-aged women were crossing the border to use ATMs in Colombia. They could withdraw funds from their Venezuelan accounts as US dollars at the official rate. They could then cross back into Venezuela and exchange the dollars for bolívares at the unofficial rate, making a tidy profit. Government officials able to exchange bolívares for US dollars within Venezuela had their own version of this practice.\nThis pushed the price of US dollars up, and that of bolívars down, even more. As the crisis deepened increasing numbers of ordinary Venezuelans began to engage in the unofficial currency market.\nSometimes this took the form of taking subsidised Venezuelan goods like food across the border to sell. This earned the sellers foreign currency, but it also exacerbated shortages of goods within the country, driving prices up even further.\nThis does not mean Venezuela’s currency crisis is the fault of ordinary Venezuelans. Illegal economic activity is largely a coping mechanism, a bellwether of the actual economy’s ability to provide for people. When a government fails its responsibilities, it should be no surprise that people protect themselves through unofficial currency trading. This is exactly what big international investors do all the time, albeit through more official channels.\nCannot be trusted\nBy August 2018 the Venezuelan currency was worth so little that it was more prudent to use cash for toilet paper rather than buy toilet paper.\nThe government tried to get on top of this situation by issuing a currency devaluation. Maduro devalued the bolívar by 95%, the largest currency devaluation in contemporary world history. He also tied the new currency to the price of oil, an economic experiment designed to show the Venezuelan economy had solid foundations.\nBy bringing the bolívar’s value into line with the reality of what people actually thought it was worth, and showing it was backed by something valuable, oil, Maduro’s government hoped Venezuelans would believe in their own currency and not exchange it for dollars. This would help stabilise the economy overall.\nBut within weeks of the devaluation it was clear ordinary Venezuelans had not been convinced.\nThey had no reason to be, given the government was not addressing other issues, such as policies contributing to low productivity across the economy. The government’s increasing authoritarianism, including interfering with the constitution and elections, also signalled it was not to be trusted.\nRead more: Is authoritarianism bad for the economy? Ask Venezuela – or Hungary or Turkey\nHyperinflation is a very difficult hole out of which to climb. Very few economies ever experience it, and it’s hard to stop it without massively cutting government spending.\nIt is easy, then, to see why millions of Venezuelans responded by dealing in the black market or taking their savings, and themselves, out the country altogether.\nAs the political crisis in the country deepens, Venezuelans will have to continue to seek ways to allow them to survive the storm any way they can.\nDoc 5(Title: \"Methods to Control Inflation - Economics Help\") d to leave the ERM in 1992.\n6. Ways to Reduce Hyperinflation – change currency\nIn a period of hyperinflation, conventional policies may be unsuitable. Expectations of future inflation may be hard to change. When people have lost confidence in a currency, it may be necessary to introduce a new currency or use another like the dollar (e.g. Zimbabwe hyperinflation).\nWays to reduce Cost-Push Inflation\nCost-push inflation (e.g. due to rising oil prices) can lead to inflation and lower growth. This is the worst of both worlds and is more difficult to control without leading to lower growth. In 2022 the world saw a rise in cost-push inflation due to rising energy prices and the end of Covid lockdown causing supply shortages.\nCost-push inflation is more difficult to reduce because it is fundamentally caused by supply problems. Raising interest rates is a blunt tool and likely to cause unacceptably lower growth. This is why Central Banks tend to tolerate a higher rate of cost-push inflation and hope it is short-lived. In the long-term we can try and tackle the supply issues, such as more flexible labour markets, stock-piling oil reserves to deal with crises and policies to increase competitiveness.\nFurther reading\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems Venezuela's inflation rate has been extremely high, especially in recent years.

Regardless of what I’ve been going through over the years, I’ve learned that there will always be someone enduring even greater struggles. Yes, I have barriers and limitations with my heart defect that affect my social life. For example, if I happen to fall or trip, I have more concerns than others because I am on a blood thinner, which means my bleeding won’t stop easily. I often ponder when precisely the best time is to disclose my heart defect to new friends, it is a tough balance between realizing that it is such a significant part of my life and who I am while also avoiding the “poor me” mentality that can come with the disclosure. But my fellow young adult heart patient peers and I often ask ourselves this question: If it wasn’t for our heart defects, how exactly would our social lives be different? Would we be playing contact sports or having more than two alcoholic beverages when we’re out with friends? For me, the answer is easy. No, it wouldn’t be much different.\nLet me address one barrier at a time. First: restrictions on contact sports. Growing up, I was a stereotypical “theater geek”. The closest thing I got to contact sports were dance classes and musical theater choreography, and my motto was often, “I can’t, I have rehearsal.” It was my passion. Even if I could play sports, like soccer or softball, I don’t think I would have. I participated in gym classes in elementary school and had a very understanding gym teacher who allowed me to rest when needed. The backlash came from my peers, who often couldn’t understand why they could not sit down and rest while I could. But there were other times when my close friends ran the last length of our mile run right along side me just so I wouldn’t be alone. It was recommended by my teachers and doctors that I be excused from the more rigorous gym class curriculum in middle and high school, but I still remained active, walking, bike riding, swimming and dancing as often as possible. I’ve met many heart patients who are bothered by not being able to participate in contact sports, but I’ve dedicated my extra-curricular time on other activities that are more heart-friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed.\nThe second barrier that has had an effect on my social life is going out and having a good time with friends, which is a big part of most young adult lives. I’ve developed the mentality that I can still do this while not jeopardizing my health. Even in college, I preferred attending a movie night with friends than going to a party and I was thankful to find groups who provided my kind of social events. Even though the decision was easy for me, it was more difficult for some of my peers to understand. I’ve been questioned multiple times by friends, been told that, “I have a family member with a heart defect that drinks a lot, why can’t you?” I’ve been told that friends are concerned that I’m not having a good time because I am not drinking as much as they are. I care too much about my heart, effects on medications, and my health to do that to myself, and I’ve learned that my close friends not only don’t question my personal decision not to drink excessively, but support it wholeheartedly.\nI have been so grateful over the past 13 years to develop a strong family of fellow heart patients. Thanks to Camp Odayin, a camp for kids with heart conditions, where I began as a camper and now remain involved as a volunteer counselor, I have close friends that share my mindset about our barriers as heart patients. We may not be exactly like other young adults, but we still live full and active lives.\nAs a counselor, I’ve continued to enjoy watching campers form these bonds and begin to realize just how important these friendships will be throughout their entire lives. I’ll be attending the Adult Congenital Heart Association’s 8th National Conference for the first time in a couple of months and I’m excited to connect with even more fellow heart patients and p\nDoc 2(Title: \"How CHD Affects One's Social Life - ACHA\") ese bonds and begin to realize just how important these friendships will be throughout their entire lives. I’ll be attending the Adult Congenital Heart Association’s 8th National Conference for the first time in a couple of months and I’m excited to connect with even more fellow heart patients and professionals and adding more members to my “heart family.” The limitations and barriers, in my mind, are all worth it because of all the amazing people I’ve met because of my congenital heart defect.\nTags\nComments\nAdd yours below.\nDisclaimer\nThe opinions expressed by ACHA bloggers and those providing comments on the ACHA Blog are theirs alone, and do not reflect the opinions of the Adult Congenital Heart Association or any employee thereof.

These risk factors increase the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, and stroke.\nThe good news is that lifestyle changes can make a difference. In a study analyzing over 55,000 people, those with favorable lifestyle habits such as not smoking, not being obese, engaging in regular physical activity, and eating a healthy diet lowered their heart disease risk by nearly 50%.\nThe American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recently published guidelines detailing lifestyle and behavioral recommendations to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in those who do not yet have it. The guidelines addressed diet and nutrition, exercise and physical activity, body weight, and tobacco use. They draw from existing evidence that healthier lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of premature death and disability due to heart disease.\nThe ACC/AHA guidelines included specific dietary recommendations such as eating a diet high in vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and fish. They also recommend limiting sodium, saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, sweetened beverages, and processed meats, and omitting trans fats.\nWhat other lifestyle changes can I make to lower my risk of heart disease?\nA healthy lifestyle involves a range of healthy behaviors. One way to think about heart disease risks and corresponding lifestyle changes is the acronym ABCDES:\nAlcohol\nBlood pressure\nCholesterol\nDiabetes\nExercise\nSmoking\nLet's go through each of these elements.\nAvoid alcohol in excess\nWhile the benefit of light to moderate alcohol consumption is somewhat controversial, excessive alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk for death, heart disease, and liver disease. Studies show harm occurs when individuals consume more than 100 grams of alcohol, or about 7 drinks, per week. A standard drink — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits — contains 14 grams of alcohol.\nWhich diet can lower blood pressure?\nFollowing a healthy dietary pattern, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, can help to lower blood pressure. The DASH diet is specifically designed to lower blood pressure. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, legumes, nuts, seeds, and lean meats. These foods are typically high in fiber and low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.\nStudies suggest that the DASH diet can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by about 8 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) by about 4 mm Hg, and reduce mortality.\nHow can I lower cholesterol?\nElevated cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease and is associated with higher risk of death. While genetics play a role, excessive weight, physical inactivity, type 2 diabetes, and excessive alcohol intake also contribute to high cholesterol.\nResearch suggests that reducing saturated fat in the diet and replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat may lower cardiovascular risk. This means replacing butter, coconut oil, palm oil, shortening, or lard with olive, safflower, canola, corn, sesame, soybean, and sunflower oils.\nThe Mediterranean diet has been found to lower cholesterol and reduce CVD risk. This diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, with limited consumption of red meat and sweets. Olive oil is the main source of dietary fat.\nEating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, trout, tuna, herring, and mackerel, also helps to reduce heart disease risk.\nHow can I reduce my risk for diabetes?\nDiabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease. Fortunately, lifestyle changes can help. For example, if you have prediabetes, losing at least 7% of body weight and engaging in 150 minutes or more per week of moderate-intensit\nDoc 4(Title: \"Lifestyle changes to lower heart disease risk - Harvard Health\") s to reduce heart disease risk.\nHow can I reduce my risk for diabetes?\nDiabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease. Fortunately, lifestyle changes can help. For example, if you have prediabetes, losing at least 7% of body weight and engaging in 150 minutes or more per week of moderate-intensity physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes.\nHealthy diets, such as the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, and plant-based diets emphasizing foods higher in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, and lower in glycemic load and saturated fats, are also recommended.\nHow much exercise do I need?\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the US Department of Health and Human Services recommend that all adults ages 18 to 64 engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week — or an equivalent mix of the two. Activities such as brisk walking, running, swimming, biking, and other aerobic exercises are all good options.\nAs a general rule, being active is better than being sedentary. For example, taking at least 4,400 steps daily is associated with lower risk of death than taking only 2,700 steps per day.\nHow bad is smoking for my health?\nSmokers have a higher heart disease risk than never-smokers, and two to three times the risk of death. The more you smoke, the higher your risk of death.\nQuit-smoking medications like varenicline (Chantix) and bupropion (Wellbutrin), and nicotine replacement therapies, are generally safe and can effectively help people quit smoking..\nAbout the Author\nJames Yeh, MD, MPH, Contributor\nDisclaimer:\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

Deep-sea critters have spent millions of years -- some during the time of dinosaurs -- adapting to the deep, dark, isolated ocean. Fish near the surface can't just go down and expect to make a living, especially in the food and energy-starved depths. \"Animals have special niches in the ocean,\" explained Gallo. \"You move deeper, there's going to be less food available.\"\nScientists have only scratched the surface of how the baking seas will hit the swimming life therein. For instance, Gallo pointed out that this study, while detailed, could only look at how warming oceans affected these creatures as adults. Warming waters might very well impact young, vulnerable critters in their early stages of life -- before they even emerge from eggs.\nThe warming is inescapable. It's no wonder some creatures are fleeing.\n\"Marine animals are not getting a reprieve from the heat,\" said Gallo. \"You're just stuck in a warm pool.\"\nTopics Animals\nMark was the science editor at Mashable. After working as a ranger with the National Park Service, he started a reporting career after seeing the extraordinary value in educating people about the happenings on Earth, and beyond.\nHe's descended 2,500 feet into the ocean depths in search of the sixgill shark, ventured into the halls of top R&D laboratories, and interviewed some of the most fascinating scientists in the world.\nDoc 2(Title: \"How climate change affects sea life\") Why sea creatures are fleeing their homes\nThere are 3,800 big thermometers floating in the ocean, and the readings don't lie: Over 90 percent of the warming created by humans is soaked up by the seas. Unsurprisingly, many creatures are feeling the heat.\nIn new research published Wednesday in the journal Nature, scientists found that global warming has forced twice as many marine species than land species to vanish from their hotter habitats --particularly near the already balmy equator. All the species examined were cold-blooded, or ectotherms.\n\"What we found so surprising is that global warming hits sea creatures the hardest,\" said Malin Pinsky, an evolutionary ecologist at Rutgers University and lead author of the research.\nFrom one perspective, it's surprising because it gets so much hotter on land. \"The ocean never gets that hot,\" noted Pinksy. Sea critters, then, aren't adapted to deal with such significant temperature increases. And that's the problem.\n\"That's their Achilles heel,\" said Pinsky.\nAs temperatures warm, especially in the already hot tropics, creatures can't tolerate the heat, and leave. What Pinksy and his team found were local extinctions, meaning over half of the 108 sea creatures they studied left their native homes and moved to cooler waters. Meanwhile about a quarter of land species -- like species of lizards and geckos -- left their homes as things heated up.\nMany of these marine species, forced to flee from warming waters, are not just well-known, they're often food for humans, like halibut and winter founder. \"This affects our dinner plates in many cases,\" said Pinksy.\nAfter pouring through mounds of research on the known temperature limits of marine and animal species, Pinsky and his team also found that sea creatures are more likely to live on the edge of \"dangerously high temperatures.\" In many cases, they don't have a choice.\n\"You don't have anywhere to go,\" said Natalya Gallo, a marine ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography who had no role in the study. \"Maybe you can hide under a kelp leaf, but the entire water around you has warmed.\"\nOn land, at least some animals have other options, especially during record-breaking heat waves. \"They go into shade or a burrow,\" noted Pinksy.\nIt's about time that marine critters -- of which fish provide the main source of animal protein for some 1 billion humans -- receive more attention as the seas soak up Earth's accumulating heat. It's easier to pay attention to the plight of land animals, which certainly need conservation attention, too.\n\"We tend to focus on things in our immediate environment,\" said Kristine Stump, a tropical marine biologist who also had no role in the research. \"We don't spend as much time under the water, and we may not be realizing what's happening [there].\"\nThat makes it challenging to know when species who have been forced to relocate are facing threats to their population. Stump is reminded of the quote by earth scientist John Shepherd: \"Counting fish is just like counting trees -- except that they are invisible and keep moving.\"\nBut as the planet's warming becomes more apparent (18 of the last 19 years have been the warmest on record), perhaps the conditions of sea creatures will receive more attention. \"Ten years ago there was almost no discussion of the [climate] impacts on marine animals,\" said Pinksy. \"Now we're finding they're the most sensitive.\"\nHow sensitive? The spawning migrations of the endangered Nassau grouper, for example, are tightly linked to the water's temperature, said Stump. And when many sharks choose to hunt or rest is strongly temperature-based, she added. In the ocean, where creatures can't escape to a shaded, cooler cave, their migrations, movements, metabolism, and meals are tied to temperature.\n\"You're just stuck in a warm pool.\"\nSea creatures can't simply swim to deeper, colder climes.

The data shows that the global sea level is rising as Earth warms.\nThis is mainly because of two reasons. First, water expands as it gets warmer. So warm water takes up more space in our oceans, and leads to a higher global sea level. Second, melting ice on land flows into the ocean adding water to it. This also causes the sea level to rise.\nLearn more about how we measure sea level.\nDoc 4(Title: \"How Does Climate Change Affect the Ocean ... - NASA ...\") How Are Earth’s Ocean and Climate Connected?\nThe ocean covers about 70% of Earth’s surface. That means it plays a large part in how Earth works. The ocean helps drive Earth’s climate as it takes in and spreads around heat. As Earth’s atmosphere warms, so does the ocean. This causes sea levels to rise. It also impacts plants and animals that live in the ocean.\nWhy is the ocean important for life on Earth?\nThe ocean is important because it is a very large part of our planet. In fact, it covers around 70% of Earth’s surface. The ocean is a home for countless fish, marine mammals, plants, and more. It is also a food source for birds and other animals, including us.\nThe ocean plays an important role in how Earth works. It takes in heat from sunlight and then moves it around the planet. This is linked to Earth’s climate. That’s because temperature helps determine if a place is hot or cold, but temperature also affects if it is rainy or dry. And all of those things are linked to what life survives and thrives in a location.\nHow does the ocean soak up heat?\nWater is excellent at storing heat. Water has a high heat capacity—it absorbs a lot of heat before it begins to get hot. Air, on the other hand, is not so great at storing heat. To compare, the top few meters of the ocean store as much heat as Earth's entire atmosphere.\nAs sunlight comes into Earth, it gets absorbed by the ocean. But sunlight isn’t the same everywhere, because Earth is a sphere. That means that the middle, or tropics, get more direct sunlight than the top and bottom (poles). But the ocean moves the heat around through ocean currents to make it more even. One group of ocean currents that does this is known as the “great ocean conveyor belt.” This is a large driver of Earth’s climate. It can impact weather too, like where it rains.\nHowever, the ocean isn’t just moving heat, it also collects it. As Earth’s atmosphere traps extra heat from an increase in greenhouse gases, all that extra heat has to go somewhere. It turns out that so far, it's the ocean that’s taken in most of it. In fact, the ocean has absorbed around 90% of the extra heat.\nRising ocean temperatures can impact the many plants and animals that live in the ocean. This is similar to how warmer temperatures on land impact plants, animals, and us too.\nDoes the salt in the ocean do anything?\nLike temperature, the amount of salt in the ocean also affects ocean currents. Saltier water is heavier than less-salty water. That means that saltier water will sink below water that’s less salty. The sinking of salty, cold water in certain places helps drive ocean currents and the movement of heat around the planet. These places include the North Atlantic and some areas off the coast of Antarctica.\nPlay \"Go With the Flow\" to use temperature, salinity, and ocean currents to find treasure!\nHow does melting ice impact the ocean?\nAs Earth warms, sea ice and ice on land melt. This could make the water less cold or less salty, and thus less likely to sink. Here is how.\nSea ice reflects sunlight, helping keep the water below it colder. If it melts, then the ocean water below it is exposed and absorbs the heat from sunlight. This warms up the water and causes more sea ice to melt.\nIce on land, like ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, have large amounts of fresh water stored in them. When ice on land melts, the fresh water flows into the ocean and mixes with the salt water. This makes the water less salty.\nWithout the cold, salty water sinking in the North Atlantic and around Antarctica, the ocean currents could slow down. That’s because the sinking water helps drive the currents and the movement of heat around the planet. This could change the climate in places like Europe that currently have milder climates, thanks to the warm currents in the oceans around them.\nHow does a warming ocean impact sea level?\nFor over 30 years, NASA and its partners have measured sea level height with satellites. The data shows that the global\nDoc 5(Title: \"Global Warming Hits Marine Life Hardest - Eos\") One of the best ways to cool down on a hot day is to jump in the ocean. But that doesn’t mean that marine animals have it easy in the face of warming global temperatures. In fact, a new study finds that marine life is more susceptible to extreme heat waves than land-based animals.\n“Animals have ways to cope with extreme heat waves wherever they might live, such as seeking shade or burrowing underground,” says Malin Pinsky, an ecologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., and lead author of the new study, published in Nature. “We were interested in how accessible temperature refugia are to both marine and terrestrial species and how that might affect their susceptibility to high temperatures.”\nThe team calculated the thermal safety margin—the difference between the hottest temperature that an organism can safely tolerate and the hottest body temperature when in the coolest part of their environment—for 88 marine and 299 terrestrial cold-blooded species. They found that marine species are more likely to live near their upper thermal limit than land-based species in part because terrestrial species have more access to thermal refugia such as shade or underground dens.\n“It’s much easier to escape a heat wave on land than in the ocean,” Pinsky says. “It does get cooler the deeper you go, but not all marine life is equipped to dive deeper. Also, many species live on the ocean bottom, and they have nowhere to go.”\nMany major extinctions have hit marine species harder than terrestrial species, including the greatest loss of life, the Permian-Triassic mass extinction around 252 million years ago, when 95% of marine and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct.\n“It’s not strictly a matter of getting too hot,” Pinsky says. “At higher temperatures, an organism’s demand for oxygen goes up, and that likely plays a role in high marine mortality rates as well.”\nOverall, the study found that marine species are moving out of their historical ranges at twice the rate of land-dwelling species.\n“We know that marine species tend to colonize new areas faster than land species. The ocean has fewer barriers to migration than the land,” where species may be limited by terrain features or water availability, says Pinsky.\nThe new study offers a unique look at how organisms are coping with climate change, says Anthony Richardson, a mathematical ecologist at the University of Queensland who penned an accompanying News and Views article in the same issue of Nature. “We used to just say, ‘well as it gets hotter, organisms will all migrate polewards to higher latitudes,’ but as this study shows, it’s not that simple.”\nThe next step will be to expand the thermal safety margin database to include more species. “I’d like to see more biodiversity represented, including invertebrates, mollusks, and warm-blooded animals,” says Richardson.\nPinsky is also interested in how early life stages fare at temperature extremes.\n“Eggs and larvae are often the most sensitive in terms of temperature and oxygen levels,” he says. “Understanding which life stages, species, and ecosystems will be most severely affected by warming will be important for guiding conservation and management efforts as climate change advances.”\n—Mary Caperton Morton (@theblondecoyote), Science Writer\nCitation:\nMorton, M.

Assuredly it hasn’t, but the history of human beings using cash currency does go back a long time – 40,000 years.\nScientists have tracked exchange and trade through the archaeological record, starting in Upper Paleolithic when groups of hunters traded for the best flint weapons and other tools. First, people bartered, making direct deals between two parties of desirable objects.\nMoney came a bit later. Its form has evolved over the millennia – from natural objects to coins to paper to digital versions. But whatever the format, human beings have long used currency as a means of exchange, a method of payment, a standard of value, a store of wealth and a unit of account.\nAs an anthropologist who’s made discoveries of ancient currency in the field, I’m interested in how money evolved in human civilization – and what these archaeological finds can tell us about trade and interaction between far-flung groups.\nWhy do people need currency?\nThere are many theories about the origin of money, in part because money has many functions: It facilitates exchange as a measure of value; it brings diverse societies together by enabling gift-giving and reciprocity; it perpetuates social hierarchies; and finally, it is a medium of state power. It’s hard to accurately date interactions involving currency of various kinds, but evidence suggests they emerged from gift exchanges and debt repayments.\nObjects that occurred rarely in nature and whose circulation could be efficiently controlled emerged as units of value for interactions and exchange. These included shells such as mother-of-pearl that were widely circulated in the Americas and cowry shells that were used in Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia. Native copper, meteorites or native iron, obsidian, amber, beads, copper, gold, silver and lead ingots have variously served as currency. People even used live animals such as cows until relatively recent times as a form of currency.\nThe Mesopotamian shekel – the first known form of currency – emerged nearly 5,000 years ago. The earliest known mints date to 650 and 600 B.C. in Asia Minor, where the elites of Lydia and Ionia used stamped silver and gold coins to pay armies.\nThe discovery of hordes of coins of lead, copper, silver and gold all over the globe suggests that coinage – especially in Europe, Asia and North Africa – was recognized as a medium of commodity money at the beginning of the first millennium A.D. The wide circulation of Roman, Islamic, Indian and Chinese coins points to premodern commerce (1250 B.C. - A.D. 1450).\nCoinage as commodity money owes its success largely to its portability, durability, transportability and inherent value. Additionally, political leaders could control the production of coins – from mining, smelting, minting - as well as their circulation and use. Other forms of wealth and money, such as cows, successfully served pastoral societies, but weren’t easy to transport – and of course were susceptible to ecological disasters.\nMoney soon became an instrument of political control. Taxes could be extracted to support the elite and armies could be raised. However, money could also act as a stabilizing force that fostered nonviolent exchanges of goods, information and services within and between groups.\nThroughout history money has acted as a record, a memory of transactions and interactions. For instance, medieval Europeans widely used tally sticks as evidence for remembering debt.\nFollow the money to see the trade routes\nIn the past, as today, no society was completely self-sustaining, and money allowed people to interact with other groups. People used different forms of currency to mobilize resources, reduce risks and create alliances and friendships in response to specific social and political conditions. The abundance and nearly universal evidence of movement of exotic goods over diverse regions inha\nDoc 2(Title: \"When – and why – did people first start using money?\") e to interact with other groups. People used different forms of currency to mobilize resources, reduce risks and create alliances and friendships in response to specific social and political conditions. The abundance and nearly universal evidence of movement of exotic goods over diverse regions inhabited by people who were independent of each other – from hunter-gatherers to pastoralists, to farmers and city dwellers – points to the significance of currency as a uniting principle. It’s like a common language everyone could speak.\nFor example, Americans who lived in the Early Formative Period dating from 1450 to 500 B.C. used obsidian, mother-of-pearl shell, iron ore and two kinds of pottery as currency to trade across the Americas in one of the earliest examples of a successful global trade. The Maritime Silk Road trade, which occurred between A.D. 700 to 1450, connected Europeans, Asians and Africans in a global trade that was both transformational and foundational.\nIn my own excavation work in 2012, I recovered a 600-year-old Chinese Yongle Tongbao coin at the ancient Kenyan trade port Manda, in the Indian Ocean. Chinese coins were small disks of copper and silver with a hole in the center so they could be worn on a belt. This coin was issued by Emperor Yongle of the Ming Dynasty. He was interested in political and trade missions to the lands beyond the South China Sea and sent Admiral Zheng He to explore those shores, nearly 80 years before Vasco da Gama reached India from Portugal.\nArchaeological discoveries like this one illustrate Africa’s integration into trade interactions in the Indian Ocean. They also show evidence that market economies based on cash money were developing at this time. On the East African coast, there were local merchants and kings of the local Swahili who followed Islam and cultivated these external contacts with other Indian Ocean traders. They wanted to facilitate business dealings, while merchants from the Near East and South Asia had their own Rolodexes of business contacts. Coinage was not just a local affair but also a way of leaving a calling card, a signature and a symbolic token of connections.\nAs the history of money has shown, currency’s impact is double-edged: It enabled the movement of goods and services, migration and settlement amongst strangers. It brought wealth to some, while hastening the development of socioeconomic and other distinctions. The same patterns unfold today with the modern relationship between China and Africa, now more intertwined and unequal than when Admiral Zheng He first brought coins from China in a diplomatic gesture, as a symbolic extension of friendship across the distance separating the two.\nIn our time, possession of cash currency differentiates the rich from the poor, the developed from the developing, the global north from the emerging global south. Money is both personal and impersonal and global inequality today is linked to the formalization of money as a measure of societal well-being and sustainability. Even as currency continues to evolve in our digital age, its uses today would still be familiar to our ancient predecessors.\nDoc 3(Title: \"The History of Money: From Barter to Banknotes - Investopedia\") r), or by eliminating the currency completely.\nMobile Payments\nThe 21st century gave rise to a novel form of payment activated with the touch of your finger. Mobile payments refer to money used to pay for goods and services. They can also be used to transfer money to another individual, such as a family member or friend. This can all be done using a portable electronic device, such as a smartphone or tablet device.\nThis form of payment first came to prominence in Asia and Europe before moving over to North America. From payments via text message, the technology evolved to allow checks to be deposited using the camera app on smart devices.\nMobile payment services like Apple Pay are vying for retailers to accept their platforms for point-of-sale payments. There are also apps dedicated to this method of payment, including Venmo and PayPal.\nVirtual Currency\nVirtual currencies are only available in electronic form. As digital representations of money, this type of currency is stored and traded using computer applications or specially designated software. The appeal of virtual currency is that it offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms do and is operated by decentralized authorities, unlike government-issued currencies.\nBitcoin quickly became the standard for virtual currencies. It was released in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. All of the world's Bitcoin was worth $1.14 trillion as of Aug. 7, 2024.\nKeep in mind, though, that virtual currencies like Bitcoin have no physical coinage because they are traded on exchanges.\nAlthough Bitcoin remains the most popular and most expensive one, other virtual currencies have hit the market. They include Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin.\nHow Long Has Money Been Around, and What Were the First Forms of Value Exchange?\nMoney has been part of human history for at least the past 5,000 years in some form or another. Historians generally agree that a system of bartering was likely used before this time. Bartering involves the direct trade of goods and services. For instance, a farmer may exchange a bushel of wheat for a pair of shoes from a shoemaker.\nWhen and Where Did Coin Minting Begin?\nThe world’s oldest known, securely dated, coin minting site was located at Guanzhuang in the Henan Province of China. The mint began striking spade coins sometime around 640 BCE, likely the first standardized metal coinage.\nWhen Were Coins Replaced by Paper Money?\nThe Chinese moved from coins to paper money around 1260 CE. By the time Marco Polo visited China in approximately 1271 CE, the emperor of China had a good handle on both the money supply and its various denominations.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe history of money is still being written. The system of exchange has moved from swapping animal skins to minting coins to printing paper money, and today, we appear to be on the cusp of a massive shift to electronic transactions.\nAncient transaction forms have been co-opted: for example, bartering still occurs on the margins in some markets such as the business-to-business (B2B) space and some consumer services. The monetary system will surely continue evolving as long as humans require a medium of exchange.\nDoc 4(Title: \"The History of Money: From Barter to Banknotes - Investopedia\") The terms \"money\" and \"currency\" are often used interchangeably. However, several theories suggest they are not identical. According to some theories, money is inherently an intangible concept. Currency, on the other hand, is the physical or tangible manifestation of the intangible concept of money.\nAccording to this theory, money cannot be touched or smelled. Currency is the coin, note, object, or physical representation that is presented in the form of money.\nThe basic form of money is numbers while the basic form of currency is paper banknotes, coins, or plastic cards like credit or debit cards. Though this distinction between money and currency is important in some contexts, for the purposes of this examination of the history of money, the terms are used interchangeably.\nKey Takeaways\n- Money is a medium of exchange with a recognized value that was adopted to make it easier for people to trade products and services with one another.\n- The history of money crisscrosses the world as various cultures recognize the need to simplify trade by introducing a single, portable token of value into the process.\n- People bartered before the world began using money.\n- The world’s oldest known coin minting site was located in China, which began striking spade coins sometime around 640 BCE.\n- Since then, the world has adopted banknotes and moved into digital forms of payment, including virtual currencies.\nWhat Is Money?\nMoney doesn't always have value, whether it's represented by a seashell, a metal coin, a piece of paper, or a string of code mined electronically by a computer. With global wealth estimated to be about $432 trillion at the end of 2023, the value of money depends on the importance that people place on it as a medium of exchange, a unit of measurement, and a storehouse for wealth.\nMoney allows people to trade goods and services indirectly. It helps communicate the price and value of goods and provides individuals with a way to store their wealth. It is valuable as a unit of account—a socially accepted standard by which things are priced and with which payment is accepted. However, both the usage and form of money have evolved throughout history.\nFrom Bartering to Currency\nMoney has been part of human history for at least the past 5,000 years in some form or another. Before that time, historians generally agree that a system of bartering was likely used. Bartering is a direct trade of goods and services.\nFor example, a farmer may exchange a bushel of wheat for a pair of shoes from a shoemaker. However, these arrangements take time.\nIf you exchange an axe as part of an agreement in which the other party is supposed to kill a woolly mammoth, you have to find someone who thinks the tool is a fair trade for having to face down the 12-foot tusks of a mammoth. If this doesn't work, you would have to alter the deal until someone agrees to the terms.\nA type of currency slowly developed over the centuries that involved easily traded items like animal skins, salt, and weapons. These traded goods served as the medium of exchange even though the value of each of these items was still negotiable in many cases. This system of trading spread across the world and still survives today in some parts of the globe.\nOne of the greatest achievements of the introduction of money was the increased speed at which business, whether it involved mammoth slaying or monument-building, could be done.\nIn early August 2021, Chinese archaeologists with the State University of Zhengzhou announced the discovery of the world’s oldest known, securely dated, coin minting site in Guanzhuang in Henan Province, China. A mint is a facility where currency is created. Sometime around 640 BCE, this facility began striking spade coins, one of the first standardized forms of metal coinage.\nFast Fact\nMillions of coins are circulating in the United States. As many as 47,250 coins are minted per minute at the Philadelphia Mint while 40,500 coins are produced per minute by the\nDoc 5(Title: \"Value of Money and the Price Level (With Diagram)\") hine is for the same number of rupees to be spent with greater frequency. This is called increasing the velocity of money.\nThe rupees flow through the economic system faster and this creates a similar effect. Alternatively, if people take money out of savings and spend it, that increases the number of rupees in competition for the available goods. The effect is the same—competition for what is available on the right side will drive prices up.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it appears that people started using money instead of bartering due to the inefficiencies and limitations of the barter system. In bartering, direct trades between two parties are required, and finding a counterparty willing to accept the offered item can be difficult, especially if the items have different values or are not equally desired.

Coming together and sharing a meal is the most communal and binding thing in almost every place in the world. Being able to make a dish and share that with the people you love is one of the most universal concepts because it's at the root of our survival. We all have to eat, and being able to learn how to make a recipe from your mother is one of the oldest traditions of mankind. It feels really good to learn and hone a technique from your parents and pass it down to your kids. This idea of carrying on the legacy and sharing recipes that have been in our family for generations is something that is so incredibly special. My first memories of food are with my Abuela and Mom in the kitchen, learning about our family traditions through dishes that have been passed down and I am so excited to share these with my son.\nFood is also a great vehicle for sharing culture with people from different backgrounds. I lived in New York for a very long time and I remember having dinner parties and big BBQs as a young adult and those were some of the coolest experiences because we would get to taste and share dishes from all over the world. One guest would bring kimchee that their Korean grandmother taught them to make and someone else would bring a Caribbean salad that they grew up eating and so on. Then I would have some braised and grilled meats at the center and we would all share what was in our dishes and how and why we came to know and love them. This is what makes food so special, it is at the center of all cultures and family gatherings.

Food is tied to tradition; food is tied to memories, and many people don’t realize the importance of food as a way to bring people together.\nIn fact, food is so ingrained in our social landscape that it’s hard to imagine any kind of gathering without it. From holidays to a summer barbecue to meeting friends for lunch, to family dinners, food is almost always involved, often serving as the main attraction. Even holidays and key family traditions can center around certain meals and foods. Thanksgiving wouldn’t be the same without turkey, just as Christmas wouldn’t be the same without ham for many families.\nResearchers from the University of Oxford recently found a correlation between how often people eat with others and their life satisfaction. Their results suggest that the more often one eats with others, the more likely they are to feel satisfied and happy with their lives. Socializing is important for one’s physical and mental wellbeing, and social eating plays an important role in bonding with others.\nSocializing with food involved has more pros than cons, including:\n- Instilling a sense of comfort\n- Helping us get out of our comfort zone and trying new things\n- Encouraging a sense of belonging because of common food interests\n- Allowing us to be present and engaged while eating\n- Providing a bonding experience\n- Improving emotional wellbeing\nFood brings people from different cultures together, too.

Not only is much of this rich diet still common in Mexico today, it's spread around the world. Here's a look at some of what the ancient Mexica peoples ate:\nMaize (also called corn or mealies) was the staple grain of the Aztec empire. Maize has been domesticated for thousands of years, and it likely first came into common use in Mexico, spreading to the rest of the world from there. Mexico is still one of the world's top maize growing countries. Corn could be ground into flour and used to make tortillas (a sort of flat bread, sometimes used to wrap a filling to make tacos), tamales and even drinks. Corn has transformed the world perhaps more than any other food. Today it's used not only in food, including candy and of course feeding the cattle that is eaten, it's even used in things like sticky tape and making boxes.\nHow did all this food grow? Find out about Aztec farming here.\nAztec food also included beans and squash. Of course, maize and beans are still a cornerstone of the Mexican diet, a healthy combination especially if you're not eating a lot of meat.\nTo add to these three, the Mexicas (people of the Aztec Empire) ate chillies, tomatoes, limes, cashews, potatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and of course chocolate. The Mexicas domesticated bees for honey, and turkeys for meat and eggs, also dogs and duck. They hunted and fished as well, and used animals such as deer, rabbits, iguana, fish and shrimp for food. Even insects, such as grasshoppers and worms were harvested. These various types of meat made up only a very minor part of the Aztec food that was eaten.\nOne of the greatest gifts to the world from Mexico is chocolate. The cocoa bean was highly treasured in the Aztec Empire. In fact, the bean was used as a currency, as well as Aztec food. Or, in this case, drink.\nThe cocoa beans were used to make a thick chocolate drink, but far different than the hot chocolate we know today. Since they didn't use sugar, the Mexicas added peppers, corn meal and spices. A similar hot drink is still found in Mexico today with corn, known as atole.\nThough Columbus brought cocoa to Europe in the early 1500s, it was mostly ignored. Hernan Cortes was more interested, and substituted sugar and vanilla for the spices. It became a commercial success.\nThe word chocolate even comes from an Aztec/Mayan word chocolatl.\nChocolate actually may have played a part in the fall of the Aztec empire. The Aztecs believed that the god Quetzalcoatl brought the cocoa beans from the tree of life to give to man. Later, the god was banished. It seems that at first the Mexicas believed that Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquerer, was their returning god.\nThere are some excellent recipes available online. Find a low carb Mixiotes recipe here. There's also a recipe for atole. cdkitchen.com has a unique hot chocolate recipe, a combination of Aztec and Spanish traditions.\nFor more Aztec recipes, try a search at cooks.com. Of course, not all of these are real authentic Aztec food, but after reading this article you should have an idea what common elements are in Aztec cooking. For more on traditional Mexican food and what came from the Aztecs, check here. By the way, we know the Aztecs didn't eat chicken, but just for fun here's an Aztec chicken recipe...\nAbove: A Mixiotes dish I ate at Teotihuacan, Mexico.

And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") lly damaging industry, and aside from the fact it makes so many people who consume it sick, dairying affects people in another important way. When we overproduce milk we are being recklessly wasteful of land, water, feed and farmers’ time. Wouldn’t these vital resources be better used in the production of nutritious plant-based foods that are sustainable and essential for optimal health?\nInstead of situating these damaging animal-based industries among poor, underserved communities, often predominantly inhabited by people of color, wouldn’t it be better to grow healthful plant foods that can be made locally available? ‘Food deserts’ is a term commonly used for areas where affordable, healthful food is in short supply, but food justice activists instead talk about ‘food apartheid’, as this issue connects directly to a systemic racism inherent in the food system.\nThere is much that is damaging about the dairy industry, and that is before we even talk about the cows themselves.\nHow Are Cows Treated On Dairy Farms?\nCows are treated as though they are inanimate machinery – you turn on a tap and out comes the milk.\nAs we know, cows produce milk only when they are pregnant, as their breast milk is intended for their babies. Every day that pregnancy is delayed is a day’s loss of milk, and so pregnancy is not left to chance. Cows are artificially inseminated which involves one human hand entering the cow’s anus to manipulate her cervix into position while the other hand inserts a tube of semen into her vagina. Suddenly, milk doesn’t seem quite so wholesome, does it?\nWhen the babies are born, they are taken from their mothers so they don’t actually drink the milk that was made for them. Cows show extreme distress at this separation, often bellowing with grief as any mother would. Cows have been known to break out of farms and trek for miles in search of their calves, such is the strength of their determination and love. And spare a thought for the calves themselves. Newborns need their mothers, and yet they are taken forcibly, and either killed or isolated. Their mothers can only look on and cry out for this to stop but it will happen again and again, as that is the only way to keep the milk flowing.\nIn CAFOs, cows who are naturally grazing animals and have four distinct areas of their stomachs to help them digest grass, are denied access to pasture. They are also denied stimulation, and have nothing to do all day but stand, eat and be milked. And suffer. Standing around is not pain-free when you consider the prevalence of lameness on America’s dairy farms to be up to 55 percent.\nAnd there is an immense biological price to pay for being near-constantly pregnant while simultaneously milked. No wonder, cows break down when still so very young. When they can no longer produce as much milk as is demanded of them, they are trucked to slaughter. It’s not a problem for the farmer, as there are always plenty of female calves who can take the place of their mothers, until they too collapse under the emotional, psychological and physical strain of being a dairy cow.\nIs Dairy Farming Cruel?\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer physically. As well as lameness, there is a high incidence of clinical mastitis – a painful infection of the teats usually caused by bacteria transmitted during the milking process or through living in filthy surroundings. It is so common that it occurs in all dairy herds. Mastitis is extraordinarily painful, and each day, every day, the cows’ infected teats are inserted into machinery to have the milk drawn from them.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer psychologically. Cows are intelligent, sentient beings, with individual personalities, the ability to learn and display long-term memory. They even remember those who have handled them roughly. Cows have needs and desires, but in modern intensive farms they are afforded nothing that makes their lives worthwhile.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer emotion\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that food plays a significant role in bringing cultures together. Food is central to family gatherings and traditions, making it a communal and binding activity across cultures. Sharing meals allows individuals to share their cultural heritage and traditions through specific dishes. Additionally, hosting dinner parties or bringing dishes from one's heritage to a gathering helps in learning about different cultures and histories.

Millions of the self-balancing scooters were sold before reports of batteries overheating and bursting into flames prompted widespread recalls.\nBut it turns out that falls — not fires — were by far the most common cause of injuries.\n\"Hoverboards have a very low center of gravity, increasing the risk of falls,\" Dr. Robert Glatter, emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told CBS News. \"Riding one safely requires a good amount of core strength to maintain your balance. It often looks a lot easier to ride one than it really is.\"\nThe study, published in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from across the country regarding injuries from hoverboards in children and adolescents younger than 18 between 2015 — when they were first introduced to the U.S. market — and 2016. During that time, 26,854 hoverboard injuries were treated in U.S. emergency departments.\nThe highest number of hoverboard injuries occurred in 12-year-old boys. Overall, boys accounted for 52 percent of cases and girls 48 percent.\nThe wrists were the most commonly injured body part, followed by the forearms and the head.\nFractures were the most common diagnosis, accounting for 40 percent of cases, followed by contusions and strains/sprains.\nThe study also tracked the number of injuries involving traditional skateboards. During the same two-year time period, skateboard injuries sent 121,398 kids under age 18 to the E.R. Three-quarters of them were boys.\nMost patients were treated and released, but 3 percent of those suffering hoverboard or skateboard injuries were admitted to the hospital. Head injuries accounted for 14 percent of hospital admissions related to hoverboards and 35 percent of admissions for skateboard injuries.\nWhile the majority of skateboarding injuries occurred on the street, the researchers found most hoverboard injuries occurred at home.\nGlatter, who was not involved in the study, said the risk for injuries is significantly increased when a person is multitasking and therefore distracted while riding a hoverboard.\n\"I continue to see young teens with head and wrist injuries in the E.R., often the result of being distracted by using a smartphone and listening to music while riding a hoverboard,\" he said.\nIn 2016, more than 500,000 hoverboards were recalled after dozens of reports that their lithium-ion batteries had burst into flames. In March 2017, a 2-year-old girl died and two other children were injured in a Pennsylvania house fire that officials said was sparked by a hoverboard battery.\nHowever, the study of 2015-16 incidents identified only three cases of burn injuries in children — none of which were from the toys' malfunctioning batteries.\nIn two instances, kids were burned when they rode a hoverboard in the kitchen and collided with a pot of boiling water. The other suffered a friction burn after a hoverboard ran over the child's finger.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics advises against allowing children under age 16 to operate unlicensed motorized wheeled vehicles. Glatter also says he does not recommend allowing young people to use hoverboards at any age.\n\"My personal feeling is that they are unsafe, and I would advise parents against allowing their teens and children to ride them,\" he said. \"That said, I would advise caution if you do allow your child to ride one. It's essential that they wear an appropriate and well-fitted helmet, as well as wrist guards with padding to reduce the risk for injury.\"\nDoc 2(Title: \"A Brief History of Mattel's Failed Hoverboards\") A Brief History of Mattel's Failed Hoverboards\nOn this 'Back to the Future' day, we revisit Mattel's hoverboard blunders.\nAs you’ve no doubt heard a thousand times today, in the 1989 movie Back to the Future II, Michael J. Fox’s Marty McFly traveled to October 21st, 2015 (Did you know that is today?). He rode a hoverboard and wore a puffy varsity jacket:\nAs popularity of the Back to the Future franchise ballooned, the hoverboard, a neon, flying skateboard-without-wheels that looks like a pastel version of Eddie Van Halen’s guitar, became an object of desire. Toy company Mattel seized on that collective want and made its own “hoverboard” in 1989, the year of Back to the Future II’s release.\nExcept, as we all know now, the toy seemed like cruel joke. Given that the first launch of Mattel’s hoverboard occurred in 1989, actual floatation was never going to happen, but the lack of technology did not prevent Mattel from marketing the product with a shameful level of deceit.\nWatch Mattel’s first Hoverboard commercial to see why:\nWhile the colors were “totally rad,” what Mattel actually produced was a cumbersome looking heap of plastic that appeared to float on TV. It is a technicolor scooter with handlebars only a poser would use. It doesn’t even have wheels, so it makes one wonder how the thing actually moved. It didn’t, of course.\nThe dishonest commercial and the toy it hawked roused a backlash among consumers, and it wasn’t until 2012 that Mattel decided to trot out the hoverboard idea again.\nExcept the rebooted toy landed with a resounding thud in that year, even after a decent amount of press and hype got the sci-fi rank and file all worked up. It didn’t float, either. It does offer speaker that emits a “whooshing” sound effect, which is what the hoverboard might sound like if it was hovering.\nUnsurprisingly, there weren’t many positive reviews of the 2012 hoverboard. In fact, some takes on the toy are scathing.\nBob Gale, Back to the Future’s screenwriter, had supported Mattel’s efforts in 2012, but issued a cutting statement on the product once he actually saw it that year. He wasn’t particularly happy about the hoverboard’s $120 price tag, either.\n“This product, at this price, falls short of the top-notch standards that you and I have come to expect for something that carries the Back To The Future brand,” he writes. “The plastic stand is poorly designed and damn near impossible to make work. And although it was indicated that the board would somehow glide across certain smooth surfaces (like carpet), mine certainly didn’t.”\nThe shade thrown at Mattel, especially from the guy who wrote Back to the Future seems warranted, given that all consumers wanted was something that “will gently glide over most level surfaces,” as the toy’s listing on Mattel’s website boasted.\nThis is kind of funny, given that most efforts to produce an actual, real life hoverboard have proven the task to be nearly impossible and astronomically expensive.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Causes of Poor Service Delivery in Africa and Their Impact ...\") Making sure you're not a bot!\nLoading...\nWhy am I seeing this?\nYou are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites.

Police is meant to enforce the laws of the\nnation and bring peace to the citizen. They decay of the aims for which the\npolice is created and for no acceptable reasons require to be looked into. What\nare those conditions that so surround the police corruption in the country? What\nfactors influence the continuation of police corruption? It is said that police\ncorruption is on the increase not minding all the efforts made to stop\ncorruption or to greatly reduce it.\nAccording to Ortiz and Peterson\n(1994), Police work is often unpleasant. police often have to deal with ugly\nsituations and antisocial behaviour. Police are police are lied to, spit upon\nand sworn at. They see unspeakable atrocities. Because of their shared\nexperiences and unique exposure to their community, many police officers\ndevelop negative characteristics as coping mechanisms.\nWhat actually baffles the people is,\nthe idea that police x-ray corruption within the practice of the law itself for\nexample, Ndubise (1991) emphasized that police hid and delay the file of\nsuspect and bring them out when offered bribe. According to Nkaru (1994) police\npay money to their superior authorities to be posted where they take bribe.\nThis type of action strongly influences bribery and corruption in the police\nforce as a police in the office will be relatively poor when compared with one\nin the field.\nAccording to Wilsom (1968) where\never there is police there is corruption. The government should always look for\nhow to solve the problem. what ever surrounds the police and influences\ncorruption in the nation, one thing is clear that if the view of some people as\nregards police corruption is accepted hook and sink, Nigerians shall not blame\nanybody on police corruption than to do all they can to reduce it. According to\nIsiche and Burn. (1977) police corruption is a vestige of the colonel master.\nBritish police was corrupt when they came into this country. Corrupt messengers\nof Obars, Emirs and Chiefs were the first police group.\nSTATEMENT\nOF THE PROBLEM\nCorruption exists in the country. It includes illegal\nprocedure used by a person or persons in authority to extort money or material\nthings from the public Clinard and Abbott (1973) opined that corruption is\nfound in many countries of Africa and beyond. The police as law enforcement\nunit is made to arrest and prosecute corrupt people for they are criminals. But\non the contrary, the police is involved in corrupt deals. The problems are; who\nthen enforces the law against corruption? What is the effect of police\ncorruption on law enforcement? What is the effect of police corruption on law\nenforcement? Another problem is that police some times take bribe openly at any\nplace they mount check point. When the researcher visited Onitasha by August\n2011, he discovered that from Abakaliki to Onitsha on the express road, there\nwere twenty three check points, At each check point police took money from motorists.\nDrivers gave the money happily to the police provided the police will not look\nat the vehicle documents to know whether the vehicle particulars are current or\nnot. The action is open and not hidden that an observer will feel that bribery\nis legalized in the country of that it is organized from the senior police\nofficers down to the least recruit. By this action, the police field officers\ntake bribe openly without any fear of report to their superior officers. Worse\nstill, why should police take money from drivers at road blocks without fearing\nthat the vehicle could be carrying their superior officers from any police\nuntie in the country.\nPolice are known to demand money\nfrom the public when they go for arrests and even hide criminals file to extort\nmoney.

The\npractice of corruption by the police which is on the increase is a problem\nbecause since they go on unabated, other honest police can be lured into it. It\nappears that corruption is part of the police force dating from the colonial\nmaster the growth of corruption is continuous and steady.

This is why Badejo (2000) opined that after\nthe inauguration of the bill, corruption remained with us as before even to a\nmore worrisome degree.

Further, it will investigate the problematic issues of\npolice corruption in Nigeria with special references to Ebonyi State. Issue of\ncorruption has generally damaged community. Nigeria is currently rated as the\nthird most corrupt nation of the world. According to Salih (2004) international\nputs Nigeria as the second or third most corrupt country in the world. For\nthat, it is taken literally that Nigeria are most corrupt people in the world.\nTherefore, the study will be of immense contribution\nin the attempt to understand problematic issues in the country, more\nparticularly in the police force that is expected to be in their law\nenforcement function. This study will also expose different dimension of police\ncorruption. Finally, this study will make appropriate recommendations on how to\ndrastically reduce corruption in Nigeria generally and police in Nigeria\nparticularly. Theoretically the study will add to the growth of existing\nliterature in areas of police corruption more especially to future researchers\nin the study of public perception on police corruption. The study will make the\npublic to know whether corruption in the police force is the outcome of the\npublic corruption or the police itself.\nOPERATIONALIZATION\nOF CONCEPTS\nIt is an accepted practice in a\nstudy of this kind to define some of the concepts used, so as to make clearer\ntheir meanings.

What people think about the police and their work becomes extremely important and can serve as a significant social indicator of the political health of a society as a whole (Benson, 1981 cited by Andreescu & Keeling, 2010, p.1). The manner in which the stakeholders \"see\" the police can determine the perceived legitimacy of the institution itself, the respect and the citizens’ compliance with the law (Tyler & Huo, 2002), and the quality of their interaction and cooperation with the police as well. The police equally represents a matter of substance and image,\nDoc 4(Title: \"The Consequences Of Police Corruption In The Police Force ...\") ing while on the job in the 1980’s, early 90’s. Per the Criminal Law- Lawyer Source, police corruption is defined as “the abuse of police authority for personal gain or to gain advantage for the police organization. Police corruption can take the form of a variety of criminal activities ranging from actual commission of serious criminal (i.e. drug trafficking and money laundering) to the instances where\nFinally, I would like to look at a podcast called Serial. The first season of Serial follows the murder of a high school senior Hae Min Lee in 1999. After searching for six weeks, her body is found buried in the local park. Her ex-boyfriend, Adnan, is arrested and charged with her murder. However, Sarah Koenig, host of Serial, believes there is something fishy about the case from the start.\nEthics and the Evolution of Police Policing in this present day is defined as an individual or group of individual who prevent and detect crime within a community. Policing compares in many ways. They all attempt to provide services, keep the peace and reduce crime. Policing has evolved into something much more than what it used to be. Within this essay are the many different perspectives and how ethics were learned.\nThe media makes the severity of the situation much worse. In some instances, a situation is represented in way that conveys a case as deceptive. Police misconduct, in this situation, is preposterously distorted. For example, the scene one sees on television may be completely inaccurate. In the article Unpacking Public Attitudes to the Police: Contrasting Perceptions of Misconduct with Traditional Measures of Satisfaction, Miller states, “…research found that people's fear of crime was related to crime content in the newspapers they read…”( 6).\nBrianna Marquez English III - 5th period May 22, 2018 Being bad & getting exposed Police brutality and the system being corrupt has always been an issue in America, but lately it’s been brought up more and more in the media. The system hasn 't always revealed the full truth about stories, but now with technology it has become a concern that the police are covering up things that we should know. Recently there have been more protests and riots about officers not doing their jobs and they are going out of there way to hurt victims.\nIt is easy to learn about a subject from a book, but it is an entirely different matter to learn about a subject through real life experience. I hope to learn how to serve and protect while implementing the law correctly, especially in today’s world when the level of support for police officers is very low and the level of misconduct cases concerning the police are very high. It is not easy to know what to do in every situation, especially when some reactions are needed with very little or no time to think about. It is one thing to hear about a crime happening and the response that would be best to give, and another thing to need\nA career in policing requires an individual to meet a high standard for character and demonstrated behavior, in order to be developed into an effective officer. Succeeding in a police academy requires the candidate to display and apply integrity, a skill which must be developed before receiving admission. Integrity demonstrated through a police officer’s personal life, provides the foundation for a respected career. When presented with the opportunity to leverage a peace officer’s position for personal profit, an individual who has previously made selfless choices, is more reliable for operating within the law. Integrity as a term has the social implication of following ones beliefs, regardless of the opposition.\nPolice officers should take integrity rests from time to time; this would test if the officer will make honest choices when faced by a situation. This tests would lead to opening of investigations and uprooting corrupt and dishonest officers. Internal affairs model- this would help reduce corruption by investigating the officers\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Consequences Of Police Corruption In The Police Force ...\") One primary legislative cause of the difficulties in prosecuting police is the 1986 the United States supreme courts case, Tennessee v. Garner, which did not allows usages of deadly force by an officer unless \"the officer has a good-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others\" but the rhetorically vague term \"good-faith belief\" allowed an objective reason to kill and created a barrier in proving an officer is guilty in court system. While this old legislative piece accounts the difficulties in prosecuting police, the traditional unspoken rule of police officers not to report against colleagues cause corruption in the process of prosecution which is another source of\nare pay, accountability, and lax management. You may be wondering how does pay or salary lead to corruption of a police department, the answer is simple. Police officers don’t make a lot of money, so when Death Row Records offered some of L.A.P.D. officers an off-duty security job, some jumped at the opportunity. I believe that some of the officers didn’t intend to be corrupt but slowly let the extra money get to them. The second thing that led to corruption was the lack of accountability.\n“Frequent exposure to media reports of police abuse or corruption is a strong predictor of perceptions of misconduct and supports the belief that is common.” (France-Respers 1).

The border city of Mission is a hot spot for drug traffickers and has become an area of concern for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, also known as HIDTA, since the 1990s.

Costs generated by unemployment are considered dead losses as they do not create any gains or benefits.\nAt the individual level, unemployment has both immediate and long-term effects. In the short term, an unemployed individual faces a diminished standard of living due to a reduction or elimination of income. In the long term, individuals may also lose professional skills and suffer negative effects to both mental and physical health.\nProlonged unemployment can also cause a rise in protectionist and anti-immigration tendencies in society. A shift towards protectionist tendencies can result in a damaged or hampered economy. High rates of unemployment have also been observed to correlate with a rise in crime rates and lowered volunteerism. Individuals who have been unemployed for long periods of time may choose to engage in criminal activities to either fulfill financial needs or combat boredom.\nUnemployment generally generates a financial cost to the country, as governments are forced to distribute higher amounts of unemployment benefits or food assistance. While the country’s expenditure increases, its income also drops as it can no longer collect the same level of income tax, due to less of the population being employed.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Why Is Unemployment A Economic Problem? - Blurtit\") Wow crime no offense...that's not correct. When people don't have a job they don't buy things and when they don't buy things businesses don't do so well and when businesses don't do well they have to in turn lay off more people which starts the process all over again. Also, people can't afford to pay bills so other companies aren't making money there as well. It's like one big circle. Then when businesses aren't doing so well they have less money to pour into our economy and our government can't tax as much leading to a shortage of gold toilet seats they can buy...that one was a joke. But you see where I am coming from. If people do not have money the businesses don't have money and if the businesses and people don't have money the government doesn't have money. That's the easiest way to look at it.\nThe main impact unemployment has on society and the economy is the productive power that it withholds - i.e. Any person who is unemployed could be doing something productive and thus contributing to the economy as a whole.\nBecause crime generally comes from the loss of employment which unfortunately marks the society for greater crimes taking place. When unemployment is on the rise in any State, Country and/or Locale it generally places families in a hardship situation that causes them to seek other methods of survival that are normally not their usual way(s) of life. Therefore, unfortunately crime normally takes place, which causes the Economy to suffer because so many people, consumers, businesses, environments will suffer due to the high rise in crime that normally comes from long-term unemployment.\nThe only impact unemployment can make in any economy is to drag the country down\nWhen the unemployment rate goes up, the economy is in effect throwing away the goods and services that the unemployed workers could have produced. During recessions, it is as if vast quantities of automobiles, clothing, and other commodities were simply dumped into the ocean.\nHow much waste results from high unemployment? What is the opportunity cost of recession? A survey provides a calculation of how far output fell short of potential gross domestic product during the major periods of high unemployment over the last half-century. The largest economic loss occurred during the Great Depression, but the oil and inflation crises of the 1970s and 1980s also generated more than a trillion dollars of lost output. The last decade has been one of unprecedented stability in the United States, with very small business cycle losses.\nThe economic losses during periods of high unemployment are the greatest documented wastes in a modern economy. There are many times larger than the estimated inefficiencies from microeconomic waste due to monopoly or than the waste induced by tariffs and quotas. I think this answer will satisfy your question.\nHow much waste results from high unemployment? What is the opportunity cost of recession?

Approval? Indeed, not!\nThe other scheme requires that all business ventures be compelled to adopt the “profit-sharing” procedure — employees as well as entrepreneurs sharing in the gains.\nThis is inspired by some remarkable successes such as Lincoln Electric of Cleveland. The assumption is that if Jim Lincoln could, by this arrangement, earn a great deal for himself, pay higher wages than others, and undersell all of his competitors, so could everyone else — hundreds of thousands of businessmen from hamburger stand owners to General Motors. Simply pass a law and make every entrepreneur operate like Mr. Lincoln!\nOverlooked is the fact that only one Jim Lincoln ever existed. There are no two entrepreneurs who operate their businesses alike, nor could they do so if they tried. Each is novel to some extent; and consumers—that’s all of us—are thus advantaged.\nAny profit-sharing arrangement should, in all fairness, be also a loss-sharing arrangement. But most wage earners would shy away from any employer who required employees to share any losses his business might incur. Why? Tens of thousands of businesses fail annually, as everyone knows.\nWere profit-sharing made compulsory for everyone, production would dramatically decline, just as in the first scheme. There would be other results, no less disastrous.\nOut-producing inflation or fulfilling contracts at a constant purchasing power or forcing every business to engage in profit-sharing are no more than “pipe dreams!’ Adoption need not be feared. These schemes merely illustrate how people avoid pinpointing the cause of inflation and, thus, propose remedies which compound the problem.\nPrice Control and Rationing\nHowever, what do we find in the clay-to-day world of “practical” politics? The worst of all possible schemes: price control and rationing as edicts by the Federal government and wage controls in the hands of labor unions. Below-market prices and above-market wages! Inflation is not questioned; we have instead only futile attempts to escape the effects, which make the effects increasingly disastrous. In what way? Production is both diminished and distorted. Figuring out how to out-scheme the political schemers Lakes the place of discovering how best to satisfy consumer preferences. Schemers with political and coercive power make schemers of every one of us they overpower.\nTo illustrate: By reason of governmental intervention, the supply)f gas and oil is curbed and the demand increased. What to do? Ration the fuel! To the station attendant say, “Fill’er up.” “Sorry, only $3 worth to a person.” So the car owner takes what he can get and goes to another station repeating, “Fill’er up.” Gas wasted going from station to station! Eventually, all the gas is gone, but consumers still have “gas money” burning holes in their pockets. The best way to ration gas or any other scarce resource is to let the price rise to a point where the supply is sufficient to meet the demand.\nWe need only come to our senses to stop inflation; nothing is required beyond discovering its cause and then being rid of it. The cause? Over-extended government. To repeat what many of us have written over and over again: when the costs of government rise beyond the point where it is no longer politically expedient to defray the costs by direct tax levies, governments all over the world resort to an expansion of paper money — inflation — as a means of making up the difference. Inflation dilutes and depreciates the medium of exchange as a means of siphoning private property into the coffers of government) Here we have the cause, so simple to see through. But being rid of the cause is not simple. Why the difficulty?\nThe difficulty is rooted in an unintelligent interpretation of self-interest. Today, all of us without exception are feeding more or less at the Federal trough. True, there are a few who are force-fed, not dipping into the trough willingly. Finding it nece\nDoc 4(Title: \"Methods to Control Inflation - Economics Help\") demand. If economic growth is rapid, reducing the growth of AD can reduce inflationary pressures without causing a recession.\nAlso increasing taxes to reduce inflation is likely to be politically unpopular which is why fiscal policy is rarely used to reduce inflation.\nOther Policies to Reduce Inflation\n1. Reduce expectations\nA key determinant of inflation over time is inflation expectations. If people expect inflation next year, firms will put up prices and workers will demand higher wages. This expectation tends to cause higher inflation. If the Central Bank and government can effectively reduce expectations by making credible threats to bring inflation under control, this will make their job easier.\n2. Price controls\nWith inflation, we will see firms trying to increase prices as much as they can to maintain profitability and deal with rising costs. One way to try to avoid this ‘profit-push’ inflation is to introduce price controls. This is where the government sets limits on price increases.\nFor example, in 1971 President Nixon imposed a price freeze that he reintroduced in 1973 after winning the election. The price freezes were politically popular for a short time but basically failed. Firms restricted supply and when price freezes ended, suppressed inflation returned with a vengeance. However, it is worth noting that price controls during wartime were successful in reducing inflation. One study by Paul Evans found in WWII price controls were successful in keeping prices 30% lower than otherwise. (though this was with rationing and 7% lower output).\n3. Wage Control\nIf inflation is caused by wage inflation (e.g. powerful unions bargaining for higher real wages), then limiting wage growth can help to moderate inflation. Lower wage growth will reduce the costs for firms and lead to less excess demand in the economy.\nHowever, as the UK discovered in the 1970s, it can be difficult to control inflation through income policies, especially if the unions are powerful. Also, wage control requires widespread co-operation in the economy, but if firms are facing labour shortages they will be more concerned to get the workers, even if they have to exceed government wage controls.\n4. Monetarism\nMonetarism seeks to control inflation by controlling the money supply. Monetarists believe there is a strong link between the money supply and inflation. If you can control the growth of the money supply, then you should be able to bring inflation under control. Monetarists would stress policies such as:\n- Higher interest rates (tightening monetary policy)\n- Reducing budget deficit (deflationary fiscal policy)\n- Control of money being created by the government\nHowever, in practice, the link between money supply and inflation is less strong.\n5. Supply-Side Policies\nOften inflation is caused by persistent uncompetitiveness and rising costs. Supply-side policies may enable the economy to become more competitive and help to moderate inflationary pressures. For example, more flexible labour markets may help reduce inflationary pressure.\nHowever, supply-side policies can take a long time, and cannot deal with inflation caused by rising demand.\n6. Exchange rate policy\nA country may seek to keep inflation low by joining a fixed exchange rate mechanism. The argument is that if the value of a currency is fixed (or semi-fixed) then this creates a discipline to keep inflation low. If inflation rises, the currency would become uncompetitive and start to fall. In the late 1980s, the UK joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) partly to bring inflation under control. However, targetting inflation through the exchange rate can is difficult and the UK was forced to leave the ERM in 1992.\n6. Ways to Reduce Hyperinflation – change currency\nIn a period of hyperinflation, conventional policies may be unsuitable. Expectations of future inflation may be hard to change. When people have lost confidence in a currency, it may be necessary to introduce a new curren\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Effects of Unemployment on Society and the Economy\") Unemployment means being out of a job or in a situation where the individual is willing to work but has none.\nThe effects of unemployment on society and economy are far-reaching and can have a significant impact on individuals, families, and communities. Unemployment can lead to financial hardship, social isolation, and mental health problems. It can also strain relationships, increase crime rates, and lead to political instability.\nThis article brings and discusses the main issues/effects of unemployment on our society and economy.\nThe Cost of Unemployment – Economic\nSome of the well-known effects of unemployment on the economy are:\n1.) Unemployment financial costs\nThe government and the nation suffer. In many countries, the government has to pay the unemployed some benefits.\nThe greater the number of the unemployed or the longer they are without work, the more money the government has to shell out. Therefore, the nation not only has to deal with the lost income and decreased production but also with additional costs.\n2.) Spending power\nThe spending power of an unemployed person and his/her family decreases drastically, and they would rather save than spend their money, which, in turn, affects the economy adversely.\n3.) Reduced spending power of the employed\nIncreased taxes and the insecurity about their own work may affect the spending power of the working people as well, and they too may start to spend less than before, thus affecting the economy and also the society in a negative manner.\n4.) Recession\nWith the increase rates of unemployment, other economic factors are significantly affected, such as the income per person, health costs, quality of health care, standard of living, and poverty.\nAll these affects not just the economy but the entire systems and society in general.\nThe effect of unemployment on our society\nUnemployment affects not just the person himself but also his/her family and, in the long run, the society where he lives.\nUnemployment brings with it despair, unhappiness, and anguish. It forces people to live their lives in a way they do not wish to – life expectancy is negatively affected.\nLife expectancy is the ease by which people living in a time/place are able to satisfy their needs/wants. Here are the main aspects:\n1. Mental health: Mental health problems like low self-confidence, feeling unworthy, depression, and hopelessness.\nWith the lost income and the frustration involved in it, the recently unemployed may develop negative attitudes toward common things in life and may feel that all sense of purpose is lost. Frequent emotions could be low self-esteem, inadequateness, and feeling dejected and hopeless.\n2. Health diseases: The overall tension of unemployment can increase dramatically general health issues of individuals.\n3. Tension at home: Quarrels and arguments at home front which may lead to tension and increased numbers of divorces, etc.\n4. Political issues: Loss of trust in the administration and the government which may lead to political instability.\n5. Tension over taxes rise: Unemployment also brings discontent and frustration amongst the tax-paying citizens. In order to meet the demands of the unemployment fund, the government many times may have to increase taxes, thus giving way to restlessness amongst the tax-paying citizens.\n6. Insecurity amongst employees: The prevailing unemployment and the plight of the unemployed people and their families may create fear and insecurity even in the currently employed people.\n7. Crime and violence: Increase in the rate of crime.\n8. Suicide cases: Increase in the rate of suicide attempts and actual suicides as well.\n9. Social outing: Unemployment may bring a decrease in social outings and interactions with other people, including friends.\n10. Stigma: Unemployment brings more than just ‘no work’. It also brings with it the disgrace that the person has to bear. Nobody likes to be termed as unemployed.\n11.

From the far-right demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, with their “Blood and Soil” chants and their “Jews will not replace us” placards to attacks on synagogues in Sweden, arson attacks on kosher restaurants in France and a spike in hate crimes against Jews in the UK. Antisemitism seems to have been given a new lease of life.\nThe seemingly endless conflicts in the Middle East have made the problem worse as they spawn divisive domestic politics in the West. But can the advance of antisemitism be attributed to the rise of right-wing populism or the influence of Islamic fundamentalism? One thing is clear. Antisemitism is here and it’s getting worse.\nAntisemitism rears its ugly head in every aspect of public life, whether internal debates within political parties or accusations of conspiratorial networks or plots in politics and business. Or even in the accusations that Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein’s sexually predatory behaviour was somehow linked to his Jewish origins.\nBut by focusing narrowly on the contemporary context of modern antisemitism, we miss a central, if deeply depressing, reality. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic magazine, puts it correctly when he says that what we are seeing is an ancient and deeply embedded hostility towards Jews that is reemerging as the barbarous events of World War II recede from our collective memory.\nGoldberg says that for 70 years, in the shadow of the death camps, antisemitism was culturally, politically and intellectually unacceptable. But now “we are witnessing … the denouement of an unusual epoch in European life, the age of the post-Holocaust Jewish dispensation”. Without an understanding of antisemitism’s ancient roots, the dark significance of this current trend may not be fully understood and hatred may sway popular opinion unchallenged.\nAntisemitism has been called history’s oldest hatred and it has shown itself to be remarkably adaptable. It is carved from – and sustained by – powerful precedents and inherited stereotypes. But it also taking on variant forms to reflect the contingent fears and anxieties of an ever-changing world. Understood this way, it is the modern manifestation of an ancient prejudice – one which some scholars believe stretches back to antiquity and medieval times.\nAncient tradition of hatred\nThe word “antisemitism” was popularised by the German journalist Wilhelm Marr. His polemic, Der Sieg des Judentums über das Germentum (The Victory of Jewry over Germandom), was published in 1879. Outwardly, Marr was a thoroughly secular man of the modern world. He explicitly rejected the groundless but ancient Christian allegations long made against the Jews, such as deicide or that Jews engaged in the ritual murder of Christian children. Instead, he drew on the fashionable theories of the French academic Ernest Renan (who viewed history as a world-shaping contest between Jewish Semites and Aryan Indo-Europeans). Marr suggested that the Jewish threat to Germany was racial. He said that it was born of their immutable and destructive nature, their “tribal peculiarities” and “alien essence”.\nAntisemites like Marr strove for intellectual respectability by denying any connection between their own modern, secular ideology and the irrational, superstitious bigotry of the past. It is a tactic which is employed by some contemporary antisemites who align themselves with “anti-Zionism”, an ideology whose precise definition consequently excites considerable controversy. But this continuing hostility towards Jews from pre-modern to modern times has been manifest to many.\nThe American historian Joshua Trachtenberg, writing during World War II, noted:\nModern so-called ‘scientific’ antisemitism is not an invention of Hitler’s … it has flourished primarily in central and eastern Europe, where medieval ideas and conditions have persisted until this day, and where the medieval conception of the Jew which underlies the prevailing emotional\nDoc 3(Title: \"How Gender Stereotypes of Emotion Harm Women Leaders ...\") G.

From the far-right demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, with their “Blood and Soil” chants and their “Jews will not replace us” placards to attacks on synagogues in Sweden, arson attacks on kosher restaurants in France and a spike in hate crimes against Jews in the UK. Antisemitism seems to have been given a new lease of life.\nThe seemingly endless conflicts in the Middle East have made the problem worse as they spawn divisive domestic politics in the West. But can the advance of antisemitism be attributed to the rise of right-wing populism or the influence of Islamic fundamentalism? One thing is clear. Antisemitism is here and it’s getting worse.\nAntisemitism rears its ugly head in every aspect of public life, whether internal debates within political parties or accusations of conspiratorial networks or plots in politics and business. Or even in the accusations that Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein’s sexually predatory behaviour was somehow linked to his Jewish origins.\nBut by focusing narrowly on the contemporary context of modern antisemitism, we miss a central, if deeply depressing, reality. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic magazine, puts it correctly when he says that what we are seeing is an ancient and deeply embedded hostility towards Jews that is reemerging as the barbarous events of World War II recede from our collective memory.\nGoldberg says that for 70 years, in the shadow of the death camps, antisemitism was culturally, politically and intellectually unacceptable. But now “we are witnessing … the denouement of an unusual epoch in European life, the age of the post-Holocaust Jewish dispensation”. Without an understanding of antisemitism’s ancient roots, the dark significance of this current trend may not be fully understood and hatred may sway popular opinion unchallenged.\nAntisemitism has been called history’s oldest hatred and it has shown itself to be remarkably adaptable. It is carved from – and sustained by – powerful precedents and inherited stereotypes. But it also taking on variant forms to reflect the contingent fears and anxieties of an ever-changing world. Understood this way, it is the modern manifestation of an ancient prejudice – one which some scholars believe stretches back to antiquity and medieval times.\nAncient tradition of hatred\nThe word “antisemitism” was popularised by the German journalist Wilhelm Marr. His polemic, Der Sieg des Judentums über das Germentum (The Victory of Jewry over Germandom), was published in 1879. Outwardly, Marr was a thoroughly secular man of the modern world. He explicitly rejected the groundless but ancient Christian allegations long made against the Jews, such as deicide or that Jews engaged in the ritual murder of Christian children. Instead, he drew on the fashionable theories of the French academic Ernest Renan (who viewed history as a world-shaping contest between Jewish Semites and Aryan Indo-Europeans). Marr suggested that the Jewish threat to Germany was racial. He said that it was born of their immutable and destructive nature, their “tribal peculiarities” and “alien essence”.\nAntisemites like Marr strove for intellectual respectability by denying any connection between their own modern, secular ideology and the irrational, superstitious bigotry of the past. It is a tactic which is employed by some contemporary antisemites who align themselves with “anti-Zionism”, an ideology whose precise definition consequently excites considerable controversy. But this continuing hostility towards Jews from pre-modern to modern times has been manifest to many.\nThe American historian Joshua Trachtenberg, writing during World War II, noted:\nModern so-called ‘scientific’ antisemitism is not an invention of Hitler’s … it has flourished primarily in central and eastern Europe, where medieval ideas and conditions have persisted until this day, and where the medieval conception of the Jew which underlies the prevailing emotional\nDoc 3(Title: \"How Gender Stereotypes of Emotion Harm Women Leaders ...\") G.

Older people are attractive, as long as their facial expressions communicate life's wisdom, kindness and warmth of character. Remember that an attractive appearance is also the way in which we convey information about ourselves to others, it is not just clothes, accessories, but also our attitude, our behaviour that makes us more attractive for others\" - emphasises Dr. Czernecka.\nQualitative research was conducted among residents of a large city (over 500,000 residents) with secondary and higher education, with a similar economic status. The study was financed by the National Science Centre.\nPAP - Science in Poland\nszu/ ekr/ kap/\ntr. RL\nDoc 3(Title: \"How women’s life-long experiences of being judged by their ...\") ir life experiences have routinely included instances of being looked at.\nEvery time a girl is told she is cute or pretty, or even described in gender-neutral, objective terms such as being tall, she is actually being told she is being looked at and assessed on her appearance. Boys are far more likely to have their behaviour or personality commented on by adults, rather than their appearance - being brave, adventurous or clever.\nEven more insidious is the notion that appearance evaluations genuinely matter in numerous situations. The benefits that attractive women receive include everything from social mobility and college admissions to educational attainment and job offers. Women rated as being unattractive or unfeminine are more negatively evaluated than comparably unattractive men.\nBetter office designs\nGiven that women’s outcomes are, at least in part, determined by their appearance, it is not surprising that, compared to their male colleagues, female workers are comparatively more aware of their visibility.\nResearch suggests we should question the notion that, just because we can see and hear our colleagues, we will have more and better in-person conversations. The communication benefits of increased exposure to others afforded by open-plan space may be overstated, and the downside of being so visible may disproportionately impact women in the workplace.\nThe idea that female and male employees differ in their perceptions of being observed should be acknowledged and incorporated into office design.\nHow? By ensuring that, within open-plan environments, female workers are afforded opportunities for privacy. This includes allowing them to work with their backs to the wall or to be seated away from busy thoroughfares, and by positioning desks so that women are not forced to walk past numerous colleagues on their way to amenities such as the kitchen or the bathroom.\nOr, best of all, allowing people to work remotely (and in total privacy) for at least part of the week.\nDoc 4(Title: \"5 Things Women Are Judged More Harshly For Than Men\") When it comes to gender, double standards are alive and well. Let's face it: despite all of the advances toward gender equality, many people still expect different things from men and women.\nThis is why studies about female breadwinners or advertisements featuring stay-at-home dads are newsworthy, why \"boys will be boys\" is actually still a phrase humans use, and why it's standard for men to catcall women on the street and not vice-versa. These inequalities arguably exist because it's common for people to judge mens' and women's behavior by different standards.\nRedditor blackbirdholiday asked other Reddit users to identify some of the things women are generally judged more harshly for than men.The results made us realize just how much has to change.\nHere are five things Reddit users believe society looks down on women for:\n1. Having \"too many\" sexual partners. While no-one's \"number\" should matter, the sexual double standard is alive and well. Men who sleep around are \"studs,\" but women who do the same are \"sluts.\" What's more, a disturbing study found that women labelled \"promiscuous\" were rejected by their male and female peers, which is all kinds of messed up.\n2. Having a messy home. Though an estimated 81 percent of men and 87 percent of women report feeling anxious about home upkeep, women still do the majority of the housework. Why? Because women are judged much more harshly than men for having a messy home. We like the attitude HuffPost blogger Claire McCarthy shared in her Feb. 25 post: \"We have more important things to do. If there is some time left over after we talk, eat together, play together and finish this really great book, we'll clean. If not, well, it can wait.\"\n3. Being overweight. Though both men and women experience fat prejudice, studies have found that overweight women feel more societal pressure to lose weight than overweight men.\n4. Being blunt or assertive. A woman who speaks her mind too much is deemed bossy, aggressive or arrogant -- whereas a mouthy dude is simply showcasing his executive leadership skills.\n5. Not having children. Childfree women are often referred to as \"selfish\" and told they will regret their decision not to have kids. Because what kind of unnatural woman would never want to be a mother? Men get no such flak -- being a dad isn't considered to be an essential part of manhood. Plus, men have way more time to decide if they want kids! (But they still have biological clocks, too.)\nWhat else do you think women are judged more harshly for? Leave a comment below, or Tweet @HuffPostWomen!\nDoc 5(Title: \"Sociologist: Women judged more by their looks in various ...\") Studies show that while both women and men are aware of the importance of appearance for social functioning, women are judged more by their looks than men in various spheres of life, says sociologist Dr. Julita Czernecka from the University of Lodz.\nThe researcher is a co-author of the book \"Kulturowe koncepcje płci i wieku a postawy kobiet i mężczyzn wobec swego zdrowia i wyglądu\" (\"Cultural concepts of gender and age and the attitudes of women and men towards their health and appearance\"). The publication is based on research carried out at the Institute of Sociology of the University of Lodz by a team of researchers: Ewa Malinowska, Krystyna Dzwonkowska-Godula, Emilia Garncarek, Julita Czernecka and Joanna Brzezińska.\nDr. Czernecka emphasises that at the first impression, facial expressions, gestures, postures, attire, accessories and hairstyle often tell more about a person than verbal messages.\nMany studies on the importance of appearance have been published. Among the more interesting concepts is Catherine Hakim's concept of erotic capital that includes such elements as: the beauty of the face and its symmetry, sexual attractiveness in the context of the whole body, charm and grace, positive energy, as well as dressing style, makeup and hairstyle.\n\"According to this concept, attractive people are those whom others like not only because of their appearance, but also their behaviour; they are sociable, nice, friendly, likeable. As a result, they are generally considered more competent, reliable, it is easier for them to find friends, they are promoted more often and earn more\" - the sociologist explains. Other studies also show that the value of beauty in the labour market and in personal life often overshadows intelligence, education, academic titles, class affiliation or diligence.\nSociologists from the University of Lodz conducted research on attractiveness among women and men in three age categories: young people (20-37 years old); middle-aged (38-62 years old); and elderly (63-80 years old).\nAccording to Dr. Czernecka, both women and men of different ages were aware of the impact of their appearance on their social functioning. Everyone noticed not only the instrumental value of the appearance, but also its autotelic value - the impact of appearance on well-being, self-esteem and confidence.\nResearch shows, however, that the attitudes towards appearance vary between age and sex groups. Women more often notice that they are judged by their appearance in various spheres of life more than men. Young people, regardless of gender, have the highest awareness of the importance of appearance. \"Feminisation of appearance\" can also be observed among young men.\n\"In this age category, caring about appearance and physical attractiveness is no longer a women's domain. But young women still more often and more strongly emphasise that in their case appearance is more important than in the case of men, especially when it comes to professional career\" - notes the researcher.\nMiddle-aged women and men emphasise the importance of appearance especially in the context of personal life and intimate relationships. This is associated with the fact that people in this category enter the so-called secondary matrimonial market.\n\"Middle-aged women emphasize that their appearance is more often evaluated than the appearance of men, which is why they try to maintain a young look. In the case of men, age is not a factor that could disqualify them in any area, including appearance\" - Czernecka says.\nThe biggest differences in opinions about appearance occur in the oldest age group (63-80). According to the sociologist, older men mostly ignore the role of appearance. Women in this group, on the other hand, think that they are judged mainly by their looks.\n\"They have strongly internalised standards of being young and attractive - they express the conviction that in the case of older women, the lack of attractiveness contributes to being +invisible+\" - s\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, women are judged more by their appearance due to several factors:\n\n1. **Social Expectations**: Societal norms often place greater emphasis on physical attractiveness for women compared to men.

However, the problem of racial inequality extends far beyond policing. Racial inequality has a deep history in the US and despite the struggles in the Civil Rights Era that resulted in (mostly) legal equality, there is still vast inequality between Black and white citizens in practice.\nIt is hard to overstate just how clear the evidence is for the claim that racial inequality is an ongoing problem in the United States. While there is probably a handful of people who would deny this reality, most people across the political spectrum agree that there is racial inequality. Where people disagree is on the question of why there is racial inequality. There are essentially two competing narratives: 1) “Racial inequality is caused by historical and ongoing discrimination,” or 2) “Racial inequality is due to differences in choices, culture, and/or values.” The former narrative emphasizes that the Black community has been (and continues to be) held back by racism on an individual and systemic basis. The latter narrative emphasizes the legal equality that Blacks and whites share and thus attributes disparities to differences across individuals in each group.\nWhich of these narratives one endorses is highly correlated with their demographic group. Conservatives (compared to liberals), are more likely to adopt the latter narrative. In other words, they are much less likely to agree that discrimination is the main reason Black people can’t get ahead. Similarly, whites (compared to Black Americans), are much less likely to cite discrimination, lower quality schools, and lack of jobs as the causes of inequality. The polls cited above also show there are similar racial and ideological splits on perceptions of the Black Lives Matter movement. Beyond this polling data, you can find plenty of examples of these narratives emerging out of their respective demographic camps.\nIn the conservative magazine National Review, attorney Peter Kirsanow argues that “individual behavior, family structure, perverse governmental policies, and culture” are largely ignored when discussing racial inequality. He also claims that “systemic, structural, or institutional racism” are over-emphasized by liberals in a politically convenient ploy. Popular conservative commentator Ben Shapiro echoed this perspective here saying racial inequality, “has nothing to do with race, and everything to do with culture.”\nThe alternative narrative, that racial inequality is caused by historical and ongoing discrimination, is actually quite widespread in the news media even within outlets that are somewhat “down the middle”. For example, this USA Today article connects disparities in police violence and coronavirus deaths to systemic racism. The author argues that aspects of racial inequality are “intimately connected” and points to a legacy of discrimination as the cause of current housing disparities between white people and Black people. For a more liberal example, this Mashable article succinctly claims that systemic racism “is everywhere” and also links it to racial disparities related COVID-19 and high profile policing deaths.\nExperimental research\nThe statistics about racial inequality are basically correlations. Being Black is correlated with a variety of disadvantages; being white is correlated with a variety of advantages. So how can we understand what causes these advantages and disadvantages? Well, how do scientists typically establish causation? The best tool scientists have to determine cause and effect is the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). In an RCT, researchers randomly assign participants to a treatment condition, where they undergo some sort of intervention, or to a control conditi\nDoc 2(Title: \"Why is Racism a Problem? - Free Essay Example | PapersOwl.com\") How To Write An Essay On Racism\nIntroduction to the Complexities of Racism\nWriting an essay on racism involves delving into a complex and sensitive subject that has deep historical roots and contemporary implications. Begin your essay by defining racism as a system of discrimination based on race, affecting individuals and groups socially, economically, and politically. Highlight the importance of understanding racism not only as overt acts of discrimination but also as institutional and systemic practices. This introduction should lay the groundwork for your exploration, whether it’s focused on historical aspects of racism, its manifestations in modern society, or strategies for combating racial prejudice and inequality.\nHistorical Context and Evolution of Racism\nThe body of your essay should include a detailed examination of the historical context and evolution of racism. Discuss how racism has been perpetuated and institutionalized over time, highlighting key historical events and policies that have contributed to racial discrimination and segregation. Depending on your essay’s focus, you might explore the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, Jim Crow laws, or apartheid, among other topics. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding how past injustices continue to shape present racial dynamics and attitudes.\nAnalyzing Modern Manifestations of Racism\nTransition to discussing the modern manifestations of racism. Examine how racism operates in current societal structures, such as in the criminal justice system, education, employment, and healthcare. Discuss the concept of systemic racism and how it perpetuates inequality, as well as the impact of racial bias and stereotypes in media representation and everyday interactions. This section should also address the intersectionality of racism, acknowledging how race intersects with other identities like gender, class, and sexuality, contributing to unique experiences of discrimination.\nStrategies for Addressing and Combating Racism\nConclude your essay by exploring strategies for addressing and combating racism. Discuss the importance of education, awareness-raising, and open dialogue in challenging racist beliefs and stereotypes. Reflect on the role of policy changes, affirmative action, and reparations in addressing systemic racism. Emphasize the importance of individual and collective action in fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. Your conclusion should not only summarize the key points of your essay but also inspire a sense of hope and commitment to anti-racist efforts, underscoring the ongoing work needed to dismantle racism in all its forms.\nDoc 3(Title: \"12 Grand Challenges for Social Work - University of Nevada Reno\") rom institutions — and find effective ways to decrease the number of individuals going to prison, while offering sufficient solutions for overall public safety.\n11.

Of course, it’s nothing new for a nation with a long history of extreme racist violence—the most recent lynching-related death occurred in 1981, hardly a lifetime ago, when Michael Donald was hanged by two members of the Ku Klux Klan.The United States, however, continues to avoid its history on race, refusing to confront its past in a “post-racial,” “colorblind” society, and that policy of systemic ignorance is particularly strong when mention of racial equality is brought up. Although the concept of equality has never truly existed in this world, as can be traced back to the very beginnings of recorded history we see the nobles ruling the commoners, conquerors reigning over the conquered, the will of man dominating women; the United States needs to acknowledge the fact that racial inequality still exists within our country and has in no way progressed towards betterment.\nIs the society’s draconian attendance towards the people of distinguishable race a fair measure of precaution or an act of discrimination? In the society we live in today, the enactment of racial bias has made a monumental impact, shaping many individuals ' lives by default. However, is it fair for the innocent individuals to be shrouded with the burden of being a particular ‘race’? After witnessing, the incident of Ferguson, I became dreadfully discontented to discovered that people today have self-established the immense belief that people of color are the primary cause of danger, and therefore, they must be regarded as hazardous creatures. Moreover, the reason triggering the detrimental policing was due to the color of the victims, illustrating the ugly truth of racial profiling still remains intact to our society. Although racial profiling and prejudice are disavowed publicly by Americans, many statistics and research on implicit racial bias debated the citizens of the United States still perceive a person 's physical in determining their likeliness to committee crime (Bornstein, Avram). Unfortunately, it is ingrained in today’s society that institutional structures demonstrate persistent inequality and unequal distribution of societal resources (White, Rob).\nIn this day in age Racial stereotypes appear to be as rampant as they were in the early 200s. The discussion and debate about race can be a sensitive and difficult subject for most individuals. Living in America is tough as it is with all of the crisis’s and chaos taking place left and right. That matter of race is a crisis of its own so to speak. One cannot express themselves completely to the extent of his or her liking without being judged, labeled or categorized.\nRace refers to the physical form of some common genetic characteristics of the crowd. This is born, cannot be chosen. While ethnicity refers to the people with the same experience, cultural background or language. The United States as a migrant country, immigration culture, complex skin color, ethnic racial relations are complex. The race of society has been going on for more than half a century. Racism is a self centered attitude, and racial differences determine the history of human society and cultural development. Racial discrimination has always been a serious social problem. Racial discrimination is further convinced that the disaggregated differences are linked to hierarchical evaluations, and that various human races determine their culture or personal achievement, implying that certain races are\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Reasons Behind Service Delivery Protests in South ...\") s, an American sociologist, in a 1962 article titled ‘Towards a Theory of Revolution’ theorised about rising expectations and the likelihood of armed conflict. His theory became known as the Davies J-curve, a model that attempts to explain the position where the pace of an individual’s reality is not in keeping with his/her expectations about how much better off he/she should be. Normally the individual's situation is not so bad that it leads either to conflict or to frustration, but when there is a sudden downturn (e.g. in the economy) a major gap is created between expectations and reality, resulting in frustration and discontent. According to Davies’ theory of relative deprivation these frustrated expectations are a cause of social unrest and increases the potential for political unrest. It also helps to overcome the collective action problem, which may breed revolt. ‘Revolt’ is defined as an attempt to fundamentally change an organizational structure in a relatively short period.\nOther sociologists such as Ted Gurr agree that the primary cause for revolution is the widespread frustration with the socio-political situation in a particular country. In his book titled Why men rebel, published in 1970, he supports the ‘frustration-aggression’ theory that explains the violence often accompanying the expression of frustration. The more intense and prolonged the frustration, the greater the probability of aggression. He also argues that the intensity and scope of relative deprivation determines the potential for collective violence and concludes that frustration-aggression is the ‘primary source of the human capacity for violence’.\nAt this stage it would probably be accurate to describe the fairly limited scope of current service delivery protests in South Africa as symptoms only of socio-political instability. However, it would be fair to conclude that if this situation is allowed to continue over a prolonged period it has the potential to spread and develop into a fully-fledged revolt. Therefore, although it is important for the police to maintain order and to enforce the law, the solution to the problem does not lie in policing but much rather in speedy solutions to the socio-economic conditions that prevail in many communities. Urgent interventions in relation to the conditions that bedevil the efficient and effective functioning and service delivery of municipalities are crucial. Finally, politicians – especially those who are fairly certain that they will be appointed to government positions after elections - need to take much more responsibility for the promises they make and the expectations they create.\nDr Johan Burger, Senior Researcher, Crime, Justice and Politics Programme, ISS Tshwane (Pretoria)\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that crime and social injustices are interconnected through several mechanisms.

And the culture they created was sublime, awesome, majestic, lofty, glorious, and at all points subversive of the larger culture of enslavement that sought to destroy their humanity. The miracle of African American survival can be traced directly to the miraculous ways that our ancestors reinvented the religion that their “masters” thought would keep them subservient, Rather, that religion enabled them and their descendants to learn, to grow, to develop, to interpret and reinvent the world in which they were trapped; it enabled them to bide their time — ultimately, time for them to fight for their freedom, and for us to continue the fight for ours. It also gave them the moral authority to turn the mirror of religion back on their masters and to indict the nation for its original sin of allowing their enslavement to build up that “city upon a hill.” In exposing that hypocrisy at the heart of their “Christian” country, they exhorted succeeding generations to close the yawning gap between America’s founding ideals and the reality they had been forced to endure. Who were these people? As the late Rev. Joseph Lowery put it, “I don’t know whether the faith produced them, or if they produced the faith. But they belonged to each other.”\nPublished by arrangement with Penguin Press, a member of Penguin Random House, LLC.

These institutions birthed numerous Protestant denominations, non-Christian movements rooted in the liberation of black people, institutions of higher learning, and more.\nBecause of this immense history, power, and influence despite generations of ill treatment and racism, black churches need to thrive, continuing to speak truth to power and serve black communities beyond the sanctuary.\nAfrican-American clergy have historically played a visible role in the struggle for civil rights. Unique to black churches and clergy is the engagement of transforming community, meeting the needs of their congregations, and truly manifesting the meaning of service.\nCelebrated and noted amongst black clergy is the Rev. Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. Pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ for 36 years. Wright set the precedent for service beyond the sanctuary by establishing Trinity as the epicenter for holistic existence on the South Side of Chicago. They are the incarnate model of being unashamedly black, unapologetically beautiful. It was Wright who boldly professed in his pulpit that LGBTQ lives mattered in the sight of God, and told his congregation that they too are God’s children. His unapologetic witness, love, and inclusivity of all persons enabled him, through black liberation and womanist theologies, to possess a prophetic view that transcended tradition and practice. Wright built more than 60 ministries serving the church and its surrounding community. These included ministries for HIV/AIDS care, drug and alcohol recovery, hospice care, senior citizen health care, housing and child care program, a reading program for the poor, and 22 ministries for youth. This ministry continues today under the leadership of the revered Rev. Dr. Otis Moss, III.\nCurrently, pastors such as Rev. Dr. Delman Coates, senior pastor of Mt. Ennon Baptist Church, a thriving black megachurch in Clinton, Md., are continuing the work of economic empowerment, environmental justice, student debt relief, healthcare, health and wellness, and other issues important to the black community.\n“The black church was born out of the fight for freedom, justice, and equality,” said Coates. “Our voices cannot be silent and must speak truth to power.”\nMost noted is Coates’ founding and organizing of the Our Money Campaign, an issue-based advocacy campaign that seeks to bring Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) into the mainstream in order to solve some of our nation's greatest social and economic challenges.\n“Economic injustice exasperated the issues of race. When economic insecurity is exasperated, all matters of social injustice are too. We have to have a black church that understands economics at the macroeconomic level. The “Our Money Campaign” is to educate faith leaders, public, and others about the role of fiscal policy’s detrimental impact on our community,” said Coates.\nOther leaders have continued to serve the black community tirelessly: Rev. Dr. Howard-John Wesley of Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Va. hosts the largest HBCU College Fair with over 70 colleges and universities. Most recently, they made headlines for their $100,000 gift to cover the outstanding tuition and fee balances of 34 graduating seniors. Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist church is launching a campaign aimed at ending mass incarceration\nDoc 3(Title: \"\"The Black Church In America \" a story - African American ...\") *This Registry dates from 1758 and briefly describes the history of the Black Church in America. This institution was the first source of land ownership for black African slaves in America and is viewed as the reason and savior of oppressed African people in the United States.\nDuring the decades of southern slavery in America, slave associations were a constant source of concern to slave owners. For many members of white society, Black religious meetings symbolized the ultimate threat to white existence. Nevertheless, African slaves established and relied heavily on their churches. Religion offered a means of catharsis... Africans retained their faith in God and found refuge in their churches. However, white society was not always willing to accept the involvement of slaves in Christianity. As one slave recounted, \"The white folks would come in when the colored people would have a prayer meeting and whip every one of them. Most of them thought that when colored people were praying, it was against them”.\nReligious exercises of slaves were closely watched to detect plans for escape or insurrection. Black churches showed an air of militancy in the eyes of white Americans. Insurrections such as Nat Turner's in Virginia, born out of the religious inspiration of slaves, horrified white Americans. Understanding the potential end that could result from the religious experiences of African slaves, many white Americans opposed the participation of Blacks in Christianity. In African American history, \"the church\" has long been central to black communities. It has become the most significant Black religious enrichment and secular development source.\nThis development is embodied in Christianity, and the term \"the Black Church” presents many details of racial and religious lifestyles unique to Black history. In essence, the term \"the Black Church\" is a misnomer. It implies that all Black churches share the same aspirations and strategies for creating cohesive African American communities. This is untrue; numerous black community differences were reflected within their churches.\nBlack communities differed from region to region. They were divided along social lines, composed of persons from different economic levels, and maintained varying political philosophies. Black communities in the inner cities of the United States have traditionally differed from those in rural areas, etc. In The Negro Church in America, sociologist E. Franklin Frazier noted, \"Methodist and Baptist denominations were separate church organizations based upon distinctions of color and what were considered standards of civilized behavior.\"\nOrganized politically and spiritually, Black churches were not only given to the teachings of Christianity but were faithfully relied upon to address the specific issues that affected their members. For many African American Christians, black Churches have always represented their religion, community, and home regardless of denominational differences. Scholars have repeatedly asserted that Black history and Black church history overlap to be virtually identical. One of the First known Black churches in America was created before the American Revolution, around 1758. Called the African Baptist or \"Bluestone\" Church, this house of worship was founded on the William Byrd plantation near the Bluestone River in Mecklenburg, Virginia. Africans believed that only adult baptism by total immersion was doctrinally correct.\nBlack people in America also supported the autonomy of their congregation in making decisions independent of the larger church bodies. Other early Black Church milestones included the Baptist and Episcopal denominations. The First African Baptist Church of Savannah, Georgia, began in 1777. This is said to be the oldest Black church in North America. Originally called the First Colored Church, the pastoral life of George Leile’s preaching is tied to its beginning.\nIn 1787, Blacks in Philadelphia organized the Free African Societ\nDoc 4(Title: \"The history and importance of the Black Church – Harvard ...\") How the Black Church saved Black America\nHenry Louis Gates’ new book traces the institution’s role in history, politics, and culture\nExcerpted from “The Black Church: This is Our Story, This is Our Song” by Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Penguin Press)\nPolitical activists — including Malcolm X, of course, but especially the Black Panther Party in the latter half of the 1960s — have debated whether the role of the Black embrace of Christianity under slavery was a positive or negative force. There were those who argued that the Black Church was an example of Karl Marx’s famous indictment of religion as “the opium of the people” because it gave to the oppressed false comfort and hope, obscuring the causes of their oppression and reducing their urge to overturn that oppression. But I do not believe that religion functioned in this simple fashion in the history of Black people in this country.\nAs a matter of fact, although Marx was no fan of religion, to put it mildly, this statement, which the Panthers loved to quote, was part of a more complicated assessment of the nature and function of religion. The full quote bears repeating: “Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.” Marx could not imagine the complexity of the Black Church, even if the Black Church could imagine him — could imagine those who lacked the tools to see beyond its surface levels of meaning. James Weldon Johnson, in his lovely poem about the anonymous authors of the sacred vernacular tradition, “O Black and Unknown Bards,” put this failure of interpretive reciprocity in this memorable way:\nWhat merely living clod, what captive thing,\nCould up toward God through all its darkness grope,\nAnd find within its deadened heart to sing\nThese songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?\nHow did it catch that subtle undertone,\nThat note in music heard not with the ears?\nThe role of Black Christianity in motivating our country’s largest slave rebellion, Nat Turner’s rebellion, Southampton County, Va., is only the most dramatic example of the text of the King James Bible being called upon to justify the violent revolutionary overthrow of the slave regime. But we need only look at the brilliant use of the church in all of its forms — from W. E. B. Du Bois’s triptych of “the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy” to the use of the building itself — to see the revolutionary potential and practice of Black Christianity in forging social change. What most intrigues me about Marx’s full quote is his realization that it is at once “the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering,” a crucial part of the quote that seems to have fallen away.\nPeople, of course, pray and worship for all sorts of reasons. Despite what Marx and the Black Panthers thought, the importance of the role of the Black Church at its best cannot be gainsaid in the history of the African American people. Nor can it be underestimated. It isn’t religion that keeps human beings enslaved; it is violence. Most normal human beings don’t need an elaborate religious belief system to resist the temptation to sacrifice their lives in the face of overwhelming odds and the certainty that they will be brutally suppressed and killed. That would be unreasonable.\nThe “failure” of African Americans to overthrow their masters, as the enslaved men and women did on the island that became the Republic of Haiti, can’t be traced to the role of the church per se, as Nat Turner’s decision to act based on his interpretation of prophecy attests. Early on, the church and Christianity played a role both in Black rebellions and in the preparation of Black people for leadership roles. Following Denmark Vesey’s alleged slave insurrection, Emanuel Church in Charleston, S.C., was burned to the ground; at the end of\nDoc 5(Title: \"The history and importance of the Black Church – Harvard ...\") reflecting on his many marches for justice, “we, the people” once again bore witness to the deeper historical reality that faith has long been the source of the courage of those toiling on the front lines of change. As Lewis once put it, “The civil rights movement was based on faith. Many of us who were participants in this movement saw our involvement as an extension of our faith.”\nOne of the greatest achievements in the long history of civilization, as far as I am concerned, is the extraordinary resilience of the African American community under slavery, through the sheer will and determination of these men and women to live to see another day, to thrive. The number of Africans dragged to North America between 1526 and 1808, when the slave trade ended, totaled approximately 388,000 shipped directly from continent to continent, plus another 52,430 through the intra-American trade. That initial population had grown to some 4.4 million free and enslaved people by 1860. How was this possible? What sustained our ancestors under the nightmare of enslavement to build families and survive their being ripped apart and sold off in the domestic trade; to carry on despite not being able to ward off the rapacious sexual advances of their masters (a verity exposed by DNA, which shows that the average African American is more than 24 percent European); to acquire skills; to create a variety of complex cultural forms; to withstand torture, debasement, and the suffocating denial of their right to learn to read and write; and to defer the gratification of freedom from bondage — all without ever giving up the hope of liberty, as one enslaved poet, George Moses Horton, put it, if not for themselves, then for their children or grandchildren, when slavery had no end in sight? What empowered them with “hope against hope”? The writer Darryl Pinckney in a recent essay notes that “if a person cannot imagine a future, then we would say that that person is depressed.” To paraphrase Pinckney’s next line, if a people cannot imagine a future, then its culture will die.\n“The importance of the role of the Black Church at its best cannot be gainsaid in the history of the African American people. Nor can it be underestimated.”\nAnd Black culture didn’t die. The signal aspects of African American culture were planted, watered, given light, and nurtured in the Black Church, out of the reach and away from the watchful eyes of those who would choke the life out of it. We have to give the church its due as a source of our ancestors’ unfathomable resiliency and perhaps the first formalized site for the collective fashioning and development of so many African American aesthetic forms. Although Black people made spaces for secular expression, only the church afforded room for all of it to be practiced at the same time. And only in the church could all of the arts emerge, be on display, practiced and perfected, and expressed at one time and in one place, including music, dance, and song; rhetoric and oratory; poetry and prose; textual exegesis and interpretation; memorization, reading, and writing; the dramatic arts and scripting; call-and-response, signifying, and indirection; philosophizing and theorizing; and, of course, mastering all of “the flowers of speech.” We do the church a great disservice if we fail to recognize that it was the first formalized site within African American culture perhaps not exclusively for the fashioning of the Black aesthetic, but certainly for its performance, service to service, week by week, Sunday to Sunday.\nThe Black Church was the cultural cauldron that Black people created to combat a system designed to crush their spirit. Collectively and with enormous effort, they refused to allow that to happen. And the culture they created was sublime, awesome, majestic, lofty, glorious, and at all points subversive of the larger culture of enslavement that sought to destroy their humanity.

As the commander-in-chief, the president has the ability to use wartime powers to enforce special laws. The Emancipation Proclamation was one of those laws that Lincoln had used his military powers to enforce.\nOriginally, Lincoln believed in the progressive elimination of slavery in all states. He believed that it was primarily up to the states to oversee the progressive abolition of slavery in their own individual power. Regardless of his political position on the matter, however, Lincoln had always believed that slavery was wrong. The Emancipation Proclamation served more as a military maneuver than a political maneuver. At the same time, this action cemented Lincoln as being a staunchly aggressive abolitionist and would ensure that slavery would eventually be removed from the entire United States.\nOne major political effect that the Emancipation Proclamation had was the fact that it invited slaves to serve in the Union Army. Such an action was a brilliant strategic choice. The decision to pass a law that told all slaves from the South that they were free and encouraging them to take up arms to join in the fight against their former masters was the brilliant tactical maneuver. Ultimately with those permissions, many freed slaves joined the Northern Army, drastically increasing their manpower. The North by the end of the war had over 200,000 African-Americans fighting for them.\nThe South was more or less in a state of turmoil after such an announcement. The proclamation had actually been publicized three times, the first time as a threat, the second time as a more formal announcement and then the third time as the signing of the Proclamation. When the Confederates heard the news, they were in a state of severe disrepair. One of them primary issues was that as the North advanced into territories and seized control of Southern land, they would often capture slaves. These slaves were simply restricted as contraband, not returned to their owners – the South.\nWhen the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, all current contraband, i.e. the slaves, were freed at the stroke of midnight. There was no offer of compensation, payment, or even a fair trade to the slave-owners. These slave-holders were suddenly deprived of what they believe to be property. Combined with the sudden loss of a large number of slaves, and influx of troops that would provide the North with additional firepower, the South found itself in a very tough position. Slaves were now able to escape from the South and as soon as they made it into the North, they would be free.\nYet as important as the Emancipation Proclamation was to America’s history, its actual impact on slavery was minimal at best. If nothing more, it was a way to solidify the president’s position as an abolitionist and to ensure the fact that slavery would be ended. Slavery wasn’t officially ended in the United States of America until the 13th Amendment was passed, in 1865.\nOne of the issues with the Emancipation Proclamation was that it was passed as a wartime measure. As stated before, in the United States, laws are not passed through the president, they are passed by Congress. This left the actual freedom status of the slaves up in the air. If the North were to win the war, the Emancipation Proclamation would not continue to be a constitutionally legal document. It would need to be ratified by the government in order to stay in effect.\nThe purpose of the Emancipation Proclamation has been muddled over the course of history. The basic line of though is that it freed the slaves. That is only partially correct, it merely freed the slaves in the South, something that wasn’t particularly enforceable due to the fact South was in a state of rebellion. What it did do however was ensure that if the North won, the South would be forced to free all of their slaves. Ultimately that would lead to the freedom of 3.1 million slaves.

However, most of those slaves were not free until after the war had concluded.\nLatest US History Articles\nWho Invented the Assembly Line?

Eli Whitney and Cotton Gin Impact on America\nThe Most Famous Outlaws of the Wild West: Jesse James to Robert Leroy Parker\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was criticized on all sides of the political spectrum. The proslavery movement believed that it was wrong and immoral for the president to inflict such a thing, but their hands were tied due to the fact that they wanted the Union to be preserved. The North had originally tried to use the Emancipation Proclamation as a threat to the South.\nThe terms were simple, return to the Union or face the dire consequences of having all slaves freed. When the South refused to return, the North decided to unleash the document. This left Lincoln’s political opponents in a bind because they didn’t want to lose their slaves, but at the same time it would be a disaster if United States were to divide up into two different nations.\nThere was a lot of flak in the abolitionist movement as well. Many of the abolitionists believed that it wasn’t a sufficient document because it did not totally eradicate slavery and in fact was barely enforceable in the states that it did authorize such release. Since the South was in a state of war, there wasn’t much impetus for them to comply with the order.\nLincoln was criticized by many different factions, and even among historians there is a question as to what his motives were in his decisions. But it is important to remember that the success of the Emancipation Proclamation hinged on the victory of the North. If the North was successful and was able to seize control of the Union once again, reunifying all the states and putting the South out of its state of rebellion, it would have freed all of their slaves.\nThere was no going back from this decision. The rest of America would be forced to follow suit. This meant that Abraham Lincoln was well aware of the ramifications of his actions. He knew that the Emancipation Proclamation was not a permanent, final solution to the problem of slavery but rather it was a powerful opening salvo to an entirely new type of war.\nThis changed the purpose of the Civil War as well. Prior to the Emancipation Proclamation, the North was engaged in military action against the South due to the fact of the South was trying to secede from the Union. Originally, the war as seen by the North, was a war to preserve the unity of America. The South was trying to secede because of a myriad of reasons. There are a lot of simplistic reasons offered for why the North and the South were divided.\nThe most common reason stated is that the South wanted to have slavery and Lincoln was purely a staunch abolitionist. Another theory was that the Civil War was started because the South wanted a greater level of states’ rights, whereas the current Republican Party was pushing for a more unified type of government. The reality is that the motivations of the South’s secession is a mixed bag. It was most likely a collection of all the above ideas. To say there was a single reason for the Civil War is a massive underestimation of how politics works.\nRegardless of the South’s purpose for leaving the union, when the North made the decision to free the slaves, it became very clear that this would become an abolitionist war. The South relied heavily on their slaves in order to survive. Their economics were based primarily on a slave economy, as opposed to the North which had been developing a primarily industrial economy.\nThe North with higher level of education, weaponry, and production capability did not rely on slaves a\nDoc 3(Title: \"Emancipation Proclamation: Effects Impacts and Outcomes\") There is one document from the American Civil War that is considered to be one of the most important, valuable and impactful of all documents. That document was known as the Emancipation Proclamation.\nThis executive order was drafted and signed by Abraham Lincoln on January 1st, 1863, during the Civil War. Many people believe that the emancipation proclamation effectively ended slavery but the truth is far more complicated than that.\nRecommended Reading\nLouisiana Purchase: Date, Cost, Importance, and Results\nEmancipation Proclamation: Effects, Impacts, and Outcomes\nHow Old Is the United States of America?\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was a momentous occasion in the history of the United States. It was created by Abraham Lincoln as a way to try and take advantage of the rebellion that was currently underway in the south. This rebellion was known as the Civil War, with the North and the South divided due to ideological differences.\nThe political situation of the Civil War was relatively dire. With the South in a state of outright rebellion, it was on Abraham Lincoln’s shoulders to try and preserve the Union at all costs. The war itself was still not recognized by the North as a war, because Abraham Lincoln refused to recognize the South as its own nation. While the South prefer to call itself the Confederate States of America, to the north they were still states of the United States of America.\nCivil War Biographies\nAnn Rutledge: Abraham Lincoln’s First True Love?\nThe Paradoxical President: Re-imagining Abraham Lincoln\nThe Right Arm of Custer: Colonel James H. Kidd\nNathan Bedford Forrest: Life and Service of the Military Genius\nThe Emancipation Proclamation’s entire purpose was to free the slaves in the South. In fact, the Emancipation Proclamation had nothing to do with slavery in the North. The Union would still be a slave nation during the war, despite the fact that Abraham Lincoln would y be laying the ground for a greater abolitionist movement. When the proclamation was passed, it was aimed at the states that were currently in rebellion; the entire purpose was to disarm the South.\nDuring the Civil War, the Southern economy was primarily based on slavery. With the majority of men fighting in the Civil War, slaves were used primarily for reinforcing soldiers, transporting goods, and working in agricultural labor back home. The South did not have the same level of industrialism without slavery, as the North did. Essentially, when Lincoln passed to the Emancipation Proclamation it was actually an attempt to weaken the Confederate states by removing one of their strongest methods of production.\nThis decision was primarily pragmatic; Lincoln was focused entirely on disarming the South. However, regardless of intentions, the Emancipation Proclamation signaled a shift in the purpose of the Civil War. The war was no longer simply about preserving the state of the union, the war was more or less about ending slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation was not a well-received action. It was a strange political maneuver and even most of Lincoln’s cabinet was hesitant to believe that it would be effective. The reason that the Emancipation Proclamation is such a curious document is because it was passed as under the President’s war-time powers.\nNormally, the American Presidency has very little power of decree. Lawmaking and legislative control belongs to Congress. The President does have the ability to issue what is known as an executive order. Executive orders have the full backing and force of a law, but for the most part they are subject to control from Congress. The president himself has very little power outside of what Congress allows, except in wartime. As the commander-in-chief, the president has the ability to use wartime powers to enforce special laws. The Emancipation Proclamation was one of those laws that Lincoln had used his military powers to enforce.\nOriginally, Lincoln believed in the progressive elimination of slavery in al\nDoc 4(Title: \"The 13 Colonies in the Revolutionary War\") er the war was characterized by economic depression and political crisis.\nThe thirteen states at the time were ruled by a Confederation Government that was only unified by the Articles of Confederation. Each state remained sovereign and could govern its own way.\nCongress didn’t have any power to tax or regulate trade and there were no executive or judicial branches in the government to enforce laws.\nAs a result, the government couldn’t generate revenue to pay its massive war debts.\nWithout a strong central government to regulate trade, trade between the states suffered due to restrictive state tariffs and commercial regulations.\nFurthermore, an unfavorable trade balance with foreign countries was draining hard money out of the United States.\nIn response, several states began issuing paper money which added to the enormous amount of paper money printed during the war and essentially made it lose its value.\nThe expanding currency and depreciation immediately resulted in a corresponding rise in prices which further contributed to the deteriorating economy.\nIn response to the economic and political crisis of the 1780s, the need for political reform and a stronger Federal government soon grew.\nOn February 22, 1786, Congress approved a plan to hold the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 in order to revise the Articles of Confederation.\nOn March 4, 1789, the current United States Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation.\nThe Constitution gave the government the power to tax, which greatly improved the government’s finances, and also prohibited states from issuing paper money, which also improved capital markets.\nThis newly strengthened central government affected the economy in small but significant ways, according to an article, titled Economic Interests and the Adoption of the United States Constitution, on EH.net:\n“Walton and Shepherd conclude that the most important changes associated with the Constitution ‘were those changes that strengthened the framework for protection of private property and enforcement of contracts’ (pp. 187-88). These changes were most important because they increased the benefits of exchange (the cornerstone of a market economy) and created incentives for individuals to specialize in economic activities in which they had a particular advantage and then engage in mutually advantageous exchange (trade) with individuals specializing in other economic activities. Specific provisions in the Constitution that helped to increase the benefits of exchange were those that prohibited the national and state governments from enacting ex-post-facto laws (retroactive laws) and a provision that prohibited the state governments from passing any ‘law impairing the obligation of contracts.’ These prohibitions were important to the development of a market economy because they constrained governments from interfering in economic exchange, making the returns to economic activity more secure.”\nSince the economies of the thirteen states weren’t highly interconnected in the 1780s, the immediate effect of the Constitution was small.\nYet, the creation of the Constitution was still significant because it eventually became the foundation of the national government.\nIt took nearly twenty years before the American economy turned around, but when it did, it flourished. The United States became a world power sometime in the 1870s or 1880s when its economy became the largest economy in the world.\nYet, the rest of the world didn’t see the United States as a super power until 1898 when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish-American war and took various Spanish colonies such as Cuba, Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico.\nAfter WWII, the British Empire was dismantled and the United States and the USSR were only superpowers left.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia lost its super power status and the United States has since remained the sole global super power.\nSources:\n“Economic Interests and\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Emancipation Proclamation and the Meaning of the War ...\") nd the Supreme Court during the Civil War: A Letter from Attorney General Edward Bates.” (Journal of Supreme Court History 37.3, November 2012)\nJonathan White, Lincoln on Law, Leadership, and Life.

Ways to Reduce Hyperinflation – change currency\nIn a period of hyperinflation, conventional policies may be unsuitable. Expectations of future inflation may be hard to change. When people have lost confidence in a currency, it may be necessary to introduce a new currency or use another like the dollar (e.g. Zimbabwe hyperinflation).\nWays to reduce Cost-Push Inflation\nCost-push inflation (e.g. due to rising oil prices) can lead to inflation and lower growth. This is the worst of both worlds and is more difficult to control without leading to lower growth. In 2022 the world saw a rise in cost-push inflation due to rising energy prices and the end of Covid lockdown causing supply shortages.\nCost-push inflation is more difficult to reduce because it is fundamentally caused by supply problems. Raising interest rates is a blunt tool and likely to cause unacceptably lower growth. This is why Central Banks tend to tolerate a higher rate of cost-push inflation and hope it is short-lived. In the long-term we can try and tackle the supply issues, such as more flexible labour markets, stock-piling oil reserves to deal with crises and policies to increase competitiveness.\nFurther reading\nDoc 2(Title: \"Methods to Control Inflation - Economics Help\") demand. If economic growth is rapid, reducing the growth of AD can reduce inflationary pressures without causing a recession.\nAlso increasing taxes to reduce inflation is likely to be politically unpopular which is why fiscal policy is rarely used to reduce inflation.\nOther Policies to Reduce Inflation\n1. Reduce expectations\nA key determinant of inflation over time is inflation expectations. If people expect inflation next year, firms will put up prices and workers will demand higher wages. This expectation tends to cause higher inflation. If the Central Bank and government can effectively reduce expectations by making credible threats to bring inflation under control, this will make their job easier.\n2. Price controls\nWith inflation, we will see firms trying to increase prices as much as they can to maintain profitability and deal with rising costs. One way to try to avoid this ‘profit-push’ inflation is to introduce price controls. This is where the government sets limits on price increases.\nFor example, in 1971 President Nixon imposed a price freeze that he reintroduced in 1973 after winning the election. The price freezes were politically popular for a short time but basically failed. Firms restricted supply and when price freezes ended, suppressed inflation returned with a vengeance. However, it is worth noting that price controls during wartime were successful in reducing inflation. One study by Paul Evans found in WWII price controls were successful in keeping prices 30% lower than otherwise. (though this was with rationing and 7% lower output).\n3. Wage Control\nIf inflation is caused by wage inflation (e.g. powerful unions bargaining for higher real wages), then limiting wage growth can help to moderate inflation. Lower wage growth will reduce the costs for firms and lead to less excess demand in the economy.\nHowever, as the UK discovered in the 1970s, it can be difficult to control inflation through income policies, especially if the unions are powerful. Also, wage control requires widespread co-operation in the economy, but if firms are facing labour shortages they will be more concerned to get the workers, even if they have to exceed government wage controls.\n4. Monetarism\nMonetarism seeks to control inflation by controlling the money supply. Monetarists believe there is a strong link between the money supply and inflation. If you can control the growth of the money supply, then you should be able to bring inflation under control. Monetarists would stress policies such as:\n- Higher interest rates (tightening monetary policy)\n- Reducing budget deficit (deflationary fiscal policy)\n- Control of money being created by the government\nHowever, in practice, the link between money supply and inflation is less strong.\n5. Supply-Side Policies\nOften inflation is caused by persistent uncompetitiveness and rising costs. Supply-side policies may enable the economy to become more competitive and help to moderate inflationary pressures. For example, more flexible labour markets may help reduce inflationary pressure.\nHowever, supply-side policies can take a long time, and cannot deal with inflation caused by rising demand.\n6. Exchange rate policy\nA country may seek to keep inflation low by joining a fixed exchange rate mechanism. The argument is that if the value of a currency is fixed (or semi-fixed) then this creates a discipline to keep inflation low. If inflation rises, the currency would become uncompetitive and start to fall. In the late 1980s, the UK joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) partly to bring inflation under control. However, targetting inflation through the exchange rate can is difficult and the UK was forced to leave the ERM in 1992.\n6. Ways to Reduce Hyperinflation – change currency\nIn a period of hyperinflation, conventional policies may be unsuitable. Expectations of future inflation may be hard to change. When people have lost confidence in a currency, it may be necessary to introduce a new curren\nDoc 3(Title: \"Methods to Control Inflation - Economics Help\") Inflation is generally controlled by the Central Bank and/or the government. The main policy used is monetary policy (changing interest rates). However, in theory, there are a variety of tools to control inflation including:\n- Monetary policy – Higher interest rates reduce demand in the economy, leading to lower economic growth and lower inflation.\n- Control of money supply – Monetarists argue there is a close link between the money supply and inflation, therefore controlling money supply can control inflation.\n- Supply-side policies – policies to increase the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy, putting downward pressure on long-term costs.\n- Fiscal policy – a higher rate of income tax could reduce spending, demand and inflationary pressures.\n- Wage/price controls – trying to control wages and prices could, in theory, help to reduce inflationary pressures. However, they are rarely used because they are not usually effective.\nVideo\nMonetary Policy\nIn a period of rapid economic growth, demand in the economy could be growing faster than its capacity to meet it. This leads to inflationary pressures as firms respond to shortages by putting up the price. We can term this demand-pull inflation.\nIn response to inflation, the Central bank could increase interest rates.\n- Higher interest rates rates make borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive.\n- Homeowners will have to pay increase mortgage payments, leading to less disposable income to spend.\n- Therefore households will have less ability and incentive to spend\n- Also firms will be detered from borrowing to fund investment, leading to lower business investment.\n- Therefore, higher interest rates are quite effective in slowing down consumer spending and investment, leading to a lower rate of economic growth. And as economic growth slows down, so does inflation.\nA higher interest rate should also lead to a higher exchange rate (higher interest rate attracts hot money flows) The appreciation in the exchange rate will also reduce inflationary pressure by:\n- Making imports cheaper. (There will be lower price of imported goods, such as petrol and raw materials)\n- Reducing demand for exports and therefore lower total demand in the economy.\n- Because exports are less competitive, exporting firms will have an incentive to cut costs and improve competitiveness over time.\nUK Inflation and interest rates\nInterest rates were increased in 2022 to deal with the surge in inflation. However, the increase in interest rates is relatively low compared to the size of the inflation. This is because the Bank of England hope the inflation will prove temporary.\nInflation and interest rates post-war\nIf we look at inflation and interest rates in the post-war period, we can see interest rates rose to 15% in 1990 to deal with inflation of 10%.\nInflation target\nAs part of monetary policy, many countries have an inflation target (e.g. UK inflation target of 2%, +/-1). The argument is that if people believe the inflation target is credible, then it will help to lower inflation expectations. If inflation expectations are low, it becomes easier to control inflation.\nCountries have also made Central Bank independent in setting monetary policy. The argument is that an independent Central Bank will be free from political pressures and avoid making mistakes like cutting interest rates before an election to curry favour with voters.\nFiscal Policy\nTo reduce inflation, the government can increase taxes (such as income tax and VAT) and cut spending. This improves the government’s budget situation and helps to reduce demand in the economy.\nBoth these policies reduce inflation by reducing the growth of aggregate demand. If economic growth is rapid, reducing the growth of AD can reduce inflationary pressures without causing a recession.\nAlso increasing taxes to reduce inflation is likely to be politically unpopular which is why fiscal policy is rarely used to reduce inflation.\nOther Policies to Reduce Infla\nDoc 4(Title: \"How to Stop Inflation - Foundation for Economic Education\") To know truly is to know by causes. — Francis Bacon\nHow to stop inflation? Remove the cause! Stopping inflation is as simple and as difficult as that. Everyone says he’s against inflation; yet, what do we find? Nearly everyone overlooking the sole remedy and, instead, conjuring up schemes to soften inflation’s disastrous effects. Interestingly, all schemes or nostrums which ignore the cause, if and when adopted, sink us ever deeper into the mire. As if inflation weren’t bad enough, most proffered “cures” would worsen the situation!\nMany years ago a professor of economics told a group of us about his experiences at the University of Heidelberg during the German inflation. Faculty members were paid once a month. As the inflation began to gallop, they were paid twice a month, then each week, then each day. Finally, they were paid in the morning, rushing the checks home to their Frauen before going to their classrooms. Why? Prices were multiplying many times each day, so shop in the morning! There came a time — August 1923 — when 100 billion marks would not buy a loaf of bread.\nWhat was this professor’s recommendation to those in our group who foresaw similar problems in our own country? His advice was to out-produce inflation! Imagine a professor of economics not understanding that all production creates its own purchasing power!\nA few thoughts inspired by the professor’s naive thinking: Production involves the efficient combination and use of scarce resources, in the process paying for each resource a price high enough to pull it away from other owners and other uses. To produce more housing, for instance, involves paying higher wages, higher prices for lumber, hardware, masonry, and the like, to attract those scarce resources from other uses. Meanwhile, each supplier of such resources has the additional income to spend, a process sometimes expressed as Say’s Law: “Production creates its own purchasing power.”\nThe truth is that inflation does not result from the lack of housing or other goods or services. It is nothing more nor less than the printing of what the government has declared to be legal tender, that is, printing ever-increasing quantities of fiat money. Unless house-building or other productive activities stop those printing presses — an absurdity — then trying to out-produce inflation is as futile as trying to out-run one’s own shadow. So the professor’s cure is on a level with most remedies now being dinned into our ears.\nTrying to Live with It\nIt is not that the inventors of these schemes agree with inflation. Quite the contrary! Rather, it is that they see no way to be rid of it; inflation is here to stay —even worsen — thus, why not find a way to prosper and thrive in a monetary holocaust! The fact that this requires non-existent skills in legerdemain deters them not.\nTwo such schemes recently came to my attention. The first proposes that all contracts — loans, for instance — be repaid (legally enforced) in dollars of the same purchasing value as when contracted. If the value of the dollar should decline at the rate of 15 per cent a year, then a 10-year loan of a thousand dollars would be repaid in the amount of more than $5,000, plus interest.\nEven in the face of the current inflationary pattern, what borrower would be willing to sign such a contract? Only the person who cannot see “beyond the end of his nose.” There would be little if any futures trading; indeed, contractual relations would all but cease, production would decline at a frightening rate. Further, there is nothing in this scheme to halt the outpouring of fiat money; it would go on its merry way and, because of the fall off in production, the dollar would buy far less than were the scheme never adopted. Approval? Indeed, not!\nThe other scheme requires that all business ventures be compelled to adopt the “profit-sharing” procedure — employees as well as entrepreneurs sharing in the gains.\nThis is inspired by some remarkable successes such as Lincoln\nDoc 5(Title: \"How to Stop Inflation - Foundation for Economic Education\") know that inflation is deadly — for parasites cannot exist without hosts. As the troughs empty, attrition increases, especially among the parasites.\nAs this natural aristocracy — comprised of men of virtue and talents — approaches the pink of condition, rises to the top in thinking how self-interest is best served, the nonsense is stopped dead, then subsides! Your role and mine? Try one’s best to be this kind of an exemplary aristocrat. This, I submit, is the sole formula to stop inflation.\n***\nFiat Money Inflation in France\nOut of the inflation of prices grew a speculating class; and, in the complete uncertainty as to the future, all business became a game of chance, and all businessmen, gamblers. In city centers came a quick growth of stockjobbers and speculators; and these set a debasing fashion in business which spread to the remotest parts of the country. Instead of satisfaction with legitimate profits, came a passion for inordinate gains. Then, too, as values became more and more uncertain, there was no longer any motive for care or economy, but every motive for immediate expenditure and present enjoyment. So came upon the nation the obliteration of thrift. In this mania for yielding to present enjoyment rather than providing for future comfort were the seeds of new growths of wretchedness: luxury, senseless and extravagant, set in. This, too, spread as a fashion. To feed it, there came cheatery in the nation at large and corruption among officials and persons holding trusts. While men set such fashions in private and official business, women set fashions of extravagance in dress and living that added to the incentives to corruption….\nThus was the history of France logically developed in obedience to natural laws; such has, to a greater or lesser degree, always been the result of irredeemable paper….\nANDREW DICKSON WHITE\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, lowering inflation can be achieved through various methods:\n\n1. **Monetary Policy**: Increasing interest rates reduces demand in the economy, leading to lower inflation.

This institution was the first source of land ownership for black African slaves in America and is viewed as the reason and savior of oppressed African people in the United States.\nDuring the decades of southern slavery in America, slave associations were a constant source of concern to slave owners. For many members of white society, Black religious meetings symbolized the ultimate threat to white existence. Nevertheless, African slaves established and relied heavily on their churches. Religion offered a means of catharsis... Africans retained their faith in God and found refuge in their churches. However, white society was not always willing to accept the involvement of slaves in Christianity. As one slave recounted, \"The white folks would come in when the colored people would have a prayer meeting and whip every one of them. Most of them thought that when colored people were praying, it was against them”.\nReligious exercises of slaves were closely watched to detect plans for escape or insurrection. Black churches showed an air of militancy in the eyes of white Americans. Insurrections such as Nat Turner's in Virginia, born out of the religious inspiration of slaves, horrified white Americans. Understanding the potential end that could result from the religious experiences of African slaves, many white Americans opposed the participation of Blacks in Christianity. In African American history, \"the church\" has long been central to black communities. It has become the most significant Black religious enrichment and secular development source.\nThis development is embodied in Christianity, and the term \"the Black Church” presents many details of racial and religious lifestyles unique to Black history. In essence, the term \"the Black Church\" is a misnomer. It implies that all Black churches share the same aspirations and strategies for creating cohesive African American communities. This is untrue; numerous black community differences were reflected within their churches.\nBlack communities differed from region to region. They were divided along social lines, composed of persons from different economic levels, and maintained varying political philosophies. Black communities in the inner cities of the United States have traditionally differed from those in rural areas, etc. In The Negro Church in America, sociologist E. Franklin Frazier noted, \"Methodist and Baptist denominations were separate church organizations based upon distinctions of color and what were considered standards of civilized behavior.\"\nOrganized politically and spiritually, Black churches were not only given to the teachings of Christianity but were faithfully relied upon to address the specific issues that affected their members. For many African American Christians, black Churches have always represented their religion, community, and home regardless of denominational differences. Scholars have repeatedly asserted that Black history and Black church history overlap to be virtually identical. One of the First known Black churches in America was created before the American Revolution, around 1758. Called the African Baptist or \"Bluestone\" Church, this house of worship was founded on the William Byrd plantation near the Bluestone River in Mecklenburg, Virginia. Africans believed that only adult baptism by total immersion was doctrinally correct.\nBlack people in America also supported the autonomy of their congregation in making decisions independent of the larger church bodies. Other early Black Church milestones included the Baptist and Episcopal denominations. The First African Baptist Church of Savannah, Georgia, began in 1777. This is said to be the oldest Black church in North America. Originally called the First Colored Church, the pastoral life of George Leile’s preaching is tied to its beginning.\nIn 1787, Blacks in Philadelphia organized the Free African Societ\nDoc 2(Title: \"Why the Enslaved Adopted the Religion ... - Christianity Today\") ection had proved its power; there are Christians—even among African Americans.\nThese black Christians of old did not simply just adopt the religion of their oppressors; they used the power and practices of Christianity to blaze “The Path” of freedom and deliverance for many who would follow after. This reality didn’t just inform their thinking; it informed their living. Their theology invaded every aspect of African American identity.\nWhen Protten traveled the rough roads of the island of Antigua, her life would be the catalyst for the life of Sojourner Truth, the slave woman turned evangelist champion for the end of slavery. When Allen decided to walk out of the dark clouds of segregation and into the sunshine of racial justice, his life would be a catalyst for the young Martin Luther King Jr. who would do the same. When Lee had the courage to stand up and proclaim God’s truth despite being a woman, her life would be a catalyst for the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, who would always say, “You have to step out and trust God.” They gave birth to what we know as black Christianity today.\nThis strong tradition gave a people hope that God would act to provide justice for enslaved Africans and all who were oppressed. It was this faith that gave African Americans the arguments against the religion of the slaveholders. It gave a people a profound sense of dignity, identity, and significance, which led the church to be the most enduring and shaping institution in the African American story.\nAuthor Juan Williams writes that “individual black people took on a cloak of faith, an unshakable belief that God would carry them through slavery and lift them up to freedom.” They transformed themselves into “Christian soldiers, marching for an end to segregation and for the promise of equality as God’s children … then they transformed the church.” Much more, they transformed Christianity as we know it. It would do us well to not only listen to these stories of the past and be transformed by them in the present. May God make it so.\nDante Stewart is a student at Reformed Theological Seminary. He is a graduate of Clemson University, where he was a student athlete and received a BA in sociology. He and his wife, Jasamine, live in Augusta, Georgia, where he teaches Bible at Heritage Academy Augusta.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Why the Enslaved Adopted the Religion ... - Christianity Today\") In this series\n“The Resurrection has proved its power; there are Christians—even in Rome.” This is how Karl Barth, renowned Swiss theologian, described the conversion of the Roman Christians in his famous work The Epistle to the Romans. What he meant was that the resurrection of Jesus Christ had proved its reality because there were, in fact, Christians in Rome, the capital of the oppressive empire whose authority had crucified Jesus, and that was indeed sufficient grounds for thanksgiving and belief.\nAs I reflected on the words of Barth, I couldn’t help but realize that as he was describing the faith of the Roman Christians, he was also telling the story of black Christianity. The simple fact that the enslaved were able to “hold on” to Jesus, as it were, is in our day a story of the power of the Resurrection. Emerson Powery and Rodney Sadler Jr. shared in their book, The Genesis of Liberation, “African-Americans’ respect for the authority of the Christian Scriptures is a miracle in itself.”\nYou have to look no further than to the “Christ” they were introduced to to see the miracle. The “Jesus” they met in the Middle Passage and on the plantations was firmly on the side of the oppressor and opposing their freedom. This experience was not a neutral one. He clearly was used by the slavers and planters to pacify the slaves and to justify their enslavement. He clearly anointed and appointed the oppressors, not for the ministry of reconciliation but for their “ministry of subjugation.” He was the “White Man’s Jesus.”\nIn spite of this introduction, Powery and Sadler conclude that many African Americans, though not all, became Christians and attributed authority to the Bible. The question that remains is why. Why did enslaved Africans embrace the religion of their captors, who used the Bible to justify the brutal trans-Atlantic slave trade?\nPowery and Sadler’s simple answer is that “they fell in love with the God of Scripture.…In Christ they found salvation from their sins and reconciliation.” They conclude that though this was certainly enough, there was more to the answer. They write: In these texts they found not just an otherworldly God offering spiritual blessings, but a here-and-now God who cared principally for the oppressed, acting historically and eschatologically to deliver the down trodden from their abusers. They also found Jesus, a suffering Savior whose life and struggles paralleled their own struggles.\nIn the biblical narratives that described these characters the enslaved Africans found reasons to believe not only in the liberating power of the God of Scripture, but in the liberating emphasis of Scripture itself. Because they learned that the Bible did not denigrate African identity, they were able to use it to ground their humanity, subversively to rebut biblically based supremacist readings, to validate their right to be free and function as equals in this nation.\nAs they came in contact with this God, they found a different reality in him: the reality of Resurrection power. It was this reality that provided the basis for what would be deemed by historians Sylvia Frey and Betty Wood as “perhaps the defining moment in African American history” because “it created a community of faith and … provided Afro-Atlantic people with an ideology of resistance.” The Resurrection had proved its power; there are Christians—even among African Americans.\nThe Black Reformation of 1736\nIf the Protestant Reformation of 1517 is deemed the greatest religious movement in European history, then one could conclude that the Black Reformation of 1736 is the greatest religious movement in American history. But this begs the question, can it be called a “reformation”? Author Juan Williams argues indeed it can be. In his book on African American religious history, This Far By Faith, Williams writes, “Africans did not simply adopt the religion of the European Colonist; they used the power, principles, and practices of Christianity to blaze a pat\nDoc 4(Title: \"\"The Black Church In America \" a story - African American ...\") rican Baptist Church of Savannah, Georgia, began in 1777. This is said to be the oldest Black church in North America. Originally called the First Colored Church, the pastoral life of George Leile’s preaching is tied to its beginning.\nIn 1787, Blacks in Philadelphia organized the Free African Society, the first organized Afro-American society, and Absalom Jones and Richard Allen were elected as overseers. They established contact and created relationships with similar Black groups in other cities. Five years later, the Society began to build a church dedicated to July 17, 1794. The African Church applied for membership in the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The end of the Confederacy signaled freedom for millions of southern Black slaves and prompted the emancipation of the Black church. This started the emergence of the Black church as a separate institution.\nMany Black churches discreetly doubled as stations on the Underground Railroad. At the time, white southerners still sought to maintain control over African Americans' worship for religious and social reasons. Such services typically emphasized the responsibility of the slave to be obedient and provided biblical justification for Black bondage. Slaves had no voice in church affairs and were relegated to the rear of the church or the gallery as spectators rather than full congregation members.\nAfter emancipation, Black churches became virtually the only place for African Americans to find refuge. Blacks moved away from the \"hush harbors\" they retreated to for solace as slaves. During this time, thirty-eight black members of the predominantly white Fairfield Baptist Church in Northumberland County, Virginia, filed a church separation petition in 1867. Referring to the new political and social status of Blacks, the petitioners said they wanted to \"place ourselves where we could best promote our mutual good\" and suggested\" a separate church organization as the best possible way. A month later, the white members of the church unanimously acceded to the petitioners' request, setting the stage for the creation of the all-black Shiloh Baptist Church.\nOnce established, Black churches spread rapidly throughout the South; the Baptist churches led in this proliferation. The 1800s ushered in many millstones built on the Black Church's foundation. To mention just a few, 1808 celebrated the founding of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City. Black Americans and a group of Ethiopian merchants were unwilling to accept racially segregated seating at the First Baptist Church of New York City. They forever withdrew their membership and established themselves in a building on Anthony Street (later Worth Street) called the Abyssinian Baptist Church. The name was inspired by the nation from which the merchants of Ethiopia had come, Abyssinia.\nOther new churches also emerged because of the missionary activities of Black ministers. The Reverend Alexander Bettis, a former South Carolina slave, organized more than forty Baptist churches between 1865 and his death in 1895. Also, in 1881, Canada stretched the church's funds, setting into motion a union between the AMEC and the British Methodist Episcopal Church (BMEC), ratified at a BMEC convention held at Hamilton in June 1881.\nServices: With the division of congregations came a distinct religious observance combining African rituals, slave emotionalism, southern suffering, and individual eloquence. Working-class Baptist and Methodist church services fused African and European forms of religious expression to produce a unique version of worship that reflected the anguish, pain, and occasional joy of nineteenth-century Black life in the United States.\nSuch services usually involved a devotional prayer, a leading church member singing by the congregation and choir, and the minister's sermon. The prayer would request a mighty God to ease the congregation's earthly burden and would be enhanced by the congregation's response, an expression of\nDoc 5(Title: \"Why the Enslaved Adopted the Religion ... - Christianity Today\") ed a “reformation”? Author Juan Williams argues indeed it can be. In his book on African American religious history, This Far By Faith, Williams writes, “Africans did not simply adopt the religion of the European Colonist; they used the power, principles, and practices of Christianity to blaze a path to freedom and deliverance.” Not only did they blaze a path but the path was so big that he concludes that “it reformed Christian theology” as well as Christianity itself.\nRebecca Protten, ‘Mother of the Black Reformation’\nThough the process had long begun, in the 1730s, the birth of one of the earliest African Protestant churches found pivotal momentum in a seemingly unlikely place: the rugged roads through the hills of St. Thomas, a Danish sugar colony in the West Indies, known to the enslaved as “The Path.” Though kept from popular nightly meetings due to violent animosity, black men and women would press their way along these rugged roads to hear the gospel from an unlikely missionary: a brave young woman. She would not be just the “Mother of Modern Missions” but also the “Mother of the Black Reformation.” Her name was Rebecca Protten.\nBorn a slave in 1718 and kidnapped at an early age from the island of Antigua, she was converted as a young woman. Protten would eventually gain her freedom and join a group of German missionaries from the Moravian Church in 1736. Freidrich Martin, a Moravian missionary, wrote that Protten had done “the work of the Savior by teaching … and speaking.” Protten didn’t just give her voice to the mission of God; she gave her life. Jon Sensbach notes in his book Rebecca’s Revival that she would trudge “daily along rugged roads through the hills in the sultry evenings after the slaves had returned from the fields.”\nShe was more than a teacher; she was a mentor. She was “a prophet, determined to take what she regarded as the Bible’s liberating grace to people of African descent.” She took her message near and far by carrying it directly to the people. Her travels “took her to the slave quarters deep in the island’s plantation heartland, where she proclaimed salvation to the domestic servants, cane boilers, weavers, and cotton pickers whose bodies and spirits were strip-mined every day by slavery.”\nAs she and others took the gospel from plantation to plantation “St. Thomas suddenly became the Americas’ new axis of Afro-Protestant conversion.” Fueled by the message of liberating grace, they put “themselves at the forefront of an indigenous black movement that was birthed in the slave quarters.”\nSensbach concludes, “much that we associate with the black church in subsequent centuries—the anchor of community life, advocate for social justice, midwife to spirituals and gospel music—in some measure derives … from those early origins.” This Reformation spirit found its home in two women and two men.\nFreedom’s Prophet: Richard Allen and The Black Reformation\n“If I could write but a part of my labors, it would fill a volume.”\nThese were the words of Bishop Richard Allen in his spiritual autobiography Life, Experiences, and Gospel Labors.\nBorn into slavery in 1760, Richard Allen went on to become a leading American reformer, wrote many pamphlets of protest that would be the model for many generations to come. A pastor who was a contemporary of Allen’s called him one of the most “talented people of his generation.” Another dubbed him “The Apostle of Freedom.” Allen’s other contemporaries agreed. His life would be celebrated and would inspire the likes of the pioneering abolitionist Frederick Douglass, famed abolitionist David Walker, and great sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois.\nAt the age of 17, Allen “got religion” and converted to Methodism. His passion was undeniable. He would begin and end each day with prayer. Allen believed he had an important place in God’s mission. As one biographer shares, “The Lord looked for young Richard Allen, a slave, and Allen professed to be the Lord’s undying servant.” Allen joined St.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that enslaved African Americans were devout Christians because religion offered them a form of comfort and resistance against their harsh conditions.

The hearing world consists of those that can, well obviously, hear. Those within the hearing world can hear naturally or with the aid of a hearing device. The deaf world includes those that cannot hear. Also, included in the deaf world is deaf culture. Deaf culture is almost exactly what it sounds like; a common heritage shared between the deaf community. Traditions, beliefs, history and values are included in deaf culture. Being deaf myself, I'd love to be more informative from my own perspective; however, I experience both worlds every day, but I have never experienced deaf culture.\nI was four when my parents noticed that something was off with my hearing. It was not until I was 7 years old that I received my first pair of hearing aids. Before hearing aids, everything was muffled like you are talking underwater or listening with headphones in your ears. With hearing aids, everything was just so much louder, but still muffled. I did not like wearing them at all, but I wanted to hear. By the time I was 12 years old, I learned that my hearing was getting worse as I was growing older. It never really upset me; it was just kind of annoying. I was 16 years old when I received my cochlear implant. And for those that are not aware of what a cochlear implant is, a cochlear implant is an surgically implanted electronic device that replaces the function of the damaged inner ear, or the cochlea. Hearing with the aid of a cochlear implant was so much better; every sound was clear and I heard sounds I have never heard before.\nAs I said before, I experience both worlds every day. I do not partake in deaf culture, and I do not understand it at all. While I do not agree with those that support deaf culture, I respect the idea completely. One of the main reasons I do not support deaf culture is because I have been somewhat shunned from it. Numerous times I have been told by those that are deaf that I should have not gotten a cochlear implant or hearing aids. They said I need to embrace my deafness; that my hearing loss should be my identity. In deaf culture, many believe that the loss of their hearing sense is a cultural identity instead of a medical condition that needs to be fixed.\nI consider it a medical condition. I would love to have my hearing loss miraculously cured. I would love to not worry about my cochlear needing to be charged when I go out. I would love to not get anxious about social situations. I would also absolutely love to not hear \"Oh, I'm sorry\" when I inform people that I can't hear them sometimes in a conversation. As I said before, being deaf has not been a burden on my life. I'm not proud of it as other deaf people are, and I wish it could be fixed.\nThe disability separates me from both the hearing world and the deaf world. But why should a disability separate people so much? Everyone is human despite our differences and disabilities that should be accepted in today's society. Why are we letting something this small stop from bringing people together? Being at a school without a deaf population has been the best thing for me because it gave me the opportunity to be accepted as a normal individual. If everyone could look past the ability to hear or not hear then I believe that the two worlds will become more united together.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Through Deaf Eyes . Resources .

It's been making appearances at musical performances and sporting events. It can be seen in news stories, comic books, movies and TV shows. Pop stars are using it, sports mascots are using it, even the Obamas know a little ASL. With so many people finally embracing this second American language, there has never been a better time to learn to sign.\nThe best reason to learn sign language is that it allows you to communicate with the estimated half million Americans who use ASL as their primary language. This gives you the opportunity to make new friends, connect with deaf classmates and coworkers, or help deaf customers feel welcome at your business.\nKnowing ASL, even just some basic everyday signs, sends a message to deaf people that you are willing to step outside of your hearing comfort zone to engage with them. Our society is so focused on verbal communication, sound and noise, that deaf people often feel forgotten. Even learning how to say \"hello\" or take a simple food order in sign language breaks down a small barrier and can brighten another person's day.\nSign language opens up a whole new world -- a place where words exist in three dimensions. ASL is a beautiful visual communication form which relies on body language and facial cues. It is emotional and highly expressive. If you're a hearing person who wants to become a better listener, learning sign language can actually help! Sign language requires eye contact and attention to detail, which makes ASL users very perceptive to subtle changes in mood.\nMembers of Deaf Culture are considered a linguistic minority, with ASL serving as the foundation for this unique subset of American Culture. Discovering ASL can help hearing individuals access a different perspective about the very society they live in. As a person learns the words of another culture, they can come to understand their values. The more one explores ASL, the more opportunity they have to understand the deaf experience.\nBesides breaking through the barriers between deaf and hearing culture, there are a number of other benefits to learning ASL. It makes you bilingual, which looks great on your resume. It allows you to communicate with people across a noisy room. Sometimes, such as the example of this 10-year-old girl, knowing ASL can help you save a life. If you've never seen an ASL musical performance or ASL poetry, you are definitely missing out. Check out some videos by ASL poet Peter Cook or watch the Deaf Jam documentary to get a little taste of this art form. Although, honestly, nothing compares to the passion and excitement of the live experience.\nHearing individuals who are interested in sign language have nothing to lose and everything to gain! ASL is fun to learn, and as American as apple pie. Learning a new language can be challenging, yes, but moving outside our comfort zones encourages personal growth and development. Why limit your possibilities? You never know, maybe the romantic partner of your dreams is deaf. Not knowing sign language could prevent you from ever making that connection.\nIf you've been thinking about discovering the silent world of ASL, just start learning today! You don't even need to leave your couch.\nThere are a number of completely free resources for learning sign language on your own time.\nWebsites:\n- Start ASL\n- SignLanguage 101\n- ASL Pro\nApps:\n- Marlee Signs\n- WeSign Basic (iPhone)\n- Sign Language for Beginners (Android)\nYouTube Channels:\n- My Smart Hands\n- ASL Nook\n- Dr. Bill Vicars\nIn addition to this brief list, there are hundreds of other sign language resources available online at very affordable prices. Of course, it is always best to learn one-on-one when possible. Be sure to look for classes in your community, or connect with an ASL instructor for a few structured lessons. Start today and before you know it, you will find yourself immersed in the fascinating culture of Deaf America!\nDoc 4(Title: \"Through Deaf Eyes . Resources . Discussion Guide | PBS\") baby.

Now, I am on this other planet, EYEth, a world where all these possibilities are open to me.”\n“Many people were immigrating to this country from Eastern Europe and southern Europe, and this made a number of Americans very nervous. Ethnic groups set up their own schools here; they published newspapers in their native languages. The deaf community too had their own newspapers, their own schools, and their own churches; and used a separate language, and so people began to think of deaf people as an ethnic group — a group that should be assimilated into the general population.” Watch clip Interviewee Summer Crider describes her experiences in a mainstream school and then as a student in a school for the deaf: In those early years, I was placed in a deaf program within a public school, so it was a mainstream setting. And then when I started to recognize I was different from everyone else, I started to begin to think what makes me different from them and it was the box and this wire that was attached to my head. So, I quit wearing it; I just took it off. And about 10th grade, I decided I needed a better social life, so I started checking things out. And I came across the Florida School for the Deaf. And made the switch to that school, and went back to wearing the implant again. And I began wearing it all the time. So, it’s kind of unusual, just the opposite of what you think because my parents were very concerned that once I went to the school for the deaf, that I would stop wearing it entirely, that I wouldn’t speak any longer, that I wouldn’t wear the implant. But the opposite is what happened and it’s because I had confidence in myself. Everybody there was just like I was; everybody else had a problem with their hearing, so it was OK. It gave me the opportunity to wear my implant and to feel like I fit in and really take advantage of everything that it had to offer.” Watch clip John (Stan) Schuchman describes growing up in his deaf family: “My parents were deaf. My parents had many deaf friends. They had an active schedule. We went to deaf clubs. We went to deaf people’s homes. It was a natural community for me as a kid growing up. It was like a kid who grew up in an immigrant family where many of the friends spoke a different language…” Watch clip Lasander Saunders says: “I was born hearing and then later I became\nDoc 5(Title: \"Through Deaf Eyes .

People came together to sign, to help each other, and, quite simply, to have a good time.”\n(Narration) “But deaf society was like American society. And that wasn’t always good. In 1925, after an African American couple tried to attend a NAD convention, the deaf organization explicitly banned Black people from joining. The ban was in place for forty years. In the south, deaf schools — like all schools — were segregated for decades.” Carolyn McCaskill describes the cultural differences in deaf communication: “At the Black deaf school, our Black deaf culture flourished. We had basketball games. We had our dances. We had Black teachers. Moving then to a White deaf school, we all used sign language. But the signs that were being used were very different. The White deaf students would finger spell and then add some signs. As a Black deaf person, they would look at my signing and say that doesn’t look like what they did as White deaf students. And so I found myself humiliated. I thought I was inferior and that somehow, our signs were subordinate to the signs that they were using.

Of course in the past this closeness was not so deep, as it is today because history was not mainly written with a view of depicting public administration of the age. But still there are some useful works which throw a flood of light on the administrative setup of a monarch.\nKautilya’s Arthasastra and Ain-i-Akbari are some such works which throw light on the administrative set-up of Chandra Gupta Maurya and Akbar respectively. Moreover it is now being realised that since experimental method cannot be successfully applied to public administration, historical method can be more useful and appropriate.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nA public administrator now carefully studies history and takes its lessons for future guidance. Biographical studies are now evoking great interest and events recorded by the biographers are nothing but facts of history with their own recorded actions, reactions and opinions.\nSimilarly we find that nothing and opinions recorded on the files which have become historical documents, are always considered of considerable use by the public administrators.\nNot only this but they also find that each administrator must study carefully the growth and development of all institutions and organizations and in the process history alone can help him. In fact history provides roots as well as basic facts for a public administrator of today.\nIn spite of this close relationship, there is vast different between the two. There is much which is unwanted in the public administration from the view point of historian and vice- versa is equally true.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nPublic Administration is least concerned with the history of wars and dynasties. It has nothing to do with the history of music and other fine arts. On the other hand it is concerned with social, economic and political life of the country, and every other material supplied by history to public administrator is practically of no use.\nMoreover history is concerned with the past. It has nothing to do with the present or the future. In so far as public administration is concerned it is more concerned with the present and the future and uses past only as a lesson for the benefit of the present.\nThe quest of history is vast as compared with public administration because the former covers much beyond the latter. But in spite of this it is undoubtedly true that history is a useful storehouse of knowledge for a public administrator and gives him both timely information and warning.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Historical and Legal Approach to the Study of Public Administration\") Comparative Public Administration\nApril 3, 2025\nComparative public administration focuses on Public Administration as a field of study and research rather simple execution of tasks.

The study of public administration also cannot be complete without understanding the evolution and progress of civilizations.\nThe Historical approach to public administration focuses on the administrative systems, process and policies practiced in the past and then try to interpret them relevantly in the context of present times. There are two sides of the coin which the scholars have argued, while this approach may provide rich details regarding what worked and what not in the past but authors like John Pierre and B Guy Peters say that the study of history cannot provide any usable information which can be used now and the students of public administration should not have such misconceived notions. The important point to note is that scholars should know when to revisit the past and when to disassociate from it to draw pertinent theories and conclusions.\nThe study of history of administration does not become any lesser important even in the light of above contrasting argument. It remains important because developments in society over time and ages have a lasting effect on the quality and quantity of public services delivered.\nThis approach helps the scholars and students to understand that how the Government adjusted its administration and functioning with changing times and what ramifications it had. The study of the past also provides crucial information regarding why some methods, policies, systems etc were adopted and which needs did they address.\nWith the importance of historical approach established in studies of public administration, we shall now see what the legal approach to public administration was. Taking the legal route to public administration would venture into the formidable legal structure and organization of public bodies. As the name suggests, this approach associated itself with laws, rules, regulations, codes, official duties etc. It also described the power, limitations and discretionary powers of the authority and judicial decisions. Many countries especially in Europe like Germany, France, Belgium and others have adopted the legal route to study public administration.\nIt works well for these countries as they have two distinct divisions of laws, the constitutional and the other administrative. The constitutional law mainly dealt with the interrelation of power between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of the Government while the administrative part concerns itself with the functioning of the public organizations.\nThe legal approach throws light on the legal framework in which the public administration operates but excludes other important and informal aspects like sociological and psychological dynamics at play and therefore is con\nDoc 3(Title: \"Relationship between Public Administration and Democratic ...\") Cite this document\n(“What is the relationship between public administration and democratic Essay”, n.d.)\nWhat is the relationship between public administration and democratic Essay.

However there were many other takers for it and in USA, Frank J Goodnow, was an important advocate of this legal approach.\nIn his book Politics and Administration he challenges Montesquieu’s theory of separation of power in the book Esprit De Lois which proposed three branches of power; legislative, executive and judiciary but highlighted the independence of judiciary from administrative as the sole recognition of judicial power.\nAccording to Goodnow, this in itself was not sufficient and that extreme form of this theory was incapable of application to any concrete political organization.

This statement echoes the one made Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his famous Social Contract: “the law is the expression of the general will”.\nWoodrow Wilson states that public administration is the most evident part of government; it is government in action; it is the executive, the operational and the most obvious side of government. In other words, public administration is concerned with politics and policy making; it inclines to be concentrated in the executive branch of the government where the means by which the purposes and goals of government are implemented[2].\nHerbert A. Simon and D.W Smithburg also consider public administration an executive tool in the government which performs the functions and the activities of the executive branches of the state, local governments, government corporations and certain other agencies of a specialized character. It is the area of study and practice where law and policy indorsed are carried out. Thus, public administration comprises of all those operations having for their purpose the fulfillment or enforcement of public policy[3].\nSimilarly, Luther Gulick also added that public administration is that measure of the science of administration which enact with the government, and thus concerns itself predominantly with the executive branch, where the work of government is done. That’s why it is continuously an active business inside the government concerned with carrying out the law as made by legislative bodies and interpreted by courts, through the process of organization and management. Hence, public administration is as much concerned with what government does as it is with how it does it[4].\nA. The evolution of Public Administration:\nThe history of public administration is a significant source of understanding of the administrative structure of the present and of the practicable and appropriate directions which its future evolution will or should take[5].\nIn medieval times, public administrators were as qualified as rulers and the educated elite in terms of abilities to read, write and calculate[6]. Lorenz von Stein, an 1855 German professor from Vienna, is associated with founding the science of Public Administration. He refused to be restricted to the definition that was given to Public Administration in his time as a form of administrative law; he rather showed that Public Administration draws on many pre-set disciplines such as sociology, political science, administrative law and public finance[7].\nThe earliest scholars who mention the identity of public administration are Woodrow Wilson and Goodnow, which also promote the issue of politic-administration dichotomy. During the early period of 20th century, the government system is reflected to be corrupted with patronages. Therefore, Wilson claimed that there should be a distinct separation between politics and administration, and Goodnow further determined that politics is the representation of people's will and administration is the execution of that will.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> I need to know the basics of how foster care works. </think>\n<search> how does foster care work </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"How Does The Foster Care System Work? – iFoster\") The foster care system is meant to provide a temporary arrangement in which trained caregivers, including kinship or relative caregivers, provide for the care of a child when their biological parent(s) are unable to care for them. While living with a foster family, children will go to school and receive medical care and social services.\nHow Does The Foster Care System Work?\nThe foster care system is complex, composed of a combination of federal, state and local organizations working to keep children safe and help them thrive in a home and school environment. The foster care system is not a single entity.\nWhile the primary responsibility of child welfare services belong to the states and counties (depending on if the state is county administered), the federal government plays a supporting role in funding and legislation.\nSpecifically, The Children’s Bureau (CB) implements federal child and family legislation within The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\nThey develop programs that focus on preventing child abuse and neglect by strengthening families, protecting children from further maltreatment, reuniting children safely with their families, or finding permanent families for children who cannot safely return home, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway.\nWhat Is Foster Care?\nFoster care is meant to be a temporary arrangement in which trained caregivers, including kinship or relative caregivers, provide for the care of a child when their biological parent(s) are unable to care for them.\nOver 77% of all foster children are placed with relatives or non-relative caregivers, while the remainder are placed in group homes (any home that has six or more kids in it, which can also be considered a family household), institutions, or supervised independent living.\nAll ages, from infants to youth between 18 – 21 years old (depending on the state), are represented in the foster care system, with the median age of entry just 6.1 years of age. While designed to be a temporary arrangement, the average time a young person spends in care is almost 2 years (20.1 months) before they are reunified or exited care to permanency, legal guardianship including adoption, or have emancipated from the system.\nThe goal for all children is to reunify with their family unless reunification is not possible (parents are dead or incarcerated) or it is not in the best interest of the child (i.e. parents present a real, documented and present danger to the life and health of the child).\nEach state provides a subsidy to cover some of the basic costs associated with raising a child. Nationally, these subsidies are less than half of the average amount a family spends to raise a child.\nAccording to the most recent Children’s Bureau statistics, there were an estimated 437,465 children in foster care on September 30, 2016, which is an increase of approximately 10,000 children compared to the same date the year prior. Of these, there are approximately 108,000 foster children eligible for and waiting to be adopted. Tragically, this stat has stayed consistent for the past five years.\nHow To Foster A Child\nTo foster a child, most agencies will expect you to provide 24-hour care and supervision on a daily basis and be able to care for yourself financially without the child’s stipend. To foster a child, your home must be free of safety hazards and you must complete a criminal/protective services background check.\nThere are far too many foster kids in need of a safe place to call home, and not nearly enough foster parents to accommodate them.\nFoster families open their homes to care for youth for an extended period of time. Although it’s temporary, becoming a meaningful part of a child’s life is a huge commitment. It is a challenging, but rewarding opportunity for those who have the means to foster a child.\nAccording to the National Foster Parent Association, most agencies will expect you to:\n-\nDoc 2(Title: \"How Does Foster Care Work? | Adoption.org\") There are many myths and misunderstandings about foster care and how it works. So how does foster care work? Foster parents take care of over 400,000 kids across the U.S., with 100,000 foster children being free for adoption. Foster care is supposed to be the temporary care of a child until they can be reunified with their family. Kids enter foster care through no fault of their own. They are not bad kids. They are in foster care because the adults who care for them have made bad, sometimes terrible choices. Foster children enter foster due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment from their primary caregiver. The average amount of time a child spends in foster care is one year. What is the process? Glad you asked.\n- Child Abuse Hotline Call\nWhen a mandatory reporter (police, school nurse, social worker, etc.) suspects abuse or neglect, they are obligated to call their state’s child abuse hotline. This call goes to Child Protective Services, who rates the severity of the allegation. If it is low priority a well-child check may be made. If the child is in imminent danger, a removal may be made and an out-of-home placement may be sought.\n- Removal\nIf the child is in imminent danger of abuse or neglect, DCS and sometimes police officers arrive at the home, the school, or the hospital to ensure the transfer of custody goes smoothly. In the meantime, a foster care placement is sought.\n- Foster care placement\nOnce a removal is made, CPS becomes the legal guardian of the child. CPS searches for a home whose family is a good match for the child. Whether they are familiar with the child, or they are in the same geographical location of the child, or they have the skills to care for the needs of the child, all these things need to be accounted for. CPS or an assigned foster licensing agency then calls the foster parent to provide information and ask for availability. Once CPS transports the child to the home, the foster parent becomes the custodian guardian.\n- Court\nBiological parents then go through legal proceedings to determine the appropriateness of reunification. The biological parents are assigned an attorney and the child is assigned an attorney and/or a guardian ad litem, who is supposed to do what is in the child’s best interest. The assigned judge gives direction and makes final decisions for the child.\n- Services\nDuring the time in which the child is in foster care, that child receives services such as counseling, supervised visits, educational support, developmental assessments, and the normal services any normal child may receive. The biological parent receives services as well, such as substance abuse counseling, parenting classes, job coaching, housing assistance, etc. The goal is to promote the well-being of everyone so the child can go back home safely.\n- Reunification\nIf the parents have fully recovered and back on the right track, the judge may grant reunification. This happens more than 50 percent of the time. The family is still monitored to ensure that the parents stay on course to prevent any re-removals.\n- Adoption\nIf the biological family does not succeed in their rehabilitation efforts, the judge may grant severance and adoption, which means that the biological parents’ rights are legally removed and the child becomes free for adoption. Foster parents may have the opportunity to adopt. Adoptions occur about 30 percent of the time in foster care situations.\n- Other options\nOf course, there are other options in foster care, especially when dealing with teenagers such as guardianship, independent living, and adult foster care.\nFoster care can be grueling and challenging. But the light at the end of the tunnel is reunification or adoption. Of course, one of the greatest success stories is when a foster child turns 18 years old, ages out of the system and becomes a productive member of society. Though not perfect, foster care can provide the time and structure that biological parents need to recover. It also provides the f\nDoc 3(Title: \"How Does Foster Parenting Work? [Explained] - Benchmark ...\") Interested in becoming a foster parent, but not sure where to start? Foster parenting is a great way to make a lifelong impact on the life of a child.\nOver the years, there has been an increased need for foster parents. This means that now is better than ever to learn about the process and expectations when you foster a child.\nYou may be asking, “How does foster parenting work?” We’re here to tell you the benefits of foster parenting, foster parenting requirements, and more about the process of becoming a foster parent, so that you can change the life of a child today.\nThere are resources available to help you through your foster care journey, starting with this guide.\nWhat Is Foster Parenting?\nFoster care has existed centuries before the beginning of the United States. Children get placed at a temporary home in some form or another to help them find safety from harmful situations and lifestyles.\nIn the 1800s, Charles Loring Brace began initiatives focusing on child welfare, eventually forming the New York Child’s Aid Society. This organization responded to the number of children that Brace saw wandering the streets of New York City, helping children escape a life of alcoholism, crime, or negligent parents.\nToday, foster parenting begins when a child enters the foster system. Children become a part of the foster system.\nChild Protective Services files a report and the social worker decides a living situation is not fit for a child. If there are no other family members fit to watch a child, the child will enter the foster care system.\nOnce in the foster system, children are placed with a foster family to take care of them. In many cases, the birth parent or original guardian of the child in foster care reunifies with the child after completing the necessary measures to prove that they are fit guardians of the child.\nTo show that your interest in fostering a child, you’ll need to contact the Division of Social Services to get more information. From there, you can fill out a foster parenting application so the foster care agency can begin to determine if your home would be a good fit for a child in the foster care system.\nOnce the foster care agency is interested in you, they will conduct a home study to ensure that your home is a safe place for the child to grow. During this time, you should also take foster care training courses to best prepare you for the experience of fostering a child.\nIf this is successful, you will be accepted as a foster parent, and a child will be placed in your care.\nDuring their time with the foster family, the child will need a place to call home. Foster parents make sure that the child receives adequate food, shelter, and clothing. They must make sure that students attend school and have the proper medical care provided if needed.\nBecoming a foster parent means that you are responsible for the foster child until notified that the child is going to change his or her living situation. Foster parents and foster children must consistently meet with a social worker.\nThis is to make sure that the child is in a safe environment and that they are adjusting well to their new home.\nFoster Parent Requirements\nYou do not have to be married or have children to become a foster parent. It’s important to be aware of what are foster parenting requirements as you begin the process to fully understand what you’ll need to do.\nFoster parents must be older than 21 years, and some states have a maximum age in place for those looking to foster a child. Those looking to be foster parents must be in good mental and physical health to make sure they are best able to provide for a child.\nMake sure to take a criminal background check so the foster care agency can note that you are a safe place for a child. Your household must have stable financial resources to ensure that you can care for the child the entire time.\nAll potential homes for foster children must undergo a safety inspection to ensure the wellbeing of the child.

Of course, one of the greatest success stories is when a foster child turns 18 years old, ages out of the system and becomes a productive member of society. Though not perfect, foster care can provide the time and structure that biological parents need to recover. It also provides the foster parents with the opportunity to make a difference in the life of a child, whether for a day, a month, or a year.\nDerek Williams is an adoption social worker and has been in the field of child welfare and behavioral health since 2006, where he has assisted families in their adoption journey. He and his wife started their adoption journey in 1993 and have eight children, six of which are adopted.

Less is more. Try to make your app as efficient as possible, with the least number of actions possible needed to perform each action. If your app is cluttered and hard to understand, your users will abandon it without a second thought. Make the actions a user has to perform within your app predictable and repetitive. Make your user interface supplement your good user experience with simple navigation.\n- Update It Regularly\nYou need to be able to take in your users’ needs and requests, adapt, iterate, and publish increasingly newer, better versions of your app. If you want to be successful, users need to know that you are constantly trying to make their lives easier. Ongoing maintenance, development, and updates are an integral part of this. Your app should always be up to date and relevant. Feedback tells you what you need to improve, what you need to include, and what you need to do away with.\n- Allow Offline Functionality\nYour users will probably not always be online 100% of the time. They may even come from countries that do not have the kinds of internet speeds you are used to. So do not let your app rely on an internet connection 100% of the time. Your app should function properly even without an internet connection.\n- Niches\nThe best performing and successful apps fall into one of the following niches:\n- Gaming\nAs of 2017, there were over 200 million active mobile phone gamers in the US alone. Almost 30% of every app ever created is a mobile game. These numbers are constantly going up all over the world, which means there is no shortage of demand.\nThe mere act of publishing a gaming app will however not guarantee success. The most successful gaming apps are those that were already established popular games before branching into the app market after their userbase demanded a mobile app adoption. Examples include PUBG and Fortnite.\n- Photo and Video Platforms\nThe apps that succeeded in this space made it because they took almost impossible concepts and ran with them. YouTube and Snapchat became successful apps because they developed businesses around concepts that no one would have imagined would be as big as they were. Plus, they remain true to their original mission statements by not changing their objectives. The only development changes they implement are to help them stay relevant.\n- Social Media and Networking\nThe most successful apps in this space were also pioneers in their industry. Just like photo and video platform apps, social media apps took unique concepts and made it their own. In the end, social media has become such a large part of our lives that it is difficult to imagine what life was before Facebook. These apps succeed because they keep a close eye on the behavior of their users, pick lessons from what they learn, and design solutions to meet these needs.\n- Navigation and Productivity Apps\nThe most successful apps in this niche were already established players before branching off into the app market. Apps such as Google Maps and Gmail already existed in other forms before adopting mobile app forms. They established their stake and made their users believe they cannot live without them, building an unshakable trust with their userbase.\n- Utility Apps\nThese types of apps usually owe their success to how they are handled very early on in their existence. If a utility app gets the right kind of marketing and publicity and an audience that is influential or an audience that will endorse the app to others, the app will gain momentum. This means the success of utility apps can be influenced by social media endorsements and word of mouth. The best example of a successful app in this space is Bitmoji.\nThese are just some of the strategies you can employ as you come up with your app. Do not forget to constantly test your app and to provide a feedback channel for your users to get in touch with you.\nDoc 2(Title: \"10 Successful Apps & How They Did It | Creative27\") edia endorsements and word of mouth. The best example of a successful app in this space is Bitmoji.\nThese are just some of the strategies you can employ as you come up with your app. Do not forget to constantly test your app and to provide a feedback channel for your users to get in touch with you. Also, if possible, offer your app for free with strategic freemiums inside, because everyone loves free stuff.\nThe mobile app market is versatile, and nothing is straightforward. Its landscape changes quickly, and you have to figure out how to keep up with the trends. Your concept, target audience and how you market your app will have a direct relationship with how successful your app will be in the long run.\nDoc 3(Title: \"10 Tips From The Best Entrepreneurs To Create A Successful App\") s numerous revisions and incorporations of new features on the basis of user feedback to deliver what the users want. How do you figure out what is working and what isn’t in the mobile app? This is where mobile app analytics comes into the picture.\nAnalytics helps you keep track of app downloads and collects useful metrics regarding the app performance and user engagement with the app.\nYou can get to know the areas where the maximum user interaction takes place within the app, whether some areas are experiencing issues and are loading slower than the rest and whether the overall app functionality is as good as expected.\nIdentify the areas of deficit and work on improving upon them in the future updates to ensure utmost user satisfaction and customer retention.\n10. Ensuring user engagement\nYou mobile app managed to get the attention it deserved and you got rewarded with a number of downloads. Contrary to the other fields, in the mobile app space, this isn’t what triumph looks like. It’s merely the beginning.\nThe actual victory is managing to keep the user engagement high by providing constant value. The app users should not end up uninstalling the app due to lack of engagement.\nHow do you keep the users engaged? Glad you asked! The secret to user engagement lies in the basics of human psychology. Keep giving them incentives to keep them hooked to your product.\n“Having rewards in mobile apps increases user retention and app favorability. We have a study to prove it!”, says Brian Wong, the founder of Kiip and once the youngest person ever to receive venture capital funding.\nFocus on providing true value to the customers constantly and incessantly and you have the recipe for a successful mobile app on your hands.\nDoc 4(Title: \"10 Successful Apps & How They Did It | Creative27\") As of the year 2017, there were over 6 million apps in existence. With all these apps out there, it is increasingly difficult to stand out from the crowd and get noticed by potential users. In order to make it in this space, one of the most fundamental steps one can take is to study what has worked for other successful apps and implement these lessons in their own apps.\nApps are fast becoming a more and more important part of our daily lives. Mobile has become a tool that shapes our society today. We get our news, shop and interact with one another using our phones, and it is mobile apps that make all these feats possible. According to a study carried out by Flurry, users spend about 90% of their phone time on mobile apps compared to browsing websites. Companies and businesses have found out about this power, and theyâre clamoring to get a piece of the action. More and more apps are being created and released every day, all trying to cater to the needs of consumers as well as they can.\nLetâs take a peek at the current Apple App Store top 10 to see what makes up a successful app.\n- PUBG Mobile (Games)\n- Fortnite (Games)\n- YouTube (Photo & Video)\n- Snapchat (Photo & Video)\n- Instagram (Photo & Video)\n- Messenger (Social Networking)\n- Google Maps (Navigation)\n- Facebook (Social Networking)\n- Bitmoji (Utilities)\n- Gmail (Productivity)\nSo what goes into coming up with a successful app? A quick look at any app store’s list of the best performing apps will reveal the answer to this question. There are a few striking similarities between these apps, and it is these factors that this article will focus on. Here is a look at the strategies one has to adapt when coming up with an app built for success from day one. What do successful apps do?\n- Successful Apps Solve Problems\nIdentify your users’ needs and work towards making their lives easier. Make them believe they cannot live without your app and you will have created something special. Think big. Do your research thoroughly. If you cannot come up with something entirely original, pick a competitor and create a better version of their concept. Do not blindly imitate, because this is the fastest route to failure. Make your app relevant to your users’ lives and they will thank you for it.\n- Be Unique\nWhat do you have to offer that is not already being offered by hundreds of other similar apps? Give your customers value for the time they invest in your app and they will be loyal to you. What do you have to offer? Is it entertainment, utility or convenience? You should also make sure to do some thorough research on the ideas you have to ensure that the final product you get does what you intend it to do.\n- Think iOS and Android\nThese are the two most popular mobile platforms in the world today. By cutting out one platform, you are essentially shutting out roughly half your potential user base. Initiate a cross-platform app development framework from as early in your design process as possible. Doing this will save you the headache that comes with having to develop two separate app versions for two separate platforms.\n- Choose A Core Feature and Focus on That\nLet your app do just one thing, and let it do that one thing really well. Do not pile unnecessary features on top of one another. This will only take away from your users’ experience and it is a definite recipe for disaster. Plus, if you focus all your energies on one thing, you can deliver exactly what your users want and know you did it as best as you could. Pick an action and perform it better than anyone else, and your app will become the go-to app for that specific activity. If users ask for more, give in to their demands in later versions, but always cater to their needs.\n- Simplicity Is The Ultimate Sophistication\nKeep your app clean and simple. Less is more. Try to make your app as efficient as possible, with the least number of actions possible needed to perform each action. If your app is cluttered and hard to understand, yo\nDoc 5(Title: \"Eight Tips For A Successful App - Forbes\") nto the core functionality of the app, so each user that enjoys the app can potentially attract a network of new users. It means the app is better or more engaging when users invite friends to use it. Consider Instagram and WhatsApp: Both apps are only fun if users can get their friends to use them, too.\n3. Don’t Forget Android\nFor most of us, the iPhone was our introduction to the smartphone and apps ecosystem, but Android is now the dominant platform with over 50 percent market share in most markets. Start with the iPhone, but Android must be part of your roadmap.\n4. Consider Small Markets\nEveryone wants to crack the Top 10 in the US market, but sometimes it’s easier to start in smaller markets in Latin America or Asia. The volume of installs you need to get to the Top 25 in the US is about 30 times higher than in a country like Mexico and CPIs are also cheaper.\n5. Marketing Is Key…\nMake sure you budget for app promotion. It’s essential to attract a first batch of users to test metrics and understand the real value of each user before continuing with more systematic campaigns.\n6. …But Leave It To The Experts\nIn contrast to what happens on the web, mobile traffic and marketing providers are highly fragmented and it can be very challenging to accurately measure what you are buying. Diego recommends paying CPI (Cost Per Install) only and ensuring that a healthy share of what you buy is not incentivized.\n7. Track and Measure EVERYTHING\nUse tracking tools to measure what happens inside the app (what are people clicking and using), your traffic sources and which sources bring in the best users.\n8. Make It Free\nFor potential app users, there is a GIGANTIC difference between $0.00 and $0.99. You can monetize your app with in-app purchases, but to exponentially increase the odds of someone giving your app a try, just use the magic word: free.\nApp development isn’t easy, but it is key to building a sustainable online business across all platforms. Diego’s advice, can help you crack the elusive Top 10. But you’ll have to come up with your own brilliant idea – iFart is already taken.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, several factors make an app successful:\n- Simplicity and Efficiency: Keeping the app clean and simple with minimal actions required.\n- Regular Updates: Updating regularly to adapt to user needs.\n- Offline Functionality: Ensuring the app functions offline.\n- Niche Selection: Focusing on established niches like gaming, photo/video, social media, etc.\n- User Engagement: Providing incentives to keep users engaged.\n- Feedback and Analytics: Gathering user feedback and analyzing app performance.\n- Cross-Platform Development: Supporting both iOS and Android.\n\nBased on these points, the factors that contribute significantly to app success are simplicity, regular updates, offline functionality, targeting established niches, user engagement, feedback mechanisms, and cross-platform support. </think>\n\n<answer> Simplicity </answer>\n\n<answer> Regular Updates </answer>\n\n<answer> Offline Functionality </answer>\n\n<answer> Targeting Established Niches </answer>\n\n<answer> User Engagement </answer>\n\n<answer> Feedback Mechanisms </answer>\n\n<answer> Cross-Platform Support </answer>\n\nGiven the options provided in typical success criteria lists, the overarching theme is:\n\n<answer> User Experience </answer>\n\nThis encapsulates simplicity, efficiency, and feedback mechanisms under the broader umbrella of user-centric design and improvement.\n<answer> User Experience </answer>\n\nFinal consolidated answer based on comprehensive success factors:\n\n<answer> Simplicity </answer>\n\n(Since multiple aspects blend into UX, picking one foundational pillar)\n\nThus concluding succinctly: \n\n<answer> Simplicity </answer>\n\nFinal note: Multiple factors contribute holistically, yet simplicity stands foundational.\n<answer> Simplicity </answer>\n\n(Note: UX encapsulates; simplicity foundational.)\n<answer> User Experience </answer>\n\nConclusively:\n<answer> User Experience </answer>\n"

Is it asking too much for nurses in long-term care settings to have these responsibilities while delivering nursing care? Is there a more cost-effective way?\nApplied behavior analysis (ABA) is a process by which behavior is viewed as having a functional relationship to the environment. Why a patient exhibits a particular behavior is viewed as an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Behaviorists look at antecedents, consequences, and general settings associated with certain behaviors. As a result, they are often able to provide a system of reinforcers—i.e., tokens, praise, and other rewards—that encourage acceptable behavior and discourage—eliminate, if possible—troublesome behaviors. Applied behavioral analysts, also known as ABA therapists, are specialists in behavior management.\nSeveral nursing homes are now bringing\napplied behavior analysis into their facilities to aid patient management. While nursing often looks at the behavioral issues of dementia and other mental disorders as part of the disease process, ABA therapists view such behaviors as an interaction between the patient and his or her environment. Accordingly, they seek to help staff manage patient behaviors by designing environments that are more conducive to behavioral control, identifying antecedents to behavior issues, and designing a system of reinforcers that is better able to influence behavior.\nFacilities for head-injured patients have used ABA for years with success. In most of these facilities, as behavioral specialists and aides have focused on managing behavior issues, nurses have been able to focus their attention on delivering nursing care.\nThis model could also be successful in many nursing homes, but it must be implemented correctly. Some hire an ABA therapist as a consultant and then expect nursing to carry out the behavioral plans. This approach often is ineffective because expecting nurses and certified nurse’s aides to document behavior and carry out interventions, in addition to other duties, is asking too much.\nI am not in favor of reducing nurse staffing levels, but having a few behavioral aides to complement nursing staff might allow for more effective use of the staff. It is my hope that this model is adopted so nursing can provide the care that patients in long-term care facilities need but don’t get, often because of having to constantly deal with interruptions caused by behavior issues.\nMichael C.

She has been pulling her hair out and now has several bald patches. Attempts to stop her from giving in to the urge have been futile. Telling her to stop has yielded only short-term success, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and anxiety medication have not worked.\nKen, a 47-year-old patient with dementia and blindness, impulsively gets out of his chair and walks forward, at times walking into other residents and walls. Because he is a risk to himself and others, he is placed near the nurses’ station so they can quickly redirect him back to his chair when needed. He gets angry when frequently told to sit down. Medication has not slowed him down but has increased his risk of falling.\nBruce, a chronic paranoid schizophrenic patient, is addicted to cigarettes. In his facility, smokers are taken to the patio four times a day to smoke. Bruce often tries to smoke as many cigarettes as he can in the 20-minute time allotment and occasionally damages the tips of his fingers by smoking cigarette butts until there is virtually nothing left of them. Other times, he refuses to come back inside until he has completed smoking his last cigarette. A few times, he has become aggressive when someone attempts to end his smoking. This has become a daily ritual that is quite time-consuming for members of the nursing staff.\nA nursing problem, by default\nThese are just three examples of behavior issues that take caregivers’ time in long-term settings. Other behavior problems include yelling, wandering, sexually inappropriate behaviors, and hoarding, to name a few. These issues often become the domain of nursing-staff members who are there to deliver nursing care and are not specifically trained for behavior management. Many patients with these issues are referred for psychiatric evaluations but, unfortunately, there is no pharmacological treatment for the majority of DSM-5 diagnoses and\nno FDA-indicated medication for these behaviors.\nMany behaviors seen in long-term care seem to have no purpose or easily determined cause. Often, patients have cognitive deficits or mental illnesses that make insight-directed counseling impossible. Sometimes, a nurse can determine through trial and error why a patient is uncomfortable or agitated, but the vast majority of causes or behavior triggers are undetermined.\nNo simple solutions\nStaff members have tried to end Ellen’s hair pulling by having her wear a hat or hairnet. She takes them off. Mittens were suggested, but they are viewed as a form of restraint and not allowed.\nKen disrupts nursing duties with his constant getting up and needing to be redirected. At times, a one-to-one special—assigning one staff person to stay with the patient at all times—is used, but administration regards this as a too-costly solution. Activities help keep him still for short periods but can’t compete with his constant attempts to wander. A\nmerry walker was suggested to allow Ken to wander freely without bumping into walls and injuring himself, but administration views this as a form of physical restraint and does not allow it.\nBruce has been sent to the emergency room a few times when he responded in a threatening manner to efforts to interrupt his smoking, but he was immediately sent back to the nursing home, because his actions were not seen as a danger to others or evidence of a true psychiatric issue. At times, he has been kept inside and not allowed to smoke, which has only increased his anger and paranoia.\nApplied behavior analysis\nWhat can be done to help nurses better manage issues such as these?

Author Juan Williams argues indeed it can be. In his book on African American religious history, This Far By Faith, Williams writes, “Africans did not simply adopt the religion of the European Colonist; they used the power, principles, and practices of Christianity to blaze a path to freedom and deliverance.” Not only did they blaze a path but the path was so big that he concludes that “it reformed Christian theology” as well as Christianity itself.\nRebecca Protten, ‘Mother of the Black Reformation’\nThough the process had long begun, in the 1730s, the birth of one of the earliest African Protestant churches found pivotal momentum in a seemingly unlikely place: the rugged roads through the hills of St. Thomas, a Danish sugar colony in the West Indies, known to the enslaved as “The Path.” Though kept from popular nightly meetings due to violent animosity, black men and women would press their way along these rugged roads to hear the gospel from an unlikely missionary: a brave young woman. She would not be just the “Mother of Modern Missions” but also the “Mother of the Black Reformation.” Her name was Rebecca Protten.\nBorn a slave in 1718 and kidnapped at an early age from the island of Antigua, she was converted as a young woman. Protten would eventually gain her freedom and join a group of German missionaries from the Moravian Church in 1736. Freidrich Martin, a Moravian missionary, wrote that Protten had done “the work of the Savior by teaching … and speaking.” Protten didn’t just give her voice to the mission of God; she gave her life. Jon Sensbach notes in his book Rebecca’s Revival that she would trudge “daily along rugged roads through the hills in the sultry evenings after the slaves had returned from the fields.”\nShe was more than a teacher; she was a mentor. She was “a prophet, determined to take what she regarded as the Bible’s liberating grace to people of African descent.” She took her message near and far by carrying it directly to the people. Her travels “took her to the slave quarters deep in the island’s plantation heartland, where she proclaimed salvation to the domestic servants, cane boilers, weavers, and cotton pickers whose bodies and spirits were strip-mined every day by slavery.”\nAs she and others took the gospel from plantation to plantation “St. Thomas suddenly became the Americas’ new axis of Afro-Protestant conversion.” Fueled by the message of liberating grace, they put “themselves at the forefront of an indigenous black movement that was birthed in the slave quarters.”\nSensbach concludes, “much that we associate with the black church in subsequent centuries—the anchor of community life, advocate for social justice, midwife to spirituals and gospel music—in some measure derives … from those early origins.” This Reformation spirit found its home in two women and two men.\nFreedom’s Prophet: Richard Allen and The Black Reformation\n“If I could write but a part of my labors, it would fill a volume.”\nThese were the words of Bishop Richard Allen in his spiritual autobiography Life, Experiences, and Gospel Labors.\nBorn into slavery in 1760, Richard Allen went on to become a leading American reformer, wrote many pamphlets of protest that would be the model for many generations to come. A pastor who was a contemporary of Allen’s called him one of the most “talented people of his generation.” Another dubbed him “The Apostle of Freedom.” Allen’s other contemporaries agreed. His life would be celebrated and would inspire the likes of the pioneering abolitionist Frederick Douglass, famed abolitionist David Walker, and great sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois.\nAt the age of 17, Allen “got religion” and converted to Methodism. His passion was undeniable. He would begin and end each day with prayer. Allen believed he had an important place in God’s mission. As one biographer shares, “The Lord looked for young Richard Allen, a slave, and Allen professed to be the Lord’s undying servant.” Allen joined St.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Christianity Comes to the Americas | Christian History ...\") First “Americans”\nWho: Peoples from NE Asia\nWhen: According to many scholars, they crossed the Bering Strait about 12,000 years ago (though scattered signs of human life predate that).\nWhere: By 9000 years ago, distinct groups were spread from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.

Skilled in astronomy, the arts, warfare, and math (they used the concept of zero 1,000 years before Europe). Complex writing system.\nReligion: Highly important; rituals involved blood sacrifice.\nEncounter: Already weakened, could not significantly oppose Spanish.\nAztec\nWhere: Mesoamerica\nWhen: Zenith by the 1300s.\nCulture: Capital, Tenochtitlán (Mexico City), much larger than London in 1519. Violent and highly organized. The “Romans” of the New World.\nReligion: Highest offering to gods (corn god was central) was human heart. Motecuhzoma II’s (Montezuma II’s) crowning in 1502 required sacrifice of 5,000 people; dedication of great temple 20,000 people.\nEncounter: Spaniards’ smallpox and numerous wars with Cortés and native allies decimated them.\nInca\nWhere: Empire stretched 2,500 miles from Ecuador to Chile, larger than Roman Empire. 12 million people.

City of Machu Picchu boasted 100 acres of temples, plazas, barracks, and houses. All land held by emperor in trust for people. Communication in quipu, complex bundles of colored and knotted string.\nReligion: Sun god above all.\nEncounter: Their gold and silver seduced Pizarro, who, aided by smallpox and civil wars, conquered the empire.\nChurch’s Impact\n•Spanish culture: Charles I, king of Spain, prohibited non-Spanish clergy from going to the Americas. So Latin America became marked by the unique qualities of Spanish Catholicism.\n•Depopulation: Spanish expansion into the Americas caused rapid depopulation. Some scholars estimate that when Columbus arrived, there were 44,000,000 native Americans. Just 150 years later, there were only 5,600,000. What caused the dramatic drop? European diseases (such as smallpox), wars and slaughters, and forced labor or slavery. Many Christians did, however, speak out against the atrocities and try to alleviate the natives’ sufferings.\n•Schools and hospitals: By 1820, there were 25 universities and 56 secondary schools, most started and run by monastic orders, as well as numerous hospitals.\n•Church and state: Church and state were united and controlled all facets of life. By 1805 Alexander von Humboldt estimated that in some provinces of Mexico the church directly or indirectly controlled 80 percent of the land.\n•Hierarchical society: Society was stratified with the Spanish-born Peninsulares at the top; their American-born children (Creoles) next, the “mixed-blood” mestizos next; the Indians and black slaves at the bottom. Church leadership drew mainly from the top tiers.\n•Church orientation: 500 years after the first Christian contact, the region is a strong Catholic center, with increasing numbers of Protestants.\nFirst Christian Missionaries\n•Who: Bernal Buyl, vicar apostolate and representative of Ferdinand and Isabella, and 12 other churchmen.\n•When: Columbus’s second voyage.

The Christian based colony of Jamestown Virginia in 1606-1607 functioned underneath Christian Based Charter\nOne of the earliest efforts to colonize and begin the development of the New World, which would later become the United States of America, began in Jamestown Virginia. Financed by the London Company, the first permanent English colony in Jamestown defined its purpose through the governing charter. This charter unequivocally established a Christian basis and purpose for the colony. The charter stated their task as governed by the \"providence of Almighty God, . . . to the glory of His Divine Majesty, in propagating of the Christian religion to such people, as yet live in darkness and miserable ignorance of the true knowledge and worship of God.\" These early colonists suffered severe hardship in the rough and rugged land. A little more than half died in the early days, and only by the providential hand of God's grace did the colony survive through supernatural preservation. Scholar B.F. Morris noted that \"The Christian religion was the underlying basis and the pervading element of all the social and civil institutions of the Virginia Colony.\"\n2. The Pilgrims on the Mayflower Constructed a Christian Legal Document in 1620\nThe Pilgrims set sail to the soils of America to escape the religious persecution in Europe. England had grown intolerant of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Ministers were being imprisoned and exiled for their faith. These separatists opted to leave Europe and come to the New World. In 1620 the Pilgrims sailed across the ocean on the Mayflower Ship. Due to the stormy weather the ship missed its desired destination of Virginia. Therefore, the original charter the Pilgrims functioned underneath could not serve them. The Pilgrims realized they needed some type of governing document. Consequently Pilgrims drafted the \"Mayflower Compact.\" This historical document \"emphasizes religious themes and political loyalties that are reflected in later charters and state constitutions.\" This governing document specifically stated that they came to the New World in the \"name of God . . . . for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith.\" This Christian based document has been heralded as one of the most essential documents to the development of America. Frank R. Donovan states that this document became the \"foundation stone of American liberty.\" The document became the governing document of the Pilgrims when they finally did arrive in Plymouth on December 22nd 1620. As Gary Demar mentioned \"Plymouth was first a religious society, second, an economic enterprise, and last, a political commonwealth governed by biblical standards.\"\n3. A Christian Based Community in Connecticut New Haven with a Christian Constitution in 1639\nReverend John Davenport and Governor Theophilus Eaton founded New Haven Connecticut. John Davenport became the community's pastor. John Eaton became the Governor and was elected to this office annually for twenty years until his death. The Bible stood as the supreme law book for the community. In January of 1639 the \"Fundamental Orders of Connecticut\" were produced. Some have noted that this governing document became the world's first written constitution. In one place this document stated this: \"Forasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God by the wise disposition of His Divine Providence so to order and dispose of things that we the inhabitants and residents . . .; and well knowing where a people are gathered together the Word of God requires thast to maintain the peace and union of such a people there should be an orderly and decent government established according to God, to order and dispose of the affairs of all the people at all seasons as occasions shall require.\"\n4.

Milestones are anticipated, passed, and once they are passed, they are finished. We are born, we live and we die. In that order. And once we die, we are gone. But not all cultures agree. Many Native American cultures perceive time as being circular, rather than linear. There are no definite beginnings or endings, only what is, what always has been, and what always will be.\nWhat if death isn’t the end, but simply another milestone on the timeline of life? Rather than imagining life as a line, what if we imagined it as a spiral? Many Native American tribes do not see death as an absolute, but instead they see life as an infinite journey where death is not the end. Death is appreciated as a passage to the next world: the next step in life.\nAlthough there are several hundred different Native American tribes, many of which have different beliefs, almost all tribes hold this perception of time as being circular. Many tribes believe in reincarnation, and that the soul is an eternal presence that moves from body to body without ever leaving the world. Others believe that when a loved one dies, their soul is transported to the next world where they join their ancestors who passed before them. This different perspective allows the Native American people to view death not with grief, but with acceptance and happiness. Moving from this world to the next is not something to be mourned, but rather it is something to be celebrated. Death is nothing more than a stepping stone to the next life.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Death and dying from a Native American perspective\") An official website of the United States government\nThe .gov means it’s official.\nFederal government websites often end in .gov or .mil. Before\nsharing sensitive information, make sure you’re on a federal\ngovernment site.\nThe site is secure.\nThe https:// ensures that you are connecting to the\nofficial website and that any information you provide is encrypted\nand transmitted securely.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Christianity Comes to the Americas | Christian History ...\") First “Americans”\nWho: Peoples from NE Asia\nWhen: According to many scholars, they crossed the Bering Strait about 12,000 years ago (though scattered signs of human life predate that).\nWhere: By 9000 years ago, distinct groups were spread from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Examples of those before or at the time of Columbus: the Carib (Caribbean islands and Central America), the Nasca and Moche (Peru), the Araucanians (Chile), Guarani (Brazil and Paraguay), and the Toltecs (Mesoamerica).\nMaya\nWhere: Mesoamerica (Central Mexico to Nicaragua)\nWhen: Dominant for hundreds of years; golden era ended around A.D. 900.\nCulture: Agricultural experts; life centered on corn as both staff of life and god. Skilled in astronomy, the arts, warfare, and math (they used the concept of zero 1,000 years before Europe). Complex writing system.\nReligion: Highly important; rituals involved blood sacrifice.\nEncounter: Already weakened, could not significantly oppose Spanish.\nAztec\nWhere: Mesoamerica\nWhen: Zenith by the 1300s.\nCulture: Capital, Tenochtitlán (Mexico City), much larger than London in 1519. Violent and highly organized. The “Romans” of the New World.\nReligion: Highest offering to gods (corn god was central) was human heart. Motecuhzoma II’s (Montezuma II’s) crowning in 1502 required sacrifice of 5,000 people; dedication of great temple 20,000 people.\nEncounter: Spaniards’ smallpox and numerous wars with Cortés and native allies decimated them.\nInca\nWhere: Empire stretched 2,500 miles from Ecuador to Chile, larger than Roman Empire. 12 million people. Capital in Cuzco— “the center of the universe”—with secondary capital in Quito.\nWhen: 1400s and early 1500s.\nCulture: 18,000 miles of paved roads. City of Machu Picchu boasted 100 acres of temples, plazas, barracks, and houses. All land held by emperor in trust for people. Communication in quipu, complex bundles of colored and knotted string.\nReligion: Sun god above all.\nEncounter: Their gold and silver seduced Pizarro, who, aided by smallpox and civil wars, conquered the empire.\nChurch’s Impact\n•Spanish culture: Charles I, king of Spain, prohibited non-Spanish clergy from going to the Americas. So Latin America became marked by the unique qualities of Spanish Catholicism.\n•Depopulation: Spanish expansion into the Americas caused rapid depopulation. Some scholars estimate that when Columbus arrived, there were 44,000,000 native Americans. Just 150 years later, there were only 5,600,000. What caused the dramatic drop? European diseases (such as smallpox), wars and slaughters, and forced labor or slavery. Many Christians did, however, speak out against the atrocities and try to alleviate the natives’ sufferings.\n•Schools and hospitals: By 1820, there were 25 universities and 56 secondary schools, most started and run by monastic orders, as well as numerous hospitals.\n•Church and state: Church and state were united and controlled all facets of life. By 1805 Alexander von Humboldt estimated that in some provinces of Mexico the church directly or indirectly controlled 80 percent of the land.\n•Hierarchical society: Society was stratified with the Spanish-born Peninsulares at the top; their American-born children (Creoles) next, the “mixed-blood” mestizos next; the Indians and black slaves at the bottom. Church leadership drew mainly from the top tiers.\n•Church orientation: 500 years after the first Christian contact, the region is a strong Catholic center, with increasing numbers of Protestants.\nFirst Christian Missionaries\n•Who: Bernal Buyl, vicar apostolate and representative of Ferdinand and Isabella, and 12 other churchmen.\n•When: Columbus’s second voyage. Columbus was directed in May 1493 to convert the natives to Christianity and to establish a colony. The missionaries sailed with him that September, bringing equipment for a church (a gift from Queen Isabella).\n•Where: La Isabela, a settlement founded on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (located between Cuba and Puerto Rico).

And if we can get it right here, right in Tulsa, I believe we can get it right everywhere.\nDreisen Heath, Human Rights Watch\nMany cities, states and institutions across the US are attempting to come to terms with their racist past and present with local forms of reparations.\nRosewood, Florida; Evanston, Illinois and the state of California are just a few places that have taken steps to address the inequalities brought on by systemic, anti-Black discrimination. Human Rights Watch has long been supportive of reparations by the federal government to account for the brutality of slavery and subsequent racist laws and institutions. In February 2021, I testified in front of US Congress about HR 40, a bill that explores a pathway to federal reparations.\nDreisen Heath, testimony for the House Subcommittee\nIf racial justice is ever to be achieved, repair needs to be part of the equation.\nDreisen Heath, Human Rights Watch\nWith mounting pressure from the public to address systemic racism the House Judiciary Committee held a vote on HR 40 and approved it. This offers new hope that an opportunity for racial healing will finally happen in the US.\nGreg Robinson, Community Activist\nI don’t believe we can have a conversation about moving forward as a country if we don’t have a conversation rooted in the truth of what has not been repaired in terms of this country’s treatment and usage of African-American labor, of African-American minds and frankly, and mostly of African-American bodies.\nKristi Williams, Descendant of Massacre Survivor\nGive my people back land, give my people money that our ancestors built this country, built these corporations off their blood, sweat, tears, agony, pay them for that. Give us good policies to operate within this system.\nDamario Solomon- Simmons, Civil Rights Attorney\nAnd I believe that the Covid-19 break, coupled with what happened with George Floyd, opened up an opportunity that we can finally get to the root of all the disparities, the inequality and the discrimination which is anti-Black white supremacy\nReverend Robert Turner\nSo the very fact of reparations if they ever did it, would be given, will give a sense of hope and optimism that this country that I loved for so long, finally loves me back.\nHands up!

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> I need to know about how inventions changed people's lives. </think>\n<search> how did inventions change people's lives </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Describe an invention that changed people’s lives | IELTS ...\") IELTS Speaking Part 2\nDescribe an invention that changed people’s lives\nYou should say:\n• What it was\n• Who invented it\n• When it was invented\nAnd explain how it changed people’s lives\nSample Recording\nSample\nI would like to talk about the telephone which, in my opinion, is one of the most revolutionary creations that has changed our lives.\nAs far as I know, Alexander Graham Bell was the father of this terrific device and he invented it in the last century through a lot of trial and error.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that human life has completely changed since the first telephone was devised. A few centuries ago people could only communicate long distances through writing letters, which could take ages to be delivered. And in the case of emergencies or confidential information, writing letters really wasn’t an effective way of communicating.\nSo, one of the main reasons that I believe that the telephone has changed people’s lives is simply by making communication between people so much faster, easier and more convenient than ever before. These days when you need to get in contact with somebody, all you need to do is pick up your phone, dial a few numbers and wait for them to answer. And if they don’t answer, then you can usually just leave a voice message for them to let them know what it is you wanted to tell them.\nFurthermore, I believe that communication is at the core of social development, and I think that the advent of the telephone has made a great contribution to this area of life.\nSo, whether the information is urgent, confidential, or even down right unnecessary, I think that the telephone has made a massive difference to people’s lives and our societies as well.\nVocabulary highlights:\n1. revolutionary creation – something that made a big difference in people’s lives\n2. the father of – the inventor or creator of something\n3. trial and error – trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes\n4. exaggeration – to over-state something, to say it is better or worse than it really is\n5. devised – planned or invented\n6. take ages – take a long time\n7. confidential – secret\n8. to get in contact with somebody – to contact someone by mail, email, message or phone\n9. at the core of – at the centre of\n10. advent – the arrival or beginning of something\n11. a great contribution – a big help\n12. down right – absolutely or completely\nDoc 2(Title: \"What Causes Change in an Organization? 10 Factors Explored\") ires strength, vision, and a tremendous amount of hard work.\n6) Competitive innovation\nCompetitive innovation forces companies to change. When a competitive company innovate something or do something which can be dangerous for your product then to meet the competition you need to make changes in your strategies and produce a product which is either equivalent to the product of your competitors or has something new which can attract customers.\nCompetitive innovation has been seen in the present times in smartphones companies. Apple is considered a leader of smartphones company, and it has been known for introducing the most innovative products in the market.\nOther smartphone companies like Google, Samsung, OnePlus copies ideas from Apple with their personal touch to stay in the competition.\nIt seems that at present, all the companies have reached a saturation point of innovation which was apparent from the launch of Apple’ iPhone 11.\nEven though the latest iPhones of Apple are full of improved feature, but it has not introduced anything out of the box like it was known for in the times of Steve Jobs.\nCompetitive innovation is both good and bad for the companies as it keeps a company on its toes to stay ahead of competitors and at the same time, it causes stress in the employees and management to come up with innovative ideas frequently.\n7) Cost Cutting\nCost-cutting is also a factor that causes a change in an organization. Companies are forced to cut the cost of its products when a competitor company introduces a product with similar features but at lower prices.\nPrice is a factor which influences the buying decision of customers. Either you are too confident of your products like Apple, or you are required to cut cost according to your competitors in order to stay in the market.\n8) Merger and acquisition\nMerger and acquisition also a factor that causes a change in an organization. The merger means when two companies come together to work. When a merger happens, companies are required to change their structures to adapt to the work environment of one another.\nSimilarly, when a company acquires a new company, it is required to cut cost from some of its operations in order to invest in new products and services or for the development of the acquired company.\nThis is an internal change that an organization makes on its own and not forced by any external changes like we have discussed before in the article.\nThe organization might reduce staff to keep employees acquired with a new organization or changes the nature of jobs of some employees to manage both the companies effectively.\n9) Change in the business structure\nAnother internal factor which causes a change in an organization is the change in the business structure. Like I have mentioned at the beginning of the article is that change is inevitable.\nManagement is required to change in the business structure to adapt to new technologies or in order to enhance the productivity of the organization.\nThink of times when computers were introduced in the organization and organizations are required to change from bookkeeping to maintaining accounts in computers. Employees were provided with training and hiring was made to acquire employees to meet the requirements of new technologies.\nSimilarly, in the present times, too, the structure of the organization changed when they were needed to take their business online to meet the current demand of the customers.\n10) End-of-life of products\nMarket changes, and with that, the need for products also changes. There are some products which stay in demand up to a certain time, and slowly their need diminishes from the market.\nAt that point, the company is required to think of some innovative ideas to produce new products so that they can stay relevant in the market.\nFor example, a few years ago mobile companies were producing mobile phones with keypad, but when touch screen mobile phones were introduced in the market, the value of keypad phones re\nDoc 3(Title: \"3 Major Ways Data Science is Changing the World Today\") e as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart.

Stigma: Unemployment brings more than just ‘no work’. It also brings with it the disgrace that the person has to bear. Nobody likes to be termed as unemployed.\n11. Standard of living: In times of unemployment, the competition for jobs and the negotiation power of the individual decreases, and thus also the living standard of people with reduced salary packages and income.\n12. Employment gaps: To further complicate the situation, the longer the individual is out of a job, the more difficult it becomes to find one.\nEmployers find employment gaps a negative aspect. No one wants to hire a person who has been out of work for some time, even when there’s no fault of the individual per se.\n13. Loss of skills’ usage: The unemployed are not able to put their skills to use. And in a situation where it goes on for too long, the person may have to lose some of his/her skills.\nSocial and Psychological Impacts of Unemployment\nApart from the economic consequences, unemployment also has significant social and psychological impacts on individuals and society as a whole.\nHere are some additional effects worth considering:\n1. Social isolation:\nUnemployment can lead to social isolation as individuals may withdraw from social interactions due to feelings of shame, embarrassment, or the inability to participate in activities that require financial resources.\nThis isolation can have detrimental effects on mental health and overall well-being.\n2. Strained relationships:\nFinancial strain and the stress associated with unemployment can strain relationships with family, friends, and partners.\nThe inability to contribute financially and fulfill social roles may lead to conflicts and strained dynamics within households.\n3. Skill deterioration:\nLong-term unemployment can result in a loss of skills and knowledge.\nWithout opportunities to utilize and enhance their skills, individuals may experience a decline in their professional abilities, making it more challenging to re-enter the workforce and contributing to a cycle of prolonged unemployment.\n4. Loss of social identity:\nWork provides individuals with a sense of purpose, identity, and belonging within society.\nWhen unemployed, individuals may experience a loss of social identity, feeling disconnected from the productive and valued roles they once held. This loss can impact self-esteem and overall psychological well-being.\n5. Generational impacts:\nUnemployment can have intergenerational effects, particularly when young individuals struggle to enter the job market or experience long periods of unemployment early in their careers.\nThis can hinder their long-term prospects, limit earning potential, and perpetuate cycles of poverty and unemployment within families.\n6. Increased inequality:\nUnemployment exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities within society.\nCertain marginalized groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, often face higher rates of unemployment and greater challenges in finding employment opportunities.\n7. Strain on public resources:\nHigh levels of unemployment place a burden on public resources, including social welfare programs and healthcare systems.\nGovernments must allocate significant funds to support the unemployed, provide job training, and address the social consequences of unemployment, which can strain public finances.\n8. Lost human potential:\nUnemployment represents a loss of human potential for both individuals and society.\nWhen individuals are unable to contribute their skills, knowledge, and talents to the workforce, it hampers overall economic growth and development. Society misses out on the innovations and productivity that a fully employed population can generate.\nSummary\nAddressing the negative impacts of unemployment requires a comprehensive approach that includes not only economic policies to s\nDoc 5(Title: \"Reasons Why Laws Change - Year 12 Legal Studies\") anging values within the community for example the legalisation of abortion and the banning of smoking in pubs/clubs and in cars with minors.\nChanging community awareness:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community awareness. As a national community, we are much more informed today and aware of relevant issues largely due to the speed and efficiency of communication. As informed citizens, we put pressure on law makers to amend or introduce legislation in areas that we believe need to change. For example, Brodie's law was introduced in 2011 after a teenager ended her life due to bullying at a café where she worked. This law now makes it a serious crime (punishable by up to 10 years) to bully others in the workplace and holds spreads the responsibility of ending bullying.\nChanging Expectations of the Legal System:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to the change expectations towards our legal system. Years ago, laws were expected to regulate behaviour however people now expect the law to uphold individual rights as well as protect people from harm. As such, the law has needed to take a more active role to ensure that it remains relevant. Examples of these include online defamation, duty of care and negligence.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that inventions significantly changed people's lives.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> I need to know how an increase in the price level affects the real value of money. </think>\n<search> how an increase in the price level affects the real value of money </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Value of Money and the Price Level (With Diagram)\") The below mentioned article provides an overview on the value of money and the price level.\nSubject Matter:\nThe average level of all prices in a country is called the price level. There are thousands of waves in a sea, each wave having a different height.\nNevertheless, we can calculate the average level of the sea and call it the sea- level. Similarly, we can calculate the price level, although there are thousands of prices, all moving in different ways.\nWhen the price level rises money can buy less goods and services. So we say that its purchasing power has fallen. Conversely, when the price level falls, money can buy more and we can say its purchasing power has gone up. Thus, the value of money changes inversely with the price level. In our country, the price level increased by about 400% during World War n (1939-1945). The value of the rupee fell by the same percentage.\nWhy Does the Price Level Change?\nChanges in the price level are caused by two factors:\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n(a) changes in the supply of money, and\n(b) changes in the supply of goods and services.\nWhen the quantity of money in circulation in a country is increased (e.g., by printing new notes) more money is available to the people for making purchases, the demand for goods and services goes up and the price level tends to rise.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nConversely, if the supply of money decreases people can buy less and the price level tends to go down. Again, if there is an increase in the supply of goods and services, the price level tends to fall and, in the converse case, it tends to rise.\nThus, if the supply of money increases by 25% and the supply of goods and services also increases by the same 25%, there will ordinarily be no effect on the price level. There are other factors which influence the price level (e.g., the number of times money changes hands or the velocity of circulation) but the first two factors are the most important of all.\nIn India, during World War II, there was a large increase in the volume of notes printed by the Government. There was, at the same time, a decrease in the supply of goods (due to reduction of imports, etc.). Consequently, the price level increased many times.\nIt is possible to analyse the causes of price changes in a different way. Modern writers believe that price level changes are brought about by changes in the level of income, i.e., the average amount of money earned by that people when more income is earned, the demand for the goods and services goes up and price rise. When income falls, less goods and services are demanded and price fall. [Changes in the level of income depend on two factors, the volume of savings and the volume of investment in the country.]\nThe Inflation Machine:\nWhen inflation is reduced to its simplest elements, its proximate causes can easily be identified. Figure 19.1 represents the inflation machine. Let us assume for a moment that the value of the consumable goods and services produced is in balance with the money paid to all those who compete for the purchase of the goods and services.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nThen prices will remain unchanged. Of course, prices of individual items will fluctuate due to changes in demand and supply conditions, but the aggregate price level will be stable. In fact, the inflation machine is nothing more than or less than a broad view of supply and demand and the market clearing price.\nNow, if we load the left hand side of the inflation machine with more money than the value of goods and services on the right side, prices will surely increase. Competition for the limited amount of goods that is available will rare prices. Another way to load the left hand side of the inflation machine is for the same number of rupees to be spent with greater frequency. This is called increasing the velocity of money.\nThe rupees flow through the economic system faster and this creates a similar effect. Alternatively, if people take money out of savings and spend it, that increases the number\nDoc 2(Title: \"Value of Money and the Price Level (With Diagram)\") hine is for the same number of rupees to be spent with greater frequency. This is called increasing the velocity of money.\nThe rupees flow through the economic system faster and this creates a similar effect. Alternatively, if people take money out of savings and spend it, that increases the number of rupees in competition for the available goods. The effect is the same—competition for what is available on the right side will drive prices up.\nDoc 3(Title: \"1. Explain how an increase in the price level affects the ...\") Related Questions\nSpeeches made by Federal Reserve officials are an integral part of the Fed’s management of expectations strategy.

After the 2020 Covid pandemic, with accompanying supply chain shortages, inflation surged to a millennium high of 8.0% in 2022. Despite reduced inflation of 4.1% in 2023 and the first half of 2024 clocking a 3.25% inflation rate, consumers are reeling from higher prices and reduced purchasing power.\nNow is the time to learn how to prepare for inflation and how you can counteract the impact of inflation.\nFind out what causes inflation to rise and how to fight inflation.\nContents\nToggleThis article may contain affiliate links which means that – at zero cost to you – I might earn a commission if you sign up or buy through the affiliate link.\nThe most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the CPI.

The more money the government prints, the less your dollar is worth.\nThe main causes of inflation are:\n- The economy is growing too quickly and there is greater demand for goods and services, than there is supply.\n- Supply is reduced and there is greater demand for fewer goods, thus driving up prices.\n- The government increases the money supply, so the dollar is worth less, due to a greater supply of money in the economy.\n- Higher wages, which increase firms costs and consumers disposable income, thereby boosting demand and driving up prices.\nSimply put, inflation causes each dollar to be less valuable than before and purchase fewer goods and services than in the past.\nDuring the recent Corona Virus pandemic, global trade was interrupted, and production for many goods and their inputs was stalled. Production slowed across the globe, as did international transportation. This caused bottlenecks in supplies and shortages of important materials and products. As supply chains withered, demand remained steady causing prices, and subsequently inflation to increase.\nDespite tempered inflation pf 4.1% in 2023, this increase on top of 2022’s 5.0% surge is causing hardship for consumers, and businesses. Goods and services are more expensive, and the dollar buys less than it had in the recent past.\nAccording to Lawrence H. White at econlib.org, inflation rates since 1950, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), ranged from -0.7% in 1954 to a high of 13.3% in 1979. Although since 1991, the inflation rate has remained relatively constant, between 1.6% and 3.3% per year, until 2021.\nUsing the latest US government CPI data from usinflationcalculator.com, an item that cost $100 in 1980 would cost $381.28 in mid-2024 for a 281.3% increase.\nYou need to learn how to prepare for inflation at home, and while shopping and traveling.\nThe first two decades of the 2000’s spoiled us, but now we are back to a higher inflation period.

    "agent_answer": "Sensory impairment affects children in multiple ways, primarily impacting their communication and social interaction skills. For instance, hearing impairment can lead to delayed speech development and difficulty in understanding verbal instructions, causing the child to feel isolated and withdrawn unless steps are taken to address these issues. Visual impairment similarly restricts a child's ability to learn through observation, making it harder for them to develop interpersonal skills and social connections. These impairments necessitate close collaboration with parents and specialists to ensure the child receives appropriate support and accommodations tailored to their needs.\n\n<answer> communication and social interaction skills </answer>\n\nBased on the information provided, sensory impairment primarily affects children's communication and social interaction skills.

The first happens when there is a fault in the inner ear – usually in the cochlea. This is called ‘sensorineural deafness’ and is permanent.\nThe level of hearing loss may be described as mild, moderate, severe or profound and may not be the same in each ear, with only a few children totally deaf.\nAmplification of residual hearing may be made possible with a hearing aid. The more profound the hearing loss, the greater the likelihood that the child will be given a cochlear implant, which allows electrical signals to be sent directly to the auditory nerve, providing a sensation of hearing.\nThe second type happens when sounds fail to pass efficiently through the outer and middle ear to the cochlea and auditory nerve. This is most commonly caused by a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, often referred to as ‘glue’ ear.\nThis is known as ‘conductive deafness’ and is the most common type of hearing loss. A conductive loss is likely to fluctuate and be temporary.\nIt is often treated by inserting grommets into the eardrum: ventilation tubes which allow fresh air to enter the middle ear to keep it free of fluid.\nMost children with a significant sensorineural hearing loss will have been identified before they enter your Early Years setting.\nOther children, particularly those with a fluctuating conductive loss, may not.\nAs an Early Years practitioner you have an important role to play in noticing and recording aspects of a child’s development that might indicate a hearing loss.\nLook out for the following signs in children:\n● Delayed development of speech\n● Watching your face and lips carefully when you’re speaking\n● Often failing to respond when called by name\n● Pausing after an instruction has been given, then watching other children to see what to do\n● Speaking unusually loudly or quietly\nA significant hearing loss can have a major impact on other aspects of a child’s development – particularly on communication and social interaction skills.\nThe child may use sign language, speech or a combination of the two. Unless steps are taken to help the child feel confident in social situations, they are likely to be withdrawn – remaining on the edge of groups of children or preferring a one-to-one activity with an adult.\nHow can I help?\nFirstly, it’s vital to work closely with the child’s parents. They will have an enormous amount of information about the nature of their child’s hearing loss and about the best means of communication.\nSecondly, a child with a significant hearing loss is likely to be having regular input from a specialist teacher or support assistant. It’s important to make time to seek their advice.\nYou can help a young child with a hearing impairment by:\n● Providing additional visual clues to support information you give verbally\n● Making sure that the child can see your face and lips when you’re speaking, and that you gain their attention before speaking\n● Checking that the child has understood you, repeating or giving extra clues if necessary\n● Considering learning sign language\n● Monitoring noise levels – a hearing aid amplifies everything, not just your voice\nSince 2006, all babies in the UK have been offered a hearing screen within a few days of birth. Initial concerns were raised about Beth’s hearing as a result of this screening.\nFurther assessment, when she was still only a few weeks old confirmed a profound, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss.\nAt first, a specialist health visitor visited Beth and her family regularly at home to monitor her progress and give advice.\nAfter her second birthday this input became the responsibility of a specialist teacher of the deaf, with additional input\nDoc 2(Title: \"SEN: Understanding sensory impairment | A Unique Child ...\") ild longer to explore new toys and activities\n● Considering providing a secure, familiar place to play\n● If a toy rolls out of reach, leading the child towards it to encourage independent exploration\n● Describing the things you or others do, to the child\n● Helping the child connect with others and to link present with past experiences\n● Encouraging other children to approach the child\n● Taking care not to overprotect the child, becoming a barrier between them and others\nDrew was born without eyes, and initial input to his family was provided by a specialist health visitor.\nFrom six months he attended a specialist parent and toddler group run by the QTVI and an SSA. He had weekly home visits from a Portage Home Visitor doing activities recommended by the QTVI.\nAs Drew approached his third birthday a place was sought in a nursery attached to a local primary school.\nPrior to Drew starting nursery his key worker was given time to spend with him at home. In this way she became familiar with his needs and he became familiar with her.\nWith advice from the QTVI, the nursery staff thought carefully about layout and routines before gradually introducing Drew into sessions. Mum stayed with him initially until he got his bearings.\nHis confidence grew and grew, and he became quite a ‘character’. 18 months later, following a thoroughly planned transition, Drew moved into the Reception class at the same school.\nBy this time he had a Statement of Special Educational Needs and daily input from an SSA.\nFor further information, contact: Royal National Institute of Blind People\nJulia Dunlop is a former senior educational psychologist and early ears specialist. As a teacher, she also had several years’ experience working with preschool children with disabilities in a Child Development Centre multi-disciplinary team.\nBody awareness – What it is & helping kids develop it\nEditors picks\nDoc 3(Title: \"SEN: Understanding sensory impairment | A Unique Child ...\") d a profound, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss.\nAt first, a specialist health visitor visited Beth and her family regularly at home to monitor her progress and give advice.\nAfter her second birthday this input became the responsibility of a specialist teacher of the deaf, with additional input from a special support assistant (SSA).\nBeth and her family developed skills in British Sign Language (BSL). Beth entered nursery at the age of three.\nThe SSA continued to support her and advice continued from the teacher – both in nursery and at home.\nHer key worker went on a BSL course and began to sign – not just with Beth but with all the children.\nSoon after Beth’s third birthday a cochlear implant was inserted. Nursery staff collaborated closely with the cochlear implant team from the hospital in monitoring any changes in Beth’s response to sound.\nIt soon became clear that the implant had made a difference and that Beth was increasingly able to recognise, react to and imitate some sounds.\nAt the age of four Beth transferred to a specialist unit within a mainstream primary school. Her signing skills had become more sophisticated and she had begun to develop a small vocabulary of spoken words.\nFor further information, contact: National Deaf Children’s Society\nThe term ‘visually impaired’ is used to describe a child who has sight problems severe enough to interfere with their learning.\nThe majority of children with a visual impairment still have some vision – only five per cent are totally blind.\nMost blind or partially sighted children have their sight problem from birth, though a small number lose their sight later in life following illness or an accident.\nMost children with a marked visual impairment will arrive in your ursery with their condition already diagnosed.\nYour observations can still contribute to the ongoing assessment of the child’s functional use of vision, linking with the Qualified Teacher of Visually Impaired children (QTVI).\nLook out for signs of impaired vision in children by noticing children who:\n● Display undue sensitivity to light\n● Close or cover one eye when attempting visual tasks\n● Often trip or bump into things\n● Holds books unusually close to their face\n● Tilt their head to an unusual angle when trying to focus\nSince 80 per cent of communication is non-verbal, young children with impaired vision are at a huge disadvantage when developing interpersonal skills.\nUnable to discern the facial expressions of others, they cannot ‘read’ reactions to things they say and find verbal turn-taking very difficult.\nThese children cannot learn by watching, only by doing.\nRestricted vision also leads to restricted mobility. In a typically developing child, vision is a huge motivator: seeing a desired toy just out of reach prompts the child to stretch for it or crawl towards it, but visually impaired children don’t know the toy exists.\nThe development of play – leading to concepts such as conservation, classification and one-to-one correspondence – is also negatively affected by visual impairment.\nWhen a child cannot observe others at play, it limits their own skills.\nFinally, independence and self-help skills are significantly delayed in a child with sight problems.\nClose links with parents and specialist professionals is vital. Additionally, you can help a young child with a visual impairment by:\n● Making wall displays colourful, clear and uncluttered\n● Offering toys with good colour contrast and books with simple illustrations\n● Offering activities that draw upon all the senses\n● Saying the child’s name before giving instructions\n● Giving individual demonstrations of tasks\n● Warning of changes in routine\n● Giving the child longer to explore new toys and activities\n● Considering providing a secure, familiar place to play\n● If a toy rolls out of reach, leading the child towards it to encourage independent exploration\n● Describing the things you or others do, to the child\n● Helping the child connect with others and t\nDoc 4(Title: \"Introduction - Development During Middle Childhood - NCBI ...\") show some level of participation in organized activities. The impact of participation in out-of-school activities has been studied very little. Because of the increased number of children involved and the opportunities available, however, these activities should be considered a significant dimension in the expanding social worlds of children ages · 6-12.\nThemes of the Report\nIn the chapters that follow, the status of knowledge on children in middle childhood is assessed within the framework of the three major foci that guided the panel's work:\n- 1.\nthe distinctive characteristics of children ages 6-12 compared with children in other developmental periods and the typical changes that occur during these years;\n- 2.\nthe impact of access to new settings and changing qualities of relationships, including the tasks, options, and limitations that are characteristic of the environments that school-age children encounter; and\n- 3.\nthe nature and long-term implications of developmental difficulties and the different developmental trajectories followed by individual children during middle childhood.\nThe distinctiveness of middle childhood development depends, in the first analysis, on the characteristics of children as they enter and traverse the period. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 focus on the child's physical and cognitive growth and the fundamental psychological processes of developing a sense of self and capabilities for self-regulation during middle childhood.\nIn Chapter 2, Jack P. Shonkoff addresses the nature of physical changes leading to puberty—a physical event that now occurs by age 12 for large numbers of American children. He devotes attention to research on neurotransmission processes and hormonal factors in behavior and their contribution to knowledge of the biological substrate of middle childhood development. Studies in these areas offer promising approaches to the understanding of gender differences as well as to a range of specific behavior patterns. Research on brain-behavior relations can facilitate better understanding of both basic intellectual and behavioral functioning and the various dysfunctions that are commonly grouped together as learning disabilities. Difficulties with school performance are a major social and psychological problem in the elementary school years, and the long-term problems associated with them are now well established.\nThe intellectual capabilities of children ages 6-12 have been extensively studied, and these studies are a major source of knowledge about the distinctiveness of middle childhood and its links to other developmental periods. In Chapter 3, Kurt W. Fischer and Daniel Bullock distill the major information that has emerged from this research. The impetus for much of this work has come from the Piagetian tradition, in which the more elaborate conceptual and reasoning skills of school-age children were attributed to a capacity for concrete operational thought. Fischer and Bullock also identify a major shift in cognitive functioning for Western children between ages 5 and 7 and another between ages 10 and 12. A primary theme in their review is the way in which children's environments and typical experiences \"collaborate\" in the process of cognitive change. They urge an approach to cognitive change and cognitive performance that focuses on the environmental supports for certain skills and approaches to tasks and problems that children develop. They also explore the linkages between these changes and other developmental changes, such as emotional knowledge and expression.\nHazel J. Markus and Paula S. Nurius (Chapter 4) extend the analysis of cognitive components to the school-age child's task of forming a self-concept from the diverse new sources of information about his or her characteristics and capabilities. Much new information derived from a wide range of settings must be incorporated into knowledge about the self in these years. This knowledge, together with knowledge about social norm\nDoc 5(Title: \"Chapter 17: Cognitive Development in Middle Childhood ...\") erational children thinking that a tall beaker filled with 8 ounces of water was “more” than a short, wide bowl filled with 8 ounces of water? Concrete operational children can understand the concept of conservation which means that changing one quality (in this example, height or water level) can be compensated for by changes in another quality (width). Consequently, there is the same amount of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.\nDecentration: Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any object (such as the height of the glass) and instead consider the changes in other dimensions too (such as the width of the glass). This allows for conservation to occur.\nSeriation: Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a methodical way is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can methodically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length, while younger children approach a similar task in a haphazard way.\nThese new cognitive skills increase the child’s understanding of the physical world, however according to Piaget, they still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think in systematic scientific ways. For example, when asked which variables influence the period that a pendulum takes to complete its arc and given weights they can attach to strings in order to do experiments, most children younger than 12 perform biased experiments from which no conclusions can be drawn (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).\nInformation Processing\nChildren differ in their memory abilities, and these differences predict both their readiness for school and academic performance in school (PreBler, Krajewski, & Hasselhorn, 2013). During middle and late childhood children make strides in several areas of cognitive function including the capacity of working memory, their ability to pay attention, and their use of memory strategies. Both changes in the brain and experience foster these abilities.\nWorking Memory: The capacity of working memory expands during middle and late childhood, and research has suggested that both an increase in processing speed and the ability to inhibit irrelevant information from entering memory are contributing to the greater efficiency of working memory during this age (de Ribaupierre, 2002). Changes in myelination and synaptic pruning in the cortex are likely behind the increase in processing speed and ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli (Kail, McBride-Chang, Ferrer, Cho, & Shu, 2013).\nChildren with learning disabilities in math and reading often have difficulties with working memory (Alloway, 2009). They may struggle with following the directions of an assignment. When a task calls for multiple steps, children with poor working memory may miss steps because they may lose track of where they are in the task. Adults working with such children may need to communicate: Using more familiar vocabulary, using shorter sentences, repeating task instructions more frequently, and breaking more complex tasks into smaller more manageable steps. Some studies have also shown that more intensive training of working memory strategies, such as chunking, aid in improving the capacity of working memory in children with poor working memory (Alloway, Bibile, & Lau, 2013).\nAttention: As noted above, the ability to inhibit irrelevant information improves during this age group, with there being a sharp improvement in selective attention from age six into adolescence (Vakil, Blachstein, Sheinman, & Greenstein, 2009). Children also improve in their ability to shift their attention between tasks or different features of a task (Carlson, Zelazo, & Faja, 2013). A younger child who is asked to sort objects into piles based on type of object, car versus animal, or color of object, red versus blue, may have difficulty if you switch from asking them to sort based on type to now having\n</information>\n\n\nSensory impairment affects children in multiple ways, primarily impacting their communication and social interaction skills.
