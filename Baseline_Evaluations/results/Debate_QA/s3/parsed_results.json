    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo address this question, we need to consider several factors:\n1. The prevalence of mental illness among criminals.\n2. Whether mental illness is a cause or just an associated factor in criminal behavior.\n3. The types of mental illnesses that might be linked to criminal behavior.\n4. The effectiveness of treatment in reducing such behavior.\n\nI don't have specific data on hand, so I'll need to search for more detailed information.\n</think>\n<search>extent mental illness contributes to criminal behavior</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: iatric illness and criminality. This narrative, coupled with a lack of adequate mental health resources, has positioned persons with mental illness in a precarious situation, often at the intersection of health and justice, with the scales tilted unjustly against them.[7]) Clinical Significance\nResearch suggests that untreated mental illness, especially when combined with active symptoms such as delusions or long-standing paranoia, may increase the potential for violent behavior. Cases in point include individuals experiencing command hallucinations, which may drive them to act in ways they would typically not. However, it's vital to differentiate between actions driven by psychiatric distress and those stemming from criminal intent.[8]\nAnother notable concern is the presence of comorbidities. Substance use disorder, for instance, stands out as a prominent risk factor. A comorbid substance use disorder can amplify the risk of engaging in violent or criminal behavior among individuals with major psychiatric conditions. Some studies even posit that the rise in violent crimes associated with mental illness might be predominantly attributed to a history of alcohol or drug use.[9] In patients with a major psychiatric illness with comorbid substance use disorder, there is a four-fold increase in the risk of committing a crime or violence.[10]\nBeyond the direct influence of psychiatric symptoms and substance use, other external factors also play a role. Socioeconomic factors such as unemployment and homelessness, combined with secondary effects of mental illness like cognitive impairments, can further compound the risk. For instance, individuals with untreated severe mental illness might find themselves in dire situations, leading them to commit crimes out of desperation or as a response to their environment.\nIt is also paramount to address the systemic challenges surrounding mental health care. Many individuals with mental illnesses grapple with accessing timely and appropriate treatment. Funding cuts and budgetary constraints in public health sectors have further strained the already limited resources, leading to an unfortunate scenario where individuals might be more likely to engage in criminal activity due to lack of adequate support. In fact, current mental health facility capacities in the U.S. are reminiscent of the severely lacking infrastructure from the 1850s. To address these concerns, we must understand the intricate balance between mental health and potential criminal behavior, ensuring that individuals receive the care they need while dispelling unfounded fears and misconceptions.\nOther Issues\nA far-sighted national mental health policy with expanded availability and access to treatment, while costly in the short run, could be a cost-effective and sensible approach. By some estimates, a ninety-day treatment in a mental hospital might prevent the 10-year imprisonment of an individual with mental illness. Expanded availability and access to mental health treatment would provide significant savings to society and crime victims. More importantly, it would improve a person with mental illness' quality of life and transform these individuals into productive members of society.\nThe link between psychiatric illness and criminality is complex and has profound societal implications. There is a great need for in-depth research and imaginative solutions for access and availability to mental health treatment. Currently, there is scant evidence to suggest that mental illness can independently predict criminal behavior. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that shows that persons with mental illness are far more likely to be the victim of violent crime rather than the perpetrator.\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nTo break the links between mental illness and criminality requires an inter-professional team of psychiatrists, social workers, and patient advocates to detect and reduce or eliminate risk factors that lead persons with\nDoc 2(Title: Abstract) Background\nThe role of mental illness in violent crime is elusive, and there are harmful stereotypes that mentally ill people are frequently violent criminals. Studies find greater psychopathology among violent offenders, especially convicted homicide offenders, and higher rates of violence perpetration and victimization among those with mental illness. Emotion dysregulation may be one way in which mental illness contributes to violent and/or criminal behavior. Although there are many stereotyped portrayals of individuals with dissociative disorders (DDs) being violent, the link between DDs and crime is rarely researched.\nMethods\nWe reviewed the extant literature on DDs and violence and found it is limited to case study reviews. The present study addresses this gap through assessing 6-month criminal justice involvement among 173 individuals with DDs currently in treatment. We investigated whether their criminal behavior is predicted by patient self-reported dissociative, posttraumatic stress disorder and emotion dysregulation symptoms, as well as clinician-reprted depressive disorders and substance use disorder.\nResults\nPast 6 month criminal justice involvement was notably low: 13% of the patients reported general police contact and 5% reported involvement in a court case, although either of these could have involved the DD individual as a witness, victim or criminal. Only 3.6% were recent criminal witnesses, 3% reported having been charged with an offense, 1.8% were fined, and 0.6% were incarcerated in the past 6 months. No convictions or probations in the prior 6 months were reported. None of the symptoms reliably predicted recent criminal behavior.\nConclusions\nIn a representative sample of individuals with DDs, recent criminal justice involvement was low, and symptomatology did not predict criminality. We discuss the implications of these findings and future directions for research.\nKeywords: Crime, Criminal behavior, Dissociation, Dissociative disorders, Trauma, Emotion dysregulation, PTSD, Violent crime\nBackground\nStereotypes abound in the media regarding violent behavior and crimes among those with mental illness. One need not look further than popular crime television shows, the latest blockbuster film or news stories on perpetrators of atrocities such as school shootings or terrorist attacks. Researchers have worked to unpack the complex question of what role mental illness plays in violence, if any, especially in light of mass shootings in the United States at Sandy Hook Elementary, Virginia Tech University and Pulse Nightclub, among others. Researchers generally agree that there is some relationship between mental illness and the risk for violence, such that mental illness increases the risk for violence perpetration as well as victimization, but there is less consensus on the specific psychopathology and symptoms that contribute to violence.\nA brief literature review on mental illness and violent behavior\nStereotypes about mental illness and violence are common among the general public. Link, Phelan, Bresnahan, Stueve and Pescosolido [1] presented a large sample (N = 1444) with vignettes of people with mental illness, in which no violent behavior or thoughts were described, and inquired how likely it was that the “patient” would be violent. Many participants believed it likely that the hypothetical mentally ill individual would perpetrate violence: 17% of respondents endorsed violence as likely among those with minor interpersonal problems, and 33% and 61% thought violence was likely among people with major depression or schizophrenia, respectively. Individuals with mental illness are frequently aware of others’ negative perceptions of them, which can worsen isolation, negative affect and treatment adherence [2, 3].\nIndividuals with psychological disorders that are highly stigmatized and misunderstood, such as schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder (BPD) and dissociative identity disorder (DID), oft\nDoc 3(Title: of violent crime rather than the perpetrator.) Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nTo break the links between mental illness and criminality requires an inter-professional team of psychiatrists, social workers, and patient advocates to detect and reduce or eliminate risk factors that lead persons with mental illness to commit a crime. This team approach includes a multi-tiered system that would identify at-risk patients early on and provide resources to prevent situations that bring the persons with mental illness in contact with the criminal justice system such as medical non-compliance and lack of food and shelter. For those individuals already inside the criminal justice system, there needs to be a targeted approach that includes rehabilitation, education, and empowerment. Finally, a concerted effort is required to educate the public at large and those in the criminal justice system, in particular, to dispel misperceptions and prevent mischaracterization, mislabeling of criminals as persons with mental illness and vice versa.\nReferences\n- 1.\n- Watson A, Hanrahan P, Luchins D, Lurigio A.

Lastly, potential psychological comordities to DDs related to violent behavior within the literature, such as mood and substance use disorders, should be examined as potential explanatorty variables for recent criminal justice involvement.) The present study\nMany questions remain regarding what role mental illness plays in violence. Are mentally ill individuals more likely to perpetrate violence compared to people who do not have mental illness? What psychiatric diagnoses are most highly associated with violent behavior and crime? Are individuals with DDs particularly likely to engage in violent and/or criminal behavior? The present study attempts to provide evidence on violent behavior and crime among individuals with DDs engaged in outpatient treatment.\nThe purpose of our study was threefold; first, to provide a review of the extant literature on DDs and violent behavior; second, to describe the prevalence of recent criminal justice involvement among a sample of treatment-engaged individuals with DDs; and third, to assess symptomatic predictors of violent behavior and crime among individuals with DDs, including dissociative, emotion dysregulation, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms, as well as problematic substance use. We hypothesized that crime rates would be low in our sample of individuals with DDs, with the majority of patients reporting no recent criminal history or involvement with the criminal justice system, unless their involvement was as victims of crime. Additionally, we hypothesized that the aforementioned symptoms (dissociation, emotion dysregulation, PTSD, depression and substance use) would not be significantly associated with recent criminal behavior and justice system involvement.\nMethods\nProcedure\nOverview and recruitment\nClinician and patient participants were recruited through the Treatment of Patients with Dissociative Disorders (TOP DD) Network study. The TOP DD Network study is a longitudinal educational intervention study of patients with DDs who are diagnosed with either DID or DDNOS/OSDD. Over the course of 1 year, patients and clinicians watched weekly 7–15 min psychoeducational and skills training videos and completed written reflection and behavioral exercises. Additionally, therapist and patient participants completed surveys every 6 months (at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months) that provided additional clinical and behavioral data.\nClinicians were recruited through listservs for mental health professionals, professional trauma conferences and emails to participated in the first TOP DD study [42, 43]. Clinicians were asked to enroll as a dyad with one DD patient from their caseload. All clinician and patient participants completed a voluntary consent process, and the study was approved by the Towson University Institutional Review Board. Eligibility requirements for patients in the TOP DD Network study included a DD diagnosis (DID, DDNOS or OSDD); being in treatment with their current clinician for at least 3 months prior to starting the study; reading English at an 8th grade level; being willing to continue in individual therapy and complete approximately 2 ½ hours weekly of study activities; and being able to tolerate references to trauma, dissociation and safety struggles.\nParticipants\nThe total TOP DD Network study included 242 patients who completed baseline measures, presented after the screening measures which verified study eligibility. TOP DD Network study patient participants were majority female (88.6%), Caucasian (82.1%), middle-aged (Median = 41), highly-educated (50.9% had at least a college diploma), and primarily resided in the United States (42.3%), although the study recruited internationally with a sizeable portion derived from Norway (27.5%) as well as other countries (30.2%). About half of participants (55.2%) were either in a dating or married relation\nDoc 5(Title: How better access to mental health care can reduce crime) Key Takeaways\n- American prisons house a disproportionate number of mentally ill inmates, making them some of the country's largest providers of mental health care.\n- Within two years of losing access to health care, those with a history of mental illness are more likely to be incarcerated.\n- Extending Medicaid eligibility is a cost-effective way to reduce crime and criminal justice expenditures.\nFor the past 50 years, the United States has relied on incarceration — rather than addressing many of the root causes underlying criminal activity — and this policy choice is taking a toll on society.\nA growing body of research shows that having a criminal record makes it harder to find a job and increases the likelihood of relying on public assistance (see e.g., Dobbie et al. 2018, Mueller-Smith 2015). Those factors — coupled with the high cost of keeping people behind bars — have called into question the cost-effectiveness of today’s criminal justice system.\nMy research offers policymakers a consideration for reducing criminal justice costs while also better serving already vulnerable groups of Americans: increasing access to mental health services.\nMeasuring the effectiveness of mental health care access has proved difficult because of the lack of data shared and linked between health and law enforcement agencies in the United States. But using administrative data from South Carolina that has been linked across various government agencies, I am able to show that men with a history of mental illness are more likely to be incarcerated after losing access to health care (Jácome 2020).\nPrevalence of mental illness in the criminal justice population\nStarting in the 1970s, policymakers at all levels of government adopted harsher criminal sanctions — such as longer sentence lengths and a higher likelihood of sending convicted offenders to prison — that contributed to rapid growth in the incarceration population (Neal and Rick 2016, Raphael and Stoll 2013). Today, more than 2 million individuals are incarcerated in local jails or in state or federal prisons (Maruschak and Minton 2020).\nIndividuals with mental illness are significantly over-represented in those facilities. More than one-third of inmates are diagnosed with a mental disorder prior to incarceration (Bronson and Berzofsky 2017). And on any given day, more than 1 million people with mental illness are locked up or on probation or parole (Frank and McGuire 2010).\nIn particular, low-income men with mental health histories are significantly more likely to be incarcerated than low-income men without mental health histories. Figure 1 shows the cumulative likelihood of incarceration at a given age for low-income men in South Carolina, separately for those with and without mental health histories. Low-income men with prior mental health histories (depicted in blue) were almost three times more likely to have been incarcerated by age 24 than those that had never received a diagnosis (depicted in red). Put differently, among low-income men who served a prison sentence before they were 21, 80 percent of them were diagnosed with a mental health disorder during adolescence.\nFigure 1. Share of Low-Income Men Ever Incarcerated, by Mental Health Diagnosis\nThose with mental health histories tend to have higher recidivism rates, serve longer sentences, and have more expensive medical needs than those without mental illness (Osher et al. 2012). The criminal justice system therefore spends a significant share of its resources housing and treating people with mental illness. A fifth of state prison expenditures are spent on correctional health care, and a third of this medical care goes to mental health care, pharmaceuticals, and substance-abuse treatment (Pew Charitable Trusts 2014). Correctional facilities have become some of the largest providers of mental health care in the country (Steinberg et al. 2015).\nCriminal justice expenditures ar\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information gathered, mental illness does contribute to criminal behavior, but this contribution is complex and multifaceted.

    "question": "When will Mexico start paying the United States for the new wall?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, it seems that Mexico has agreed to contribute $1.5 billion over two years for smart border technology. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mexico will start paying immediately or that this amount alone will effectively secure the border. The conversation indicates that the actual implementation and effectiveness of this funding are uncertain, and that the focus should be on prevention rather than just securing the border. The exact timeline for when Mexico will start paying is not explicitly stated, but it seems to be part of a broader agreement that includes changes in immigration policies and increased cooperation. Without a specific timeline, it's difficult to pinpoint when the payments will begin, but it is part of the agreement reached during the meeting between Biden and López Obrador. </think>\n\n<answer> Mexico has agreed to contribute $1.5 billion over two years for smart border technology, but the exact timeline for when payments will start is not specified.

But how will this money be spent and is it enough? What will the U.S. have to do in return? Given that we are on track for a record-breaking year in terms of illegal border crossings, what is at stake in terms of safety and security and what we must do to finally fix the border? Lora Ries is the director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at The Heritage Foundation, and on this episode, she explains.) Tim Doescher: Now we've got an incredible lineup of podcasts here at The Heritage Foundation. So much good content. But one podcast in particular that we wanted to highlight is The Kevin Roberts Show. Kevin is the new president here at The Heritage Foundation, and each week his compelling interviews give a rallying cry for lovers of freedom everywhere and gives us the playbook for how we can go on offense with our ideas. You can subscribe to the Kevin Roberts Show anywhere you listen to podcasts. So do it today. From The Heritage Foundation, I'm Tim Doescher and this is Heritage Explains.\nDonald Trump: And Mexico's going to pay for the wall, because Mexico ... I love the Mexican people. I respect the Mexican leaders, but the leaders are much sharper, smarter, and more cunning than our leaders. And just to finish people say, \"Oh, how are you going to get Mexico to pay?\" A politician, other than the people on this stage, I don't want to insult. A politician cannot get them to pay. I can.\nDoescher: That was candidate Donald Trump at a presidential debate in Colorado in October of 2015. Seems like an eternity ago. Now Trump spoke about the border a lot. And despite the narrative spun by the media, a lot actually happened under his administration. 458 miles of border wall was constructed, all sorts of ground sensing technology, drones, and other tech was implemented.\nDoescher: In addition, enforcing laws already on the books, like the Remain in Mexico Policy worked to keep border encounters down. While we never got a check from Mexico per se, increased cooperation with them, helped bring border crossings down. Then Biden took office. But before we get there, I wanted to cover one thing. A common measurement for illegal aliens crossing the border is the encounter count. Now an encounter is typically measured by two criteria.\nDoescher: First, apprehensions in which migrants are taken into custody in the United States to await adjudication. And two, expulsions in which migrants are immediately expelled to their home country or last country of transit without being held in us custody. So let's put it in context.\nDoescher: There were around 350,000 encounters at the Southern border in 2020, the last year of Trump's presidency. And in 2021, the first year of Biden's presidency around 1.1 million encounters. That's an over 210% increase. So what was the Biden administration's response, other than canceling the wall and killing the effective Remain in Mexico Policy?\nKamala Harris: Folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous track to the United States, Mexico border, do not come. Do not come.\nDoescher: Since Vice President Harris said that, we're on track to shatter encounter number records at the border for 2022. They're coming and they're not stopping. So what is the Biden Administration doing now? Here's CBS in Los Angeles.\nClip: President Biden and Mexican President Andreas Manuel Lopez [inaudible 00:04:14] at the White House announcing major agreements, including $1.5 billion in smart border technology paid for by Mexico.

Joe Biden: As I told you from the beginning and I mean this, I see, we see Mexico as an equal partner.\nClip: The two leaders met for several hours. President Biden announced the U.S. would expand the number of working visas, expand worker protections and said the U.S. would allow more refugees.\nDoescher: So let's recap. The number of encounters at the Southern border is through the roof and only getting worse. Mexico is now committing $1.5 billion over two years for smart border technology. And in return, the U.S. is going to increase the numbers of worker and refugee visas and provide more worker protection for them. So is this going to solve the crisis at the seemingly wide open border or is this just a political stunt, to be able to say Biden was able to get Mexico to pay for the border and Trump wasn't just in time for the 2022 midterm elections?\nDoescher: Lora Ries is the director of the Border Security and Immigration Center here at The Heritage Foundation. On this episode, she joins us to cut through the noise of politics and expose the consequences of president Biden's open door policies that have led to more deadly drugs, more hardened criminals escaping into our communities, and of course the devastating reality of migrants dying at record numbers.\nDoescher: And she'll make the case that true border security is actually safety and security for all. Lora, here's a headline from Market Watch, \"Mexican president Lopez [inaudible 00:06:20] agrees in meetings with Biden to fund 1.5 billion in smart border security. White House hails U.S. securing of border funding from Mexico after years of failed efforts to achieve that end by Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump.\" I want your first response to that headline.\nLora Ries: I think the left has been just waiting and itching to throw back in Trump's face when he said, \"We're going to build a big, beautiful wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.\"\nDoescher: Right.\nRies: And the left has always said, \"Well, they didn't pay for it.\" And so now the Biden Administration's getting a little bit of money from Mexico and voila.\nDoescher: Yeah.\nRies: Suddenly Mexico is paying for Biden, \"border security.\"\nDoescher: Yeah. And so it's 1.5 billion over two years. There's some more visas that we're going to extend to Mexico, there's little things, but it seems to me that this is a chance for a headline.\nRies: Exactly, exactly.\nDoescher: Okay. And it doesn't really get to securing the border.\nRies: No. Even when Joe Biden was campaigning for president, any verbiage he would dedicate to border security was more technology at the ports of entry. Now, that's a good thin. It's certainly needed, but he completely ignores everything that happens between the ports of entry. And that's where all the illegal immigration occurs. That's where the drugs cross, the terrorists cross the border, criminal aliens, et cetera.\nRies: And so it looks like they've made some back deal arrangement where Mexico throws a little bit of money to go towards this tech for ports of entry. But that won't affect the historic numbers of illegal aliens and drugs we're currently seeing.\nDoescher: It also seems to me like they can no longer, with the footage that we have at this border, they can no longer pretend like this isn't an issue. On the campaign, they criticized, I mean, they criticized Trump for four years for saying that this is an issue. Just criticizing him for saying it's an issue. And now here, even this seems like an admission. That there is something seriously wrong down there.\nRies: Yeah. During their joint press conference in the White House, even President Biden said historic levels of illegal immigration. And I recall at his most recent state of the union, he said, \"Let's secure the border.\" But for him, these are just words, because his policies don't match that at all.\nRies: We are seeing historic levels of illegal aliens, unaccom\nDoc 3(Title: e, even President Biden said historic levels of illegal immigration. And I recall at his most recent state of the union, he said, \"Let's secure the border.\" But for him, these are just words, because his policies don't match that at all.) Ries: We are seeing historic levels of illegal aliens, unaccompanied alien children, drugs, deaths at the border. All bad records. We've already hit 1.7 million for this fiscal year and we're not even done this fiscal year yet. And that's just year two for Biden. So if we take the number that has been thrown around for decades of 11 million illegal aliens reside in this country, Joe Biden is on track to nearly double that.\nDoescher: We're talking about border security here. But my question is and when you put this, \"Mexico's going to pay for this,\" or not going to pay for this, they're going to pay 1.5 billion for this. My question immediately was, why do we need Mexico to help us secure our border? It seems to me like that's something that we should be doing here, but it's just a pivot, because we can't get anything done or Biden doesn't want the responsibility maybe. I don't know why we need Mexico to do this.\nRies: Well, it's a valid question and this administration doesn't have the will to do it clearly, because they haven't changed course. Personally, I think this is a bit of a kickback. Mexico and many countries, Central America and elsewhere get a very good deal from this country, in that we give them billions of dollars of foreign aid. US is the biggest supplier of foreign aid to Mexico and central America.\nRies: We take their illegal aliens, mostly working age here and we let them come in and we let them stay here and we let them work here, even though that violates multiple laws. And then they send remittances back to their home country, which we don't even touch in the forms of taxes or fees or restrictions.\nRies: It's a great deal for Mexico and these other countries. And yet, we just let it happen. So I think President Lopez [inaudible 00:10:50] from Mexico sees Joe Biden to be weak, like many other leaders around the world do and they are taking advantage. And the fact that Mexico's going to pitch in \"1.5 billion over two years.\" I think for, if you take that out of the remittances Mexico's getting over the years, it's a drop in the bucket.\nDoescher: Do we know who is coming across these borders? Do we have any sense for that? Are we able to apprehend them and then find out, or are people just coming in and having their business?\nRies: Well, most people are turning themselves into the border agents, because they want to be \"processed.\" So what's done with them is basically a biometric check, maybe a quick name check, but the numbers are so high and the lines, so to speak are so large, that basically DHS kind of has to cut corners and just quickly process them north.\nRies: And a good example of this was one person was cleared to enter and then when the name check and the background check was finalized, we discover that he was a wanted known or suspected terrorist and already relocated to Florida. And it took ICE two weeks to get permission to go pick him up and remove him. So that's just one example.\nRies: And those are the people that are turning themselves in to be processed. Meanwhile, we have at least 800,000 got aways, people who don't want to be caught and sneaking across, bringing the drugs. We have to assume there's more known and suspected terrorists and other serious criminals in that large population.\nDoescher: Is there something that states can do about this? Is there something that we should be telling our friends in the states look out for this, watch for this? Because I betcha that for whatever solutions we might have, the left also has solutions and things ready for the states as well. So I'm wondering how you see that as a way of dealing with border security?\nRies: Well, under the law, it's the federal government's job to enforce immigration law, including removin\nDoc 4(Title: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Statement for the Record Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community) \nstic economic agenda.\n\nHowever, Mexico’s $1.15 trillion economy remains vulnerable to investor uncertainty that could\n\nweaken the export sector and slow economic growth, which was just 2 percent in 2017.

Many migrants apparently perceive that traveling\n\nin caravans on the journey north affords a certain level of security, and the decision to do so appears\n\nto result from a combination of individual motivation, encouragement from social media postings,\n\nand politically motivated efforts by some individuals and organizations.\n\n• Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s refusal to heed calls for negotiation amid his political\n\ncrackdown, which has left more than 300 people dead and contributed to allegations of human\n\nrights abuses, threatens to deepen a recession in one of the region’s weakest economies.\n\n42\n\nVenezuela\n\n_**Although the regime of Nicolas Maduro will**_\n\n_**continue to try to maintain power, he is facing**_\n\n_**persistent opposition.**_ Falling oil production,\n\neconomic mismanagement, and legal challenges\n\nalmost certainly will compound the worsening\n\neconomic pressure on the country.

That made all the difference.) Doescher: So and that wasn't even a Congressional thing. That was just basically an enforcement of law that already existed.\nRies: Yeah. It was negotiations in the Executive Branch.\nDoescher: Yeah. So we've got 1.5 billion over the next two years to fix a border crisis, where we saw 207,000 people come across in June. The number isn't really decreasing. It's basically going up. We are seeing more and more people see an opportunity to come illegally into the United States of America. Talk to the Oval Office right now. What is our first step here? Where do we turn this thing around?\nRies: Well, it's not just saying, \"The border is closed or secure. Don't come.\" Secretary [inaudible 00:17:21] has been saying that over and over again. And they're just empty words. Future migrants see that if people can get in successfully, they're going to try it as well. Yeah. So it is actions, not just words.\nRies: It is completing that border wall, not just pouring money into technology at the ports. It is paying attention to what's happening between the ports. But really it all comes down to prevention. And that is what will stop the drugs, it will stop the crime, it will stop the rapes of women and children making the journey, and save a lot more Americans. Rather than allowing it to happen, processing them in and then paying for it on the back end. Whether it's more immigration judges or more asylum officers to adjudicate cases, that's throwing good money after bad. Prevent it to begin with.\nDoescher: Yeah. You keep seeing these photos of all these pills that are, of course doused in fentanyl, that are literally killing our brothers and sisters and friends and family throughout this nation. And it is coming through, a lot of it is coming through our Southern border. This is about security.\nDoescher: This is our security. We don't know if there are terrorists coming through the Southern border. We have no idea because like you said, it is almost just ... they're so overwhelmed, they don't have time to do that. And it seems to me that if we are truly going to look out for our own security and our own wellbeing, securing the border really has to be all hands on deck. And 1.5 billion just doesn't seem enough.\nRies: No, it doesn't. And ironically, the Mexican President said that the US respects Mexico's sovereignty. And yet our president won't uphold our own sovereignty. And that's his number one job, is to protect Americans.

And so we'll keep on having you back in here to give us updates on this. I don't know, maybe we can get another half a billion out of Mexico.

However, this does not necessarily mean that Mexico will start paying immediately or that this amount alone will effectively secure the border. The conversation indicates that the actual implementation and effectiveness of this funding are uncertain, and that the focus should be on prevention rather than just securing the border. The exact timeline for when Mexico will start paying is not explicitly stated, but it seems to be part of a broader agreement that includes changes in immigration policies and increased cooperation. Without a specific timeline, it's difficult to pinpoint when the payments will begin, but it is part of the agreement reached during the meeting between Biden and López Obrador. </think>\n\n<answer> Mexico has agreed to contribute $1.5 billion over two years for smart border technology, but the exact timeline for when payments will start is not specified.

    "question": "Is the TOR network safe?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the documents provided, the Tor network itself is a tool designed to enhance privacy and anonymity. However, the safety of using Tor can be compromised if certain best practices are not followed, such as using the Tor Browser, being cautious about web forms and personal information, avoiding torrenting, and not enabling browser plugins. Additionally, while Tor can protect against some tracking, it does not protect against all forms of surveillance, especially if the user is the only person in their geographical area using Tor. Therefore, the Tor network can be considered relatively safe, but it requires the user to follow good security practices to maximize its benefits.",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> The Tor network is designed to enhance privacy and anonymity on the internet. It routes traffic through multiple nodes to obscure the origin and destination of the data. However, safety can be subjective and depends on various factors including the user's actions and the intentions of potential attackers. </think>\n\n<search> Tor network security </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Am I totally anonymous if I use Tor Browser?) Tor Browser includes many privacy protections, but it cannot guarantee perfect anonymity. Follow these best practices to reduce risks and stay safer online.\nGenerally it is impossible to have perfect anonymity, even with Tor. Though there are some things you can practice to improve your anonymity while using Tor and offline.\nUse Tor Browser and software specifically configured for Tor\nTor does not protect all of your computer's Internet traffic when you run it. Tor only protects applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor.\nControl what information you provide through web forms\nIf you visit a website using Tor Browser, they don't know who you are or your true location. Unfortunately many sites ask for more personal information than they need through web forms. If you sign in to that website, they still don't know your location but they know who you are. Further, if you provide: name, email, address, phone number, or any other personal information, you are no longer anonymous to that website. The best defense is to be vigilant and extremely cautious when filling out web forms.\nDon't torrent over Tor\nTorrent file-sharing applications have been observed to ignore proxy settings and make direct connections even when they are told to use Tor. Even if your torrent application connects only through Tor, you will often send out your real IP address in the tracker GET request, because that's how torrents work. Not only do you deanonymize your torrent traffic and your other simultaneous Tor web traffic this way, you also slow down the entire Tor network for everyone else.\nDon't enable or install browser plugins\nTor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. Similarly, we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and privacy.\nUse HTTPS versions of websites\nTor will encrypt your traffic to and within the Tor network, but the encryption of your traffic to the final destination website depends on that website. To help ensure private encryption to websites, Tor Browser includes HTTPS-Only Mode](../secure-connections/#https-only-mode-in-tor-browser) to force the use of HTTPS encryption with websites that support it. However, you should still watch the browser URL bar to ensure that websites you provide sensitive information to display a padlock or onion icon in the address bar, include https:// in the URL, and display the proper expected name for the website. Also see EFF's interactive graphic explaining how Tor and HTTPS relate.\nDon't open documents downloaded through Tor while online\nTor Browser will warn you before automatically opening documents that are handled by external applications. DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING. You should be very careful when downloading documents via Tor (especially DOC and PDF files, unless you use the PDF viewer that's built into Tor Browser) as these documents can contain Internet resources that will be downloaded outside of Tor by the application that opens them. This will reveal your non-Tor IP address. If you must work with files downloaded via Tor, we strongly recommend either using a disconnected computer, or using dangerzone to create safe PDF files that you can open. Under no circumstances is it safe to use BitTorrent and Tor together, however.\nFind company\nTor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to. However, by default, it does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from learning that you're using Tor. If this matters to you, you can reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a bridge rather than connecting directly to the Tor network. Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it\nDoc 2(Title: re using Tor.

Bush administration began actively pressing for military intervention in Iraq in late 2001. The primary rationalization for the Iraq War was articulated by a joint resolution of the United States Congress known as the Iraq Resolution. The United States intent was to \"disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people\".[1]\nIn the lead-up to the invasion, the United States and the United Kingdom falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction, covertly supporting al-Qaeda, and that he presented a threat to Iraq's neighbors and to the world community. According to the Center for Public Integrity, eight senior-level officials in the Bush administration issued at least 935 false statements in the two years leading up to the war.[2] The US stated, \"On 8 November 2002; the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1441. All 15 members of the Security Council agreed to give Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its obligations and disarm or face the serious consequences of failing to disarm. The resolution strengthened the mandate of the UN Monitoring and Verification Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), giving them the authority to go anywhere, at any time, and talk to anyone in order to verify Iraq's disarmament.\"[3]\nFrom late 2001 to early 2003, the Bush administration worked to build a case for invading Iraq, culminating in then-Secretary of State Colin Powell's February 2003 address to the Security Council.[4] Shortly after the invasion, the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies put forward information which discredited evidence related to Iraqi weapons as well as alleged links to al-Qaeda. The Bush and Blair administrations provided secondary rationales for the war, such as the Saddam Hussein government's human rights record and promoting democracy in Iraq.[5][6]\nOpinion polling showed that people of nearly all countries opposed a war without a UN mandate. Similar polling showed that the perception of the United States as a danger to world peace had significantly increased.[7] UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the war as illegal, saying in a September 2004 interview that it was \"not in conformity with the Security Council\".[8] The US led the effort for \"the redirection of former Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD) scientists, technicians, and engineers to civilian employment and discourage emigration of this community from Iraq\".[9]\nThe US officially declared the end of its combat role in Iraq on the 31 August 2010. Several thousand troops remained in the country until all American troops were withdrawn from Iraq by December 2011. In June 2014, US forces returned to Iraq due to an escalation of instability in the region. In June 2015 the number of American ground troops totaled 3,550. Between December 2011 and June 2014, Department of Defense officials estimated that there were 200 to 300 personnel based at the US embassy in Baghdad.[10]\nBackground\n[edit]The Gulf War had never officially ended due to the lack of an armistice to formally end it. As a result, relations between the United States, the United Nations, and Iraq remained strained. Saddam Hussein issued formal statements renouncing his invasion of Kuwait and made reparation payments following the Gulf War. The US and the United Nations maintained a policy of \"containment\" towards Iraq, which involved economic sanctions, Iraqi no-fly zones enforced by the United States, United Kingdom, and France (until it ended its no-fly zone operations in 1998) and ongoing inspections of Iraqi weapons programs.[11] In 2002, the UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441 demanding that Iraq \"comply wi\nDoc 3(Title: Iraq: A Morally Justified Resort to War) \nlay targeted ads.

Regardless of why Iraq was invaded, it is reasonable to assume that an occupier would exploit rather than destroy its assets. Indeed, the neoconservatives used oil both as an incentive to get the energy industry onside and as a disincentive against dissent, threatening exclusion from future oil contracts. Oil may have played a part in the thinking of some policy makers – as Juan Cole argues it had in Dick Cheney's – but even Cole admits that Iraq was invaded only because the Israel lobby was blocking all other means of access to it. If oil were indeed the overriding concern, it is likelier that we would have US boots on Venezuelan ground. After all, nowhere were US interests more threatened than in Latin America, and few governments had a more provocative attitude towards the US than Hugo Chavez's. Yet, the US was able to do little when the Venezuelan government rewrote laws to claim 30 per cent (up from 16 per cent) of the oil profits for the national oil company.) — Muhammad Idrees Ahmad, The Road to Iraq: The Making of a Neoconservative War[183]\nOther rationales\n[edit]Bringing democracy to the Middle East\n[edit]One of the rationales that the Bush administration employed periodically during the lead-up to the Iraq war was that deposing Saddam Hussein and installing a democratic government in Iraq would promote democracy in other Middle Eastern countries.[187] The United States also proclaimed that the monarchies in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and the military government of Pakistan were American allies, despite the human rights abuses and subversion of democracy attributed to them respectively. As Vice President Cheney argued in an August 2002 speech to the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, \"When the gravest of threats are eliminated, the freedom-loving peoples of the region will have a chance to promote the values that can bring lasting peace.\"[188]\nAt a 2003 Veterans Day address, President Bush stated:[189]\nOur mission in Iraq and Afghanistan is clear to our service members – and clear to our enemies. Our men and women are fighting to secure the freedom of more than 50 million people who recently lived under two of the cruelest dictatorships on earth. Our men and women are fighting to help democracy and peace and justice rise in a troubled and violent region. Our men and women are fighting terrorist enemies thousands of miles away in the heart and center of their power, so that we do not face those enemies in the heart of America.\nEstablishing long-term Middle East military presence\n[edit]US General Jay Garner, who was in charge of planning and administering post-war reconstruction in Iraq, compared the US occupation of Iraq to the Philippine model in a 2004 interview in National Journal: \"Look back on the Philippines around the turn of the 20th century: they were a coaling station for the navy, and that allowed us to keep a great presence in the Pacific. That's what Iraq is for the next few decades: our coaling station that gives us great presence in the Middle East\", \"One of the most important things we can do right now is start getting basing rights with (the Iraqi authorities)\", \"I hope they're there a long time ... And I think we'll have basing rights in the north and basing rights in the south ... we'd want to keep at least a brigade\", Garner added.[190]\nAlso, the House report accompanying the emergency spending legislation said the money was \"of a magnitude normally associated with permanent bases\".[191]\nOther allegations\n[edit]Nabil Shaath told the BBC that according to minutes of a conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Bush said, \"God inspired me to hit al Qaeda, and so I hit it. And I had the inspiration to hit Saddam, and so I hit him.\"[192] Haaretz provided a similar translation of the minutes. When an Arabist at the Washington Post translated the same transcript, Bush was said to have indicated that God inspired him to \"end the tyranny in Iraq\" instead.[193]\nIn a\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the documents, the primary justifications for the Iraq War included:\n- Disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)\n- Ending Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism\n- Freeing the Iraqi people\n- Promoting democracy in the Middle East\n- Establishing a long-term military presence in the Middle East\n\nHowever, it was later discovered that Iraq did not possess WMDs, and there was no credible evidence linking Saddam Hussein to al-Qaeda.

They spent nearly $51.4 million on advertisements at the point of sale alone.\nTobacco industry marketing, advertising and promotions have been found to:\n- Encourage youth smoking uptake.[1, 2, 3, 4] The NCI has demonstrated a causal relationship between exposure to tobacco advertisements and youth smoking uptake. Across multiple studies, research has shown that youth more frequently exposed to tobacco promotion are 60% more likely to have tried smoking and 30% more likely to be susceptible to future smoking.[5] Read more.\n- Increase total cigarette sales.[6, 7]\n- Distort youth perceptions about the availability, use and popularity of cigarettes.[2, 3] Read more on the impact of tobacco retailers near schools and the Center for Public Health and Tobacco Policy’s fact sheet “Influencing Youth at the POS.”\n- Foster positive brand imagery.[8]\n- Cue cravings and undermine quit attempts.[2, 9, 10, 11]\n- Fuel tobacco-related disparities.

Review this presentation by ChangeLab Solutions and the Public Health Law Center to learn more about how the 2009 Act impacts regulation of tobacco advertising and promotions.\nThe Public Health Law Center suggests the following strategies for restricting tobacco advertising at the point of sale. Refer to their guide, “Restricting Tobacco Advertising” for more details:\n- Restrict ALL advertising without regard to its content (“content neutral” advertising restriction). This would affect advertising for all products (e.g. alcohol, food, toys, etc.), not just tobacco. For example, some municipalities limit the percentage of window space that can be taken up by advertisements of any kind, place limits on the size or number of advertisements allowed, or restrict the location of advertisements. Learn more in the Public Health Law Center’s guide to Content-Neutral Advertising Laws.\n- Restrict the content, messages, or imagery within some tobacco advertisements.\n- Restrict the time, place and/or manner (but not the content) of tobacco advertising. The following examples illustrate potential time, place and manner restrictions:\n-\n- Time restrictions: Require retailers to cover or remove advertising during times when youth are present (e.g., after school hours).\n- Place restrictions: Prohibit tobacco advertising at stores near schools or within 10 feet of the cash register. For example, the State of New York has prohibited the display of exterior tobacco advertisements within 1500 feet of schools (500 feet within New York City).\n- Manner restrictions: Prohibit certain types of tobacco advertising (e.g. outdoor signage or sandwich board style ads). For example, Colorado prohibits retailers form advertising e-cigarette products in a manner that is visible from outside.\nYou can implement POS advertising restrictions through three main mechanisms:\n- State or \nDoc 2(Title: ummings KM.

For example, Colorado prohibits retailers form advertising e-cigarette products in a manner that is visible from outside.) You can implement POS advertising restrictions through three main mechanisms:\n- State or local laws or ordinances: Laws can be passed at the state or local level to directly restrict tobacco advertising. The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention & Tobacco Control Act gave state and local governments the authority to enact these restrictions, in order to address public health concerns, especially protecting youth from the harms of tobacco.\n- Licensing laws: Advertising restrictions can be incorporated as stipulations (or “plug-ins”) of tobacco retail licensing. See Counter Tobacco’s page on Licensing and Zoning for more information about tobacco retail licensing. Licensing laws that affect the density, location or type of tobacco retailers will also inherently reduce exposure to POS advertising.\n- Zoning laws: Zoning laws can restrict advertising for retailers in certain zones. Some communities have “sign laws” that regulate how advertisements can be posted, which are usually content neutral restrictions. See Counter Tobacco’s page on Licensing and Zoning for more information about zoning. Zoning regulations that impact the density, location or type of tobacco retailers will also inherently reduce exposure to POS advertising.\nAnother way to reduce exposure to tobacco advertising at the point of sale is through more comprehensive tobacco control policies, including limits on the the number of retailers in a community that can sell tobacco, restrictions on the types of products sold, and/or prohibiting price promotions and discounts.[18] For example, a study evaluating the impacts of restrictions on the sale of flavored tobacco products found that in cities with restrictions on the sale of flavored tobacco products, exterior store advertising for tobacco products overall decreased following implementation of the policies to a greater extent than cities without a restriction in place.[19]\nThe evidence for implementing POS advertising restrictions\nThe tobacco industry channels the vast majority of its marketing expenditures to the point of sale, making POS advertising restrictions a critical strategy to subvert industry attempts to attract new, current, and recently quit smokers. Since few US states and localities have successfully implemented POS advertising restrictions, their impact in the US is not well known, but they are expected to reverse some of the effects of advertising, such as reducing youth uptake, reducing tobacco-related disparities, and changing norms about tobacco use. In fact, a global study recently showed that POS advertising bans reduce experimental smoking among youth by 31%.[14] The World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control calls for comprehensive restrictions on tobacco advertising and international studies have found that these policies do in fact reduce consumption[15] and perceived prevalence of smoking by youth.[16] To learn more about limiting product displays and “power walls,” which the tobacco industry consider part of its advertising strategy, visit our page on restricting tobacco product placement.\nAfter conducting retail store assessments at all 26 retailers in Bamberg County and receiving training on point-of-sale tobacco control from Counter Tools, the Tri-County Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCCADA) was looking for next steps to help address the glut of tobacco marketing present in their community.

This study examines the immediate and long term effectiveness of advertising restrictions enacted in different countries on exposure to different forms of product marketing, and examines differences in exposure across different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Nationally representative data from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the United States, collected from adult smokers between 2002 and 2008 using the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4), were used in this study (N = 21,615). In light of the specific marketing regulation changes that occurred during the course of this study period, changes in awareness of tobacco marketing via various channels were assessed for each country, and for different SES groups within countries. Tobacco marketing regulations, once implemented, were associated with significant reductions in smokers’ reported awareness of pro-smoking cues, and the observed reductions were greatest immediately following the enactment of regulations. Changes in reported awareness were generally the same across different SES groups, although some exceptions were noted. While tobacco marketing regulations have been effective in reducing exposure to certain types of product marketing there still remain gaps, especially with regard to in-store marketing and price promotions.\nKeywords: tobacco control, marketing regulation, socioeconomic differences, public policy\n1. Introduction\nMarketing theory suggests several mechanisms through which tobacco advertising and promotion can be effective, including: increasing experimentation with/initiation of smoking, increasing individuals’ cigarette consumption, decreasing quit attempts/quit success rates, and enticing former smokers to begin smoking again [1]. Empirical research confirms the role that marketing plays in fostering positive smoking attitudes and expectations among adolescents which, in turn, increases their likelihood of becoming smokers [2,3]. Marketing efforts have also been successful in portraying smoking as being normal and socially acceptable to adults, making it less likely for current smokers to feel compelled to quit [4,5]. Further, the presence of tobacco advertisements in stores, particularly cigarette displays, makes it harder for smokers who try to quit smoking to be successful in doing so [6].\nGiven the harmful influence of tobacco advertising and promotion on current, potential, and former smokers, marketing regulation is a necessary component in the effort to combat the global tobacco epidemic. The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the WHO FCTC) has responded by calling on member Parties to implement extensive tobacco regulatory strategies, including the enactment of comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship activities [7]. Such bans have been shown to be effective in reducing tobacco consumption, both in developed countries [8] and in developing countries [9].\nSince 2002, various tobacco marketing regulations have been enacted in the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Australia and the United States. Table 1 presents an overview of the extent of these marketing regulations in each of the four countries.\nTable 1.\nX = complete ban, O = partial ban, - = no ban.\nIn the UK, the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 (TAPA) banned almost all types of tobacco marketing according to the following timeline: by 2003, print and broadcast media, billboard advertisements, arts sponsorships, and free sample, special price, gift/discount, leaflet, Internet, and email promotions were banned [10]. Sports sponsorships were partially banned in 2003 and completely banned by\nDoc 5(Title: stitute (USA), University of Strathclyde (UK), University of Stirling (UK), The Open University (UK), and The Cancer Council Victoria (Australia).)

    "question": "What percentage of Hillary Clinton's supporters has voted for her just because of her gender?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the articles, while there is no exact percentage provided, it is clear that gender does play a significant role in the support for Hillary Clinton, particularly among white men. Social science evidence, primary exit polls, and interviews with voters indicate that white men's attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. Some men explicitly stated that they would not vote for her because she is a woman. However, the exact percentage of Clinton's supporters who voted for her just because of her gender is not provided in these sources.",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> To answer this question accurately, I would need data on Hillary Clinton's supporters and their motivations. However, such specific data on individual supporter motivations is not publicly available or easily accessible. </think>\n<search> \"Hillary Clinton supporters gender motivation\" </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.) Obviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voters. She has real shortcomings, like any male or female candidate. They were evident in her failure to put Sanders away early on in the primaries. Her national approval ratings are remarkably low for a presidential nominee, and part of that can be traced to men and women across the political spectrum who have legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton (though her likeability numbers are gendered as well; and of course some women hold subconscious biases towards female candidates, too). White men began abandoning the Democratic Party in the 1960s, for reasons that had nothing to do with gender. The trend accelerated under Ronald Reagan and shows no signs of slowing today.\nStill, social science evidence, primary exit polls and my interviews with researchers and dozens of voters indicate that white men’s attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. “The gender issue, people say it shouldn’t matter anymore,” said Nancy Mills, a member of the Democratic National Committee and longtime powerbroker in Pennsylvania politics. “But it always matters because it exists. You can’t ignore it and make it go away.”\nSocial psychology research tells us that everyone thinks they’re not prejudiced, and everyone is wrong. We all have built-in biases, whether we recognize them or not. I spoke to white men across Pennsylvania and Ohio last month for this story — Democrats and Republicans, old men and young guys, middle class professionals and blue-collar workers. They all insisted that they weren’t sexist. Nevertheless, many said they were uncomfortable with the thought of a female president.\n“Bias in general, whether it’s directed at gender, race, or anything else, is more automatic than people think,” said Susan Fiske, a leading researcher on prejudice and stereotypes who teaches at Princeton University. “And it’s also more ambivalent than we realize. So that makes it harder to detect in ourselves.”\nI should say here that my goal is not to mansplain the way that sexism works to people who already get it. Rather, it’s to work through a thorny issue at the heart of this election that many men, like myself, probably haven’t spent as much time thinking about as we should. We don’t have to if we don’t want to, which is just one of many unfair privileges that come with being a man.\nIt can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You're either racist or you're not. But actually, it's not that simple.\nThe theory of ambivalent sexism, more than anything else, helps illustrate men’s subconscious bias against Clinton, but it’s hard to understand — at least it was for me — because it clashes with many people’s ideas about prejudice. It can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You’re either racist or you’re not. The same thinking applied to gender up until the mid-1990s. That’s when Fiske, working with Peter Glick, a social psychologist at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, published a breakthrough paper that laid out their ambivalent sexism theory. The theory, which has since been accepted by researchers around the world, helped form the basis for how experts study sexism today. Fiske and Glick separated sexism into two distinct categories. The first kind, known as “hostile” sexism, encompasses overtly negative views about women. It’s what we usually associate with gender discrimination. The second kind, known as “benevolent” sexism, describes positive attitudes and actions which men take toward women that are based, deep-down, in feelings of superiority and dominance.\n“Men have ambivalent attitudes toward women that are prejudiced and paternalistic, but that are also based on lo\nDoc 2(Title: n. The second kind, known as “benevolent” sexism, describes positive attitudes and actions which men take toward women that are based, deep-down, in feelings of superiority and dominance.) “Men have ambivalent attitudes toward women that are prejudiced and paternalistic, but that are also based on love and interdependence,” Glick said. In other words, we can say we like women and really mean it while also harboring a combination of conflicting biases that we don’t even realize exist. If that sounds confusing, it’s because it is. For any male readers out there who might want to grapple with this some more: the next time you offer to carry your wife or girlfriend or female friend’s heavy shopping bag, or go on a drive with a member of the opposite sex and insist on doing all of the driving, try and honestly break down the gender dynamic. Sure, you mean well. But it may not be that simple.\nTommy McKelvey, 20, says he plans to vote for Trump in the fall and wants to see a female president, just not Clinton.\nWhen it comes to politics and the 2016 presidential election, hostile sexism plays out in obvious ways. We have Trump to thank for that. He has insulted the physical appearance of Carly Fiorina, his lone female primary opponent (“Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?”), and attacked FOX News host Megyn Kelly (“She had blood coming out of her wherever”) after Kelly highlighted his long track record of misogynist comments at a Republican debate. The list goes on and on from there. For Clinton, however, the root of her problem with white men stems from a central aspect of benevolent sexism, according to Glick: its use as a tool to reward women who accept traditional gender roles, and punish those who don’t. Any first lady who was discouraged from meddling in her husband’s policy work, and received lavish praise for the food at a White House function, has first-hand experience of benevolent sexism.\nThe more female politicians are seen as striving for power, the less they’re trusted and the more moral outrage gets directed at them.\n—Terri Vescio, psychology professor at Penn State\nAnd this is the crux of the gender issue for Clinton. An extensive body of research has shown that women who seek leadership positions often encounter resistance from both men and women if they violate gender norms by acting in stereotypically masculine ways, like being competitive, assertive and self-promotional. This is known among social psychologists as the \"backlash\" effect, and examples abound. For instance, though there are more women in middle-management positions in the business world today than there were in previous generations, just 4.2 percent of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are female. The backlash effect extends to politics, too. Dozens of women have run for president in the U.S., but Clinton is the only one who’s ever come close.\n“The more female politicians are seen as striving for power, the less they’re trusted and the more moral outrage gets directed at them,” said Terri Vescio, a psychology professor at Penn State who studies gender bias. “You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t,” she continued. “If you’re perceived as competent, you’re not perceived as warm. But if you’re liked and trusted, you’re not seen as competent.”\nWomen in politics know this well. “I think a woman has a hard time running as a woman,” said Eleanor Holmes Norton, a veteran civil and women’s rights leader who represents the District of Columbia in Congress. “Even as Donald Trump is running openly and with great aplomb as a man.”\nThis theoretical framework is extremely useful in decoding the real-life views of male voters like Tomi McKelvey, a 20-year-old beer store clerk who grew up in Dravosburg, a working-class town outside of Pittsburgh. McKelvey’s father is a steel mill worker, and his mother is an accountant. He was an offensive lineman on his high school football team, and moves with the gracefulness of a former athlete. McKelvey, who is whi\nDoc 3(Title:  meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage. She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter that this is the first time a major party is picking a woman to be its nominee? Johnny McMahan, 65, a GOP delegate from Arkansas, said he had no problem with a woman being president but some of his friends felt differently. “They say women are too emotional to be president,” McMahan said. Though assailing the opposing candidate is standard fare at political conventions, this year the attacks have transcended policy positions and become intimately personal. The relentless spotlight on an opponent’s supposed criminality is another departure. Republicans maintain Clinton broke the law by sending classified information on her private email server. Trump’s campaign has worked to sow distrust by using vague insinuations against Clinton that are hard to prove or disprove. On Wednesday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort mused that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had “probably” given special information to Bill Clinton that helped his wife avoid criminal charges, during a brief airport meeting that Lynch has acknowledged was a mistake. He said the “Lock her up!” chant punctuating speeches at the conventions “probably reflects the attitude of a lot of people in America.” “They don’t understand why justice wasn’t done,” he said.

Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean tow\nDoc 4(Title: Election 2016) The hidden sexism that could sway the election\nBy Daniel Bush\nPhotography by Greg Neiser and Kevin Kopanski\nDesign by Megan Crigger and Vanessa Dennis\nEdited by Jenny Marder and Travis Daub\nArmando Manno was in a good mood. His bartending shift at Louie's Bar & Grill in Akron, Ohio was almost over, and the Cleveland Cavaliers were ahead in the first quarter of a pivotal playoff game. It was May 25, near the end of the primary season, and talk had shifted to the presidential election. “Trump is going to make the right moves,” Manno, the son of Italian immigrants and a lifelong Republican, said as he wiped down the bar. “You don’t become a gazillionaire if you don’t know what you’re doing. He’s gotta have something upstairs.” As for Hillary Clinton, Manno said that he didn't want her in the White House. She was untrustworthy and willing to say anything to get elected, he said. And she possessed another, more fundamental shortcoming, Manno added: her gender. “Nothing against women,\" he said, \"but I don’t want a woman president right now.”\nManno laughed and gave a sheepish, that’s-just-how-I-feel shrug. As he turned away, a waitress named Mary Stone quietly offered a different point of view. Though she’s also planning to vote for Trump in the fall, Stone said she could relate to the cultural barriers that Clinton faces as a woman. “Men are still chauvinistic enough to think that women can’t do the same job as them. And I think that’s an issue.”\nHeading into the general election, Clinton has a wide lead over Donald Trump among minority and female voters. But Clinton, who made history last week as the first woman to clinch the nomination of a major U.S. party, has struggled with the one big voting bloc that’s truly up for grabs in 2016: moderate white men. White men also happen to be Trump’s base. If he doesn’t get a record number of them to turn out, it’s hard to see how he wins the presidency. Women, African-Americans, and Latinos will still play a crucial role in the race. They skew Democratic and anti-Trump. If Clinton keeps that coalition together, she can afford to lose some white men. But she can’t afford to lose too many.\nThe Clinton campaign knows this. Clinton spent significant time in the primaries courting white male voters — in particular white, mostly working-class men in the key Rust Belt and Midwestern swing states that usually decide presidential elections. And yet, despite all the effort, the results were abysmal. Clinton lost the overall male vote to Bernie Sanders by an average of 10 points in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin, according to an analysis of exit poll data. She also lost men by double-digits in states as varied as Nevada, Connecticut and Oklahoma. In contrast, she won the male vote by wide margins in states that have large numbers of African-American and Latino voters. In short, white men are the last holdout.\nBrian Brown, a registered Independent, on his motorcycle in downtown Canton, Ohio. Brown said that he thinks Hillary Clinton's gender will be an obstacle for some voters in the general election. \"There will be people who won’t vote for her because she’s a woman,\" Brown said. Right: The white male vote in Canton and other Rust Belt cities and towns will play a large role in the general election.\nFemale candidates have long faced more resistance, and received less support from men and women alike, even though the percentage of people who say they feel comfortable voting for women has gone steadily up. In 1937, just 33 percent of Americans said they would vote for a female presidential candidate, according to Gallup's first poll on the subject. By 2015, that number had climbed to 92 percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.\nObviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voter\nDoc 5(Title: d beer store clerk who grew up in Dravosburg, a working-class town outside of Pittsburgh. McKelvey’s father is a steel mill worker, and his mother is an accountant. He was an offensive lineman on his high school football team, and moves with the gracefulness of a former athlete. McKelvey, who is white, described himself as a moderate Republican. He disagrees with Trump’s most inflammatory proposals, such as banning Muslim immigrants from entering the country. Still, he voted for Trump in the primary and is planning to back him again in the general election. He fits into Trump’s target demographic. If enough people like Tomi McKelvey vote for Trump, he has a real shot.) McKelvey told me he didn’t like or trust Clinton. He said he wants a woman to become president someday, but didn’t think that Clinton was the “right one.”\n“I’m not a real Hillary fan, but I respect her,” McKelvey said.\nWhen I asked him at another point if he viewed male and female roles in society any differently, McKelvey replied, “With a man you look for leadership and guidance. With a woman you look for companionship and nurturing. A motherly role.”\nMcKelvey isn’t unique in thinking this way. Many Americans have been conditioned to assign men and women prescribed gender roles. And when Clinton goes off-script, which she did a long time ago, and acts like a politician — that is to say, no different than a man — science shows that McKelvey and the rest of us are wired to judge her differently, and more negatively, than her male competition. That’s the double standard at work, and that’s the point. It is very real, and it has a profound effect on our view of men, women, and who gets to have the power.\nThe Iowa Democratic caucuses were a turning point in 2008. Barack Obama’s surprise victory signaled that whites would vote for a black candidate, instantly turning him into a true contender. But in 2016, Clinton had to wait much longer (until the end of the primaries) for her version of an “Iowa” moment — a primary win or key speech that the country interpreted as a critical shift in gender relations. Like Obama, Clinton also made history in Iowa, but her win didn’t symbolize a decisive change in how men view female politicians. The exit polls and Sanders’ improbably close second-place finish told the opposite story. Clinton won with women and non-white voters. But she lost the male vote in Iowa by 14 points.\nAn overtly gendered narrative emerged, pitting Sanders’ inspiring political “revolution” against Clinton’s plodding, eat-your-vegetables “march” to the nomination.\nIowa set the pattern for the rest of the primaries. An overtly gendered narrative emerged, pitting Sanders’ inspiring political “revolution” against Clinton’s plodding, eat-your-vegetables “march” to the nomination. There were times when Clinton allowed herself to stop and enjoy the moment. On the night of her landslide win in South Carolina in late February, Clinton took the stage at a college gym in downtown Columbia looking visibly relieved. The results made clear that Clinton would win big with minority voters, and build an insurmountable delegate lead. Super Tuesday was still one week away, but at that point her Democratic primary battle with Sanders was effectively over.\nThe atmosphere at her South Carolina primary night rally was celebratory. But the win represented a bittersweet tradeoff for advocates of gender equality, regardless of their political affiliation. Yes, Clinton was going to win the nomination, but largely because women and non-white voters were supporting her candidacy. White men appeared much more comfortable voting for Sanders.\nThat’s exactly what ended up happening. In the months that followed, Clinton won diverse states and Sanders carried predominantly white ones. The racial divide was startling. During one stretch in late March and early April, when Sanders won seven consecutive contests, the Democratic electorate in the states that he carried was on average 72 percent wh\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the articles, while there is no exact percentage provided, it is clear that gender does play a significant role in the support for Hillary Clinton, particularly among white men.

The key factors were likely Sanders' inability to win over conservative voters and the perception that he was not strong enough to defeat Trump in the general election.\n\nIf Bernie Sanders had become the Democratic nominee again, several factors could influence the outcome:\n\n1. **Campaign Strategy**: Sanders might have adjusted his strategy based on what he learned from the 2016 loss.\n2. **External Factors**: Events like the coronavirus pandemic or economic downturns could affect voter sentiment.\n3. **Voter Base**: The composition of the Democratic and Republican bases could change, affecting the outcome.\n4. **Third Parties**: The presence or absence of third-party candidates could also impact the race.\n\nGiven these uncertainties, a direct comparison is difficult.

Sanders refused to formally concede before the convention.[268] He spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. He responded, \"Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton ... It is easy to boo, but it is harder to look your kids in the face if we are living under a Trump presidency.\"[269]\nOn November 8, in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in Vermont, even though he was no longer a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a write-in draft campaign in American history.[270] He also received more votes in Vermont than Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, and Jill Stein, the Green candidate, combined.[271] It was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states,[272] and exact totals of write-in votes for him were published in three of them: California,[273] New Hampshire,[274] and Vermont.[271] In those three states, he received 111,850 write-in votes, about 15% of the write-in votes nationwide, and less than 1% of total nationwide vote.[272]\nPost-election activities\nIn November 2016, Sanders's book Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In was released; upon its release, it was number three on The New York Times Best Seller list.[275] The audiobook later received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.[276] In February 2017, he began webcasting The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook live streaming. As of April 2, 2017[update], guests had included William Barber, Josh Fox, Jane Mayer, and Bill Nye.[277][278] Polls taken in 2017 found him to be the most popular politician in the United States.[217][279]\nIn February 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US elections concluded that Russians had communicated false information during the primary campaigns to help Sanders and Stein and harm Clinton.[280] Sanders rejected the investigation's conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign.[281] Furthermore, he questioned the Clinton campaign's lack of action to prevent Russian interference.[281] He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign.[282] Politico noted that a Sanders campaign volunteer contacted a political action committee (PAC) that supported the Clinton campaign to report suspicious activities but that the Sanders campaign did not contact the Clinton campaign as such.[282]\nIn November 2018, the Sanders Institute and Yanis Varoufakis, co-founder of DiEM25, launched Progressive International, an international organization uniting progressive activists and organizations \"to mobilize people around the world to transform the global order and the institutions that shape it.\"[283][284][285]\nInfluence on the Democratic Party\nAnalysts have suggested that Sanders's campaign shifted both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party politically leftward. A new political organization, Brand New Congress, was formed in April 2016 by former campaign staffers. It works to elect congressional representatives with platforms in line with Sanders.[286] In August 2016, he formed Our Revolution, a political organization dedicated to educating voters about issues, getting people involved in the political process, and electing progressive candidates for local, sta\nDoc 3(Title: ginal on October 14, 2008.

It began with Sanders's formal announcement on February 19, 2019. The announcement followed widespread speculation that he would run again after running unsuccessfully in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries.\nSanders consistently polled among the top three Democratic candidates nationally. Sanders raised $6 million in the first 24 hours of his announcement, beating out Kamala Harris's $1.6 million for the highest amount raised on day one. Sanders raised $10 million in the first week since launching his campaign. Within each of the four quarters of 2019, Sanders' campaign raised $18.2 million, $18 million, $25.3 million, and $34.5 million, respectively. In the first, third and fourth quarters, the campaign had the largest haul for any candidate in the Democratic field. In the second quarter, he was outraised by Elizabeth Warren.[12] On September 19, 2019, Sanders' campaign announced that they had reached 1 million individual donors, becoming the fastest presidential campaign in history to do so. As of January 2020, Sanders had raised more money than any other Democratic candidate, and only self-funded billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg had more cash on hand.[13]\nThe national co-chairs of the campaign were Ben & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen, U.S. representative Ro Khanna, Our Revolution president Nina Turner, and San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.[4] The campaign manager was Faiz Shakir.[5]\nSanders suspended his presidential campaign on April 8, 2020,[1] following a string of losses to his chief rival Joe Biden and a dwindling path to the nomination.[14] He endorsed Biden on April 13.[15]\nBackground\n[edit]Sanders' 2020 campaign was his second run for the Democratic nomination, following his campaign in the 2016 primaries.[16] He entered the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries as a heavyweight candidate, as compared to his prior 2016 underdog campaign.[17] Had Sanders won the presidency, he would have been the first Jewish president and the oldest president at the time of inauguration.\nSanders joined the 2020 race with the advantages of a large online donor base and having his policy ideas accepted into the Democratic mainstream.[18] In a crowded field of primary candidates, Sanders had the largest infrastructure in waiting but was likely to see his supporter base fragmented, as compared to his head-to-head campaign in 2016.[19] While policies such as single-payer healthcare and tuition-free public colleges have entered mainstream Democratic thought since his 2016 campaign, some Democratic leaders doubted the breadth of his appeal.[18]\nOn February 19, 2019, Sanders announced on Vermont Public Radio that he was running for the 2020 United States presidential election.[20] On the same day, he announced his campaign in an email to his supporters and in an interview with John Dickerson on CBS This Morning.[21]\nCampaign\n[edit]On March 15, 2019, Sanders' campaign announced that its workers had unionized with UFCW Local 400, making it the first-ever major presidential campaign with a unionized workforce.[22] The Sanders campaign promised to offset its greenhouse gas emissions while traveling by contributing to renewable energy projects.[23]\nStaff and leadership\n[edit]On February 21, 2019, Sanders' campaign announced its national campaign co-chairs: Ben & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen, Rep. Ro Khanna, Our Revolution president Nina Turner, and San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.[4]\nThe campaign manager was Faiz Shakir,[5] the political director was Analilia Mejia,[6] and the communications director was Carli Stevenson.[9] Other staff and advisors included deputy political director Sarah Badawi and senior advisor for the campaign Chuck Rocha;[6] deputy press secretary Belén Sisa;[24] senior advisors Phillip Agnew, Pete D’Alessandro and Kurt Ehrenberg;[2\nDoc 5(Title: election,[459] and after Biden withdrew from the race, Sanders endorsed Harris for president at the Democratic National Convention.[460] Sanders attempted to appeal to pro-Palestinian critics of Harris by saying, \"I promise you, after Kamala wins, we will together do everything that we can to change US policy toward Netanyahu\", and emphasizing Donald Trump's policies on climate change, minimum wage, and tax cuts for the wealthy.[461]) Second Trump administration\nTrump's reelection in 2024 was met with consternation by Democrats. The three richest men in America attended Trump's second inauguration, and Elon Musk's formation of DOGE, as well as the enactment of Project 2025, were seen as myopic and unconstitutional, featuring policies such as reducing taxes on corporations and capital gains, instituting a flat income tax on individuals,[462] cutting Medicare and Medicaid,[463][464] reversing President Joe Biden's policies, and reducing environmental protections.[465][466] After Trump won the election, Sanders released a statement blaming the Democratic Party's abandonment of \"working-class people\" for its defeat.[467] In February 2025, Sanders began the \"Fighting Oligarchy Tour\", in which he and Ocasio-Cortez held rallies criticizing Trump's policies and economic inequality.[468][469] In April 2025, Sanders criticized the administration, saying that its moving \"rapidly toward oligarchy\", he also called US a \"pseudo-democracy\".[470]\nAt one rally held in June 2025, Sanders reacted to news of Trump's bombing of Iranian nuclear sites by saying: \"The American people are being lied to again today. We cannot allow history to repeat itself\".[471][472] Also in June, Sanders endorsed progressive politician and DSA member Zohran Mamdani for the 2025 New York City Democratic mayoral primary, calling him \"best choice\" for mayor.[473] In September 2025, Sanders criticized Democratic Party officials for their perceived refusal to support Mamdani after his victory in the New York City mayoral primary.[474] In the same month, Sanders gave an interview to Mamdani in which they discussed Sanders's political beginnings and his achievements as a mayor and senator.[475] On September 15, 2025, Sanders said that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, becoming the first US senator to make such comment.[476]\nParty affiliations\nBorn into a Democratic-voting family, Sanders was first introduced to political activism when his brother Larry joined the Young Democrats of America and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1956.[477] Sanders joined Vermont's Liberty Union Party in 1971 and was a candidate for several offices, never coming close to winning election. He became party chairman,[478] but quit in 1977 to become an independent.[479] In 1980, he served as an elector for the Socialist Workers Party.[480][481] In 1981, Sanders ran as an independent for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and defeated the Democratic incumbent; he was reelected three times.[81] Although an independent, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidates Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988. His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that \"if you go around saying that Mondale would be a great president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite\"), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically.[482] The Washington Post reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.[482][3]\nSanders attended the 1983 conference of the Socialist Party USA where he gave a speech.[483]\nSanders first ran for the US House of Representatives in 1988 and for the US Senate in 2006, often adopting a strategy of winning the Democratic Party primary, thereby eliminating Democratic challengers, and then running as an independent in the general election.[484] He continued this strategy through his reelection in the 2018 United States Senate election in Vermont.[485] Throughout his tenure in Congress, he has been listed as an independent.

In the general election, he received a significant number of write-in votes, indicating some level of support, but ultimately lost to Donald Trump. \n\nIf Bernie Sanders had won the Democratic nomination in 2020, he would have faced Donald Trump again in the general election. Historical data and expert analysis suggest that while Sanders might have had a better chance than Hillary Clinton in 2016, he still would likely face significant challenges in defeating Trump. The key factors would include Sanders' ability to appeal to swing voters and the overall political climate of the time.

    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it's clear that Russia had a preference for Trump winning the 2016 election, as evidenced by the intelligence community report that Putin ordered an influence campaign aimed at the U.S. presidential election. However, the actual preference for Trump was more about weakening Clinton rather than supporting Trump. \n\nSince Trump's presidency, Russia's stance has been mixed. While Putin congratulated Trump on his victory and there was a brief period where Putin's favorability in the U.S. increased, relations have deteriorated again, particularly after Trump took office. Putin has accused Hillary Clinton of interfering in Russia's internal affairs, and there have been multiple instances of tension, such as the suspension of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty and the announcement of stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\n\nOverall, Russia seems to have preferred Trump because of the potential for less stringent foreign policy and a more favorable attitude towards Russia. However, the deterioration in relations suggests that Russia may have found Trump's policies and actions less predictable and potentially more challenging than expected. </think>\n\n<answer> Russia initially favored Trump's presidency because of the potential for less stringent foreign policy and a more favorable attitude towards Russia, as indicated by the intelligence community report suggesting Putin's preference for Trump.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> To answer this question, I need to consider Russia's historical stance on U.S. presidents and any recent actions or statements that might indicate a preference.\n\nRussia has traditionally had a complex relationship with both major U.S. political parties. In the past, Russia has supported anti-establishment candidates when they align with Russian interests, such as Donald Trump in 2016. However, Russia also has interests in maintaining stability and predictability in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nGiven the current state of U.S.-Russia relations and Russia's strategic interests, it is more likely that Russia would prefer a continuation of the existing policies under a Biden administration, which might offer more stability in areas like arms control and cooperation on global issues.\n\nI should check for any recent statements or actions from Russian officials to confirm this. </think>\n\n<search> Russia's stance on Trump vs. Clinton presidency </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: tings with members of Congress he will not be doing Russians’ bidding as the U.S. secretary of state. His confirmation hearings will provide greater insight into the way he views the Russians and America’s role in the world, more generally.) Let's address the Russian hacking matter. First, the recent intelligence community report concluded that Russia was, in fact, behind the cyber-attacks on the Republican National Committee (RNC), the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and operatives’ emails. The report, a consensus document, prepared by the CIA, NSA, and FBI concluded: “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”\nConsidering the Russian government, just like any other foreign government who sees the United States as an adversary, engages in regular cyber-attacks, it takes very little to persuade me that it was the Russians behind the hacks.\nNote, however, that the motives, agreed to by the three intelligence agencies, were not to elect Donald Trump. Analysis that said so would hardly make sense. According to the Wall Street Journal, the techniques used to infiltrate the DNC were also used in an attempt to infiltrate the RNC, only the RNC’s security measures blocked the attempts. Moreover, the timing of the security breaches also work against the theory that the original motivations were to help Donald Trump. The first breach took place in the summer of 2015, the second in April of 2016. Recall, Donald Trump didn’t even officially win the Republican nomination until July 2016. It makes a lot more sense that the Russians, like nearly everyone else on Planet Earth, believed Hillary Clinton would win the election, and they were busy digging up damaging information to weaken and use as leverage against her.\nThe intelligence community also revealed high-level Russians cheered upon learning Donald Trump won the election. Much could be said about this, but, in short, some Russians cheered President Obama’s election, and the Community Party USA backed Hillary Clinton. In other words, it means nothing.\nThe President-elect has been notably defensive about the conclusions of the intelligence community, so what about that? Does it at least imply he is defensive of the Russian government and naive to an alarming degree about the nature of the Russians’ desire to cause upheaval in the American democratic process? After President-elect Trump received a personal briefing from the intelligence agencies, he responded: \"While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat [sic] National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.” Those are not the words of someone who seems to be clueless about the constant cyber attacks adversaries launch against the United States—including Russia. They are the words of someone who is keenly aware that the media and those insufferably determined to look at the incoming Trump administration with as little charity as possible are using the Russian cyber-attacks to delegitimize the American election outcome.\nThe Obama administration started its first term speaking positively about Russia; it was willing to capitulate on matters important to Russia in an effort to appease it (i.e. the U.S. missile defense system); it powered through with the nuclear arms reduction treaty, New START, even though there is evidence it did so while concealing to Congress that Russia was in violation, and remains in violation, of a\nDoc 2(Title: te on matters important to Russia in an effort to appease it (i.e. the U.S. missile defense system); it powered through with the nuclear arms reduction treaty, New START, even though there is evidence it did so while concealing to Congress that Russia was in violation, and remains in violation, of another arms control treaty, the INF Treaty and engages in nuclear saber-rattling; it paid little notice to the Russians harassing U.S. diplomats; it allowed Russia to harass the U.S. Navy in international waters; and it permitted Russia to protect and empower the dictator Bashar al-Assad and partake in the brutal onslaught of the Syrian people, to name just a few.) It’s little wonder the incoming President might be resisting the lame-duck President’s efforts to make this Russian infraction the one that calls Russia out as a true enemy.\nNow, let’s address the rhetoric from Trump regarding Russia and its leaders. Trump has called Putin a leader for his country and has accepted Putin’s compliments directed at him.\nEach statement directed towards Putin is worth examining, but, for example, Trump got members of the anti-Trump intelligentsia really clutching their pearls when he quipped, \"Russia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by the press.\"\nThe response from Camp Clinton was remarkable. Jake Sullivan, Clinton’s chief foreign policy adviser, said, “This has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national security issue.” But, many of us who followed Clinton’s shameful and illegal handling of highly classified documents and her mysteriously disappearing 30,000-plus emails wondered, “If those emails were harmless, why would Russia finding them create a national security issue?”\nOr, put another way, as Charles Krauthammer observed, “Whether or not [Trump] made [the Russia comments] seriously or not, could have been sarcastic or sort of half sarcastic as a way to plant the idea. The fact is that it leaves the Clinton campaign in a complete contradiction. If these are just private e-mails, then there is nothing to be concerned about. There’s no espionage. There is no danger to national security. I mean, they will discover her yoga lesson schedule.” Indeed.\nEach one of Trump’s statements regarding Russia has been relatively cordial, it’s true.\nBut, whether intentionally or not, some of them, especially this one, appears to have another political meaning, and effect. But, to be sure, categorically none of the comments rises to level of evidence that America’s new Commander in Chief seeks a grand alliance with Moscow. Is it possible, then, if one takes Trump’s statements toward and about Russia within the context of Trump’s overarching themes regarding what America’s standing in the world ought to be and with full view of his stated foreign policy goals, that Trump is doing something far more clever than what people give him credit for? I think so. And that brings me to the last point.\nTrump has consistently argued for investing in and modernizing America’s military. Most importantly, he has identified the employment of nuclear weapons as a major threat he would like to avoid, and recently stated, \"The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”\nHe is absolutely right. The United States has been lowering the number of its nuclear weapons for decades in the hopes that other countries would be motivated to eschew nuclear strength as well. In addition, the United States has allowed its nuclear force to age without adequate modernization.

President\nDoc 3(Title: medieval calls for crusades\".[281]) In late 2013, Russian-American relations deteriorated further when the United States canceled a summit for the first time since 1960 after Putin gave asylum to the American Edward Snowden, who had leaked massive amounts of classified information from the NSA.[282][283] In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 group as a result of its annexation of Crimea.[284][285] Putin gave a speech highly critical of the United States, accusing them of destabilizing world order and trying to \"reshape the world\" to its own benefit.[286] In June 2015, Putin said that Russia has no intention of attacking NATO.[287]\nOn 9 November 2016, Putin congratulated Donald Trump on becoming the 45th president of the United States.[288] In December 2016, US intelligence officials (headed by James Clapper) quoted by CBS News stated that Putin approved the email hacking and cyber attacks during the U.S. election, against the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. A spokesman for Putin denied the reports.[289] Putin has repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton, who served as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 of interfering in Russia's internal affairs,[290] and in December 2016, Clinton accused Putin of having a personal grudge against her.[291][292]\nWith the election of Trump, Putin's favorability in the U.S. increased. A Gallup poll in February 2017 revealed a positive view of Putin among 22% of Americans, the highest since 2003.[293] Putin has stated that U.S.–Russian relations, already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War,[294] have continued to deteriorate after Trump took office in January 2017.[295]\nOn 18 June 2020, The National Interest published a nine-thousand-word essay by Putin, titled \"The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II\".[296] In the essay, Putin criticizes the Western historical view of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as the start of World War II, stating that the Munich Agreement was the beginning.[297]\nOn 21 February 2023, Putin suspended Russia's participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.[298] On 25 March, President Putin announced the stationing of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Russia would maintain control of the weapons. President Putin told Russian TV: \"There is nothing unusual here either. Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades. They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries\".[299]\n-\nPutin with Pope John Paul II on 5 June 2000\n-\nPutin with Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and U.S. president George W.

In 2007, the crisis in relations continued with the expulsion of four Russian envoys over Russia's refusal to extradite former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi to face charges in the murder.[301] Mirroring the British actions, Russia expelled UK diplomats and took other retaliatory steps.[301]\nIn 2015, the British Governmen\nDoc 4(Title:  paid more than $67,000 by Russian companies before the 2016 presidential election.) - Jeff Sessions: Sessions, President Trump's Attorney General, had two conversations with Ambassador Kislyak during the 2016 presidential election. However, during later confirmation hearings, he claimed that he \"did not have communications with the Russians\" when prompted by Senator Al Franken. Once reports of his meetings with Kislyak surfaced, Sessions recused himself from any investigation into Russia's interference in our 2016 presidential election. Many officials are continuing to call for his resignation.\n- Rex Tillerson: Tillerson, President Trump's former Secretary of State, worked on energy projects in Russia for two decades during his career at Exxon. He has publicly described his \"very close relationship\" with President Putin and was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013, the highest state honor possible for a foreigner.\n- Jared Kushner: Kushner is President Trump's son-in-law and current Senior Advisor. Along with Michael Flynn, Kushner met with Ambassador Kislyak during the Presidential transition. The White House later acknowledged that following that meeting, Ambassador Kislyak requested a second meeting, which Kushner had a deputy attend. However, at Kislyak's request, Kushner did later meet with Sergey Gorkov, the head of Russia's state-owned development bank, who has close ties to President Putin. The U.S. placed this bank on its sanctions list following Russia's annexation of Crimea. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to question Kushner about his meetings with Russian officials. The New York Times recently reported that Kusher failed to disclose dozens of contacts with foreign leaders on his application for top-secret security clearance -- one of those contacts being Ambassador Kislyak.\n- Donald Trump, Jr.: Trump, Jr., President Trump's son, met with Fabien Baussart, a leader of a Syrian opposition group backed by the Russian government, and others about how the U.S. could work with Russia on the Syrian conflict weeks before Donald Trump was elected President. He has also been quoted saying that his father's businesses \"see a lot of money pouring in from Russia\", and that he had visited Russia on business over a half-dozen times. In June 2016, he met with a Russian billionaire, Emin Agalarov, under the premise that Emin had \"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia\" from the Crown prosecutor of Russia, and that this was part of \"Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n- Paul Manafort: Manafort, who has business connections to Russia and Ukraine, was hired as Trump's campaign manager in March 2016. He then resigned in August of the same year, after reports surfaced that suggested he had received $12.7 million from Victor Yanukovych, Ukraine's pro-Russia former president. It was recently revealed by AP that Manafort proposed in a strategy plan from as early as June 2005 that he would work to influence politics, business deals, and media inside the U.S. and Europe to benefit Putin. This plan was pitched to Oleg Deripaska, a \"Russian aluminum magnate\" with close ties to Putin. Manafort eventually signed a $10 million contract with Deripaska in early 2006. The Trump Administration and Manafort have both said that Manafort never worked for Russian interests. Since the FBI confirmed in a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 20 that investigators are examining whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, the White House has made attempts to distance itself from Manafort, claiming that he played \"a very limited role\" in the campaign, despite his clear leadership role as campaign chairman leading up to the Republican National Convention. On October 27, 2017, Manafort was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy against the United States, among other charges.\n- Ca\nDoc 5(Title: have a grudge against Hillary Clinton\".

However, the actual preference for Trump was more about weakening Clinton rather than supporting Trump. \n\nSince Trump's presidency, Russia's stance has been mixed. While Putin congratulated Trump on his victory and there was a brief period where Putin's favorability in the U.S. increased, relations have deteriorated again, particularly after Trump took office. Putin has accused Hillary Clinton of interfering in Russia's internal affairs, and there have been multiple instances of tension, such as the suspension of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty and the announcement of stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\n\nOverall, Russia seems to have preferred Trump because of the potential for less stringent foreign policy and a more favorable attitude towards Russia.

    "question": "Did Jesus Christ actually exist?",
    "agent_answer": "From the historical documents and scholarly analyses provided, there is considerable evidence supporting the existence of Jesus Christ. Multiple sources, both Christian and non-Christian, from various historical periods, mention Jesus or events related to his life. These include the New Testament, early Christian writings, and references in non-Christian texts such as those by Tacitus, Josephus, and Pliny the Younger.\n\nGiven the extensive and diverse nature of these references, it is generally accepted among scholars, regardless of their religious beliefs, that Jesus Christ did exist. The challenge lies more in understanding the exact nature and details of his life and teachings, rather than in confirming his existence.\n\n<answer>Yes, Jesus Christ did exist.</answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>Historical evidence for the existence of Jesus Christ is quite extensive. There are multiple sources including the New Testament, early Christian writings, and references in non-Christian texts from the time period.</think>\n\n<search>historical evidence for jesus christ existence</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Answer) Typically, when this question is asked, the person asking qualifies the question by asking for evidence âoutside of the Bible.â We do not grant this idea that the Bible cannot be considered a source of evidence for the existence of Jesus. The New Testament contains hundreds of references to Jesus Christ. There are those who date the writing of the Gospels to the second century A.D., more than 100 years after Jesusâ death. Even if this were the case (which we strongly dispute), in terms of ancient evidences, writings less than 200 years after events took place are considered very reliable evidences. Further, the vast majority of scholars (Christian and non-Christian) will grant that the Epistles of Paul (at least some of them) were in fact written by Paul in the middle of the first century A.D., less than 40 years after Jesusâ death. In terms of ancient manuscript evidence, this is extraordinarily strong proof of the existence of a man named Jesus in Israel in the early first century A.D.\nIt is also important to recognize that in A.D. 70, the Romans invaded and destroyed Jerusalem and most of Israel, slaughtering its inhabitants. Entire cities were literally burned to the ground. We should not be surprised, then, if much evidence of Jesusâ existence was destroyed. Many of the eyewitnesses of Jesus would have been killed. These facts likely limited the amount of surviving eyewitness testimony of Jesus.\nConsidering that Jesusâ ministry was largely confined to a relatively unimportant area in a small corner of the Roman Empire, a surprising amount of information about Jesus can be drawn from secular historical sources. Some of the more important historical evidences of Jesus include the following:\nThe first-century Roman Tacitus, who is considered one of the more accurate historians of the ancient world, mentioned superstitious âChristiansâ (from Christus, which is Latin for Christ), who suffered under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius. Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote that there was a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century (Annals 15.44).\nFlavius Josephus is the most famous Jewish historian. In his Antiquities he refers to James, âthe brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.â There is a controversial verse (18:3) that says, âNow there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man. For he was one who wrought surprising feats....He was [the] Christ...he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him.â One version reads, âAt this time there was a wise man named Jesus. His conduct was good and [he] was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. But those who became his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive; accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah, concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.â\nJulius Africanus quotes the historian Thallus in a discussion of the darkness that followed the crucifixion of Christ (Extant Writings, 18).\nPliny the Younger, in Letters 10:96, recorded early Christian worship practices including the fact that Christians worshiped Jesus as God and were very ethical, and he includes a reference to the love feast and Lordâs Supper.\nThe Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a) confirms Jesusâ crucifixion on the eve of Passover and the accusations against Christ of practicing sorcery and encouraging Jewish apostasy.\nLucian of Samosata was a second-century Greek writer who admits that Jesus was worshiped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them. He said that Jesusâ teachings included the brotherhood of believers, the importance of conversion, and the importance of denying other gods. Christians live\nDoc 2(Title: ter the time, that Jesus is supposed to have lived:) According to Remsburg, “Enough of the writings of the authors named in the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish author, and two disputed passages in the works of Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.” Nor, we may add, do any of these authors make note of the Disciples or Apostles – increasing the embarrassment from the silence of history concerning the foundation of Christianity.\nNotes\n- It is sometimes claimed that the “miraculous” spread of Christianity in the early Roman Empire is evidence of an historical Jesus – that such a movement could not have gone so far so fast had there not been a real person at its inception. A similar argument could be made, however, in the case of the earlier rapid spread of Mithraism. I am unaware of any Christian apologists who would argue that this supports the idea of an historical Mithra!\n- A profusely annotated paperback edition of Paine’s book is available from American Atheist Press for twelve dollars. (Order No. 5575, click here) [back]\n- An apocalypse is a pseudonymous piece of writing characterized by exaggerated symbolic imagery, usually dealing with the expectation of an imminent cosmic cataclysm wherein the deity destroys the wicked and rewards the righteous. Apocalyptic writing abounds in hidden meanings and numerological puzzles. Parts of a number of Judæo-Christian apocalypses other than Revelation have been preserved, but only the latter (if one does not consider the Book of Daniel to be entirely apocalyptic) was accepted into the Christian canon – and it almost didn’t make it, having been rejected by several early Church Fathers and Church Councils.\n- The opposite theory, often referred to as “Griesbach’s hypothesis,” that the author of Mark had “epitomized” the two longer gospels, keeping only the “essential” details, is today almost entirely rejected by bible scholars. While the arguments to support this nearly universal rejection are too involved to even summarize here, it may be noted that shortening of miracle stories is completely out of keeping with the principles of religious development seen everywhere today. Stories invariably get “better” (i.e., longer) with the retelling, never shorter!\n- There is compelling evidence indicating that these alleged sayings of Jesus were taken from another early document known as Q (German, for Quelle, ‘source’). Like the so-called Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi in Egypt, Q appears to have been a list of wisdom sayings that at some point became attributed to Jesus. We know that at least one of these sayings (“We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced…” Matt. 17:11; Luke 7:32) derives from Æsop’s Fables, not from a sage of Galilee!\n- I say “official gospels” because there are, in fact, many other gospels known. Once people started making them up, they sort of got stuck in over-drive. Only later on in Christian history did the number get pared back to four.\n- Even the letters supposed to contain authentic writings of Saul/Paul have been shown by a number of scholars to be as composite as the gospels (e.g., L. Gordon Rylands, A Critical Analysis of the Four Chief Pauline Epistles: Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and Galatians, Watts & Co., London, 1929). According to such analyses, the core Pauline material in these letters is what might be termed a pre-Christian Gnostic product. This material is surrounded by often contradictory material added by proto-Catholic interpolators and redactors who succeeded thus in claiming a popular proto-Gnostic authority for the Church of Rome. In any case, the Greek text of these letters is heavy with terms such as Archon, Æon, etc. – jargon terms popular in the more astrologically conscious forms of Gnosticism. It would appear that the Christ of Paul is as astral a being as the Lamb of Revelation. Lik\nDoc 3(Title: 'Did Jesus Exist?' A Historian Makes His Case) Did Jesus Exist?\nSo, did Jesus really exist? With his new book, Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth, Bart Ehrman, historian and professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, wanted to provide solid historical evidence for the existence of Jesus.\n\"I wanted to approach this question as an historian to see whether that's right or not,\" Ehrman tells weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz.\nThe answer is straightforward and widely accepted among scholars of all faiths, but Ehrman says there is a large contingent of people claiming that Jesus never did exist. These people are also known as mythicists.\n\"It was a surprise to me to see how influential these mythicists are,\" Ehrman says. \"Historically, they've been significant and in the Soviet Union, in fact, the mythicist view was the dominant view, and even today, in some parts of the West – in parts of Scandinavia — it is a dominant view that Jesus never existed,\" he says.\nMythicists' arguments are fairly plausible, Ehrman says. According to them, Jesus was never mentioned in any Roman sources and there is no archeological evidence that Jesus ever existed. Even Christian sources are problematic – the Gospels come long after Jesus' death, written by people who never saw the man.\n\"Most importantly,\" he explains, \"these mythicists point out that there are Pagan gods who were said to die and rise again and so the idea is that Jesus was made up as a Jewish god who died and rose again.\"\nIn his book, Ehrman marshals all of the evidence proving the existence of Jesus, including the writings of the apostle Paul.\n\"Paul knew Jesus' brother, James, and he knew his closest disciple, Peter, and he tells us that he did,\" Ehrman says. \"If Jesus didn't exist, you would think his brother would know about it, so I think Paul is probably pretty good evidence that Jesus at least existed,\" he says.\nIn Did Jesus Exist?, Ehrman builds a technical argument and shows that one of the reasons for knowing that Jesus existed is that if someone invented Jesus, they would not have created a messiah who was so easily overcome.\n\"The Messiah was supposed to overthrow the enemies – and so if you're going to make up a messiah, you'd make up a powerful messiah,\" he says. \"You wouldn't make up somebody who was humiliated, tortured and the killed by the enemies.\"\nSo Jesus did exist, but who was he? Ehrman says when historians focus on the life of Jesus, they discover a Jesus who is completely different from the one portrayed by popular culture or by religious texts.\n\"The mythicists have some right things to say,\" Ehrman says. \"The Gospels do portray Jesus in ways that are non-historical.\"\nWhen Raz asks Ehrman about his relationship to Jesus, Ehrman says that most of it is very historical but that Jesus teaches us valuable lessons.\n\"Jesus' teachings of love, and mercy and forgiveness, I think, really should dominate our lives,\" he says. \"On the personal level, I agree with many of the ethical teachings of Jesus and I try to model my life on them, even though I don't agree with the apocalyptic framework in which they were put.\"\nDoc 4(Title: nly ancient cults. (The Historical Evidence for Jesus; p.16).) There are further problems with the Tacitus story. Tacitus himself never again alludes to the Neronian persecution of Christians in any of his voluminous writings, and no other Pagan authors know anything of the outrage either. Most significant, however, is that ancient Christian apologists made no use of the story in their propaganda – an unthinkable omission by motivated partisans who were well-read in the works of Tacitus. Clement of Alexandria, who made a profession of collecting just such types of quotations, is ignorant of any Neronian persecution, and even Tertullian, who quotes a great deal from Tacitus, knows nothing of the story. According to Robert Taylor, the author of another freethought classic, the Diegesis (1834), the passage was not known before the fifteenth century, when Tacitus was first published at Venice by Johannes de Spire. Taylor believed de Spire himself to have been the forger.\nSo much for the evidence purporting to prove that Jesus was an historical figure. We have not, of course, proved that Jesus did not exist. We have only showed that all evidence alleged to support such a claim is without substance. But of course, that is all we need to show. The burden of proof is always on the one who claims that something exists or that something once happened. We have no obligation to try to prove a universal negative.Note J\nIt will be argued by die-hard believers that all my arguments “from silence” prove nothing and they will quote the aphorism, “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” But is the negative evidence I have referred to the same as absence of evidence? It might be instructive to consider how a hypothetical but similar problem might be dealt with in the physical sciences.\nImagine that someone has claimed that the USA had carried out atomic weapons tests on a particular Caribbean island in 1943. Would the lack of reports of mushroom-cloud sightings at the time be evidence of absence, or absence of evidence? (Remember, the Caribbean during the war years was under intense surveillance by many different factions.) Would it be necessary to go to the island today to scan its surface for the radioactive contamination that would have to be there if nuclear explosions had taken place there? If indeed, we went there with our Geiger-counters and found no trace of radioactive contamination, would that be evidence of absence, or absence of evidence? In this case, what superficially looks like absence of evidence is really negative evidence, and thus legitimately could be construed as evidence of absence. Can the negative evidence adduced above concerning Jesus be very much less compelling?\nIt would be intellectually satisfying to learn just how it was that the Jesus character condensed out of the religious atmosphere of the first century. But scholars are at work on the problem. The publication of many examples of so-called wisdom literature, along with the materials from the Essene community at Qumran by the Dead Sea and the Gnostic literature from the Nag Hammadi library in Egypt, has given us a much more detailed picture of the communal psychopathologies which infested the Eastern Mediterranean world at the turn of the era. It is not unrealistic to expect that we will be able, before long, to reconstruct in reasonable detail the stages by which Jesus came to have a biography.\nThey Should Have Noticed\nJohn E. Remsburg, in his classic book The Christ: A Critical Review and Analysis of the Evidence of His Existence (The Truth Seeker Company, NY, no date, pp. 24-25), lists the following writers who lived during the time, or within a century after the time, that Jesus is supposed to have lived:\nAccording to Remsburg, “Enough of the writings of the authors named in the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish author, and two disputed p\nDoc 5(Title: l says that “not I but the Lord, [say] that the wife should not separate from the husband.” That is, a wife should not seek divorce. If Jesus had actually said what Saul implies, and what Mark 10:12 claims he said, his audience would have thought he was nuts – as the Bhagwan says – or perhaps had suffered a blow to the head. So much for the testimony of Saul. His Jesus is nothing more than the thinnest hearsay, a legendary creature which was crucified as a sacrifice, a creature almost totally lacking a biography.) Extrabiblical “Evidence”\nSo far we have examined all the biblical evidences alleged to prove the existence of Jesus as an historical figure. We have found that they have no legitimacy as evidence. Now we must examine the last line of would-be evidence, the notion that Jewish and pagan historians recorded his existence.\nJewish Sources\nIt is sometimes claimed that Jewish writings hostile to Christianity prove that the ancient Jews knew of Jesus and that such writings prove the historicity of the man Jesus. But in fact, Jewish writings prove no such thing, as L. Gordon Rylands’ book Did Jesus Ever Live? pointed out nearly seventy years ago:\n…all the knowledge which the Rabbis had of Jesus was obtained by them from the Gospels. Seeing that Jews, even in the present more critical age, take it for granted that the figure of a real man stands behind the Gospel narrative, one need not be surprised if, in the second century, Jews did not think of questioning that assumption. It is certain, however, that some did question it. For Justin, in his Dialogue with Trypho, represents the Jew Trypho as saying, “ye follow an empty rumour and make a Christ for yourselves.” “If he was born and lived somewhere he is entirely unknown.”\nThat the writers of the Talmud [4th-5th centuries CE, FRZ] had no independent knowledge of Jesus is proved by the fact that they confounded him with two different men neither of whom can have been he. Evidently no other Jesus with whom they could identify the Gospel Jesus was known to them. One of these, Jesus ben Pandira, reputed a wonder-worker, is said to have been stoned to death and then hung on a tree on the eve of a Passover in the reign of Alexander Jannæus (106-79 BC) at Jerusalem. The other, Jesus ben Stada, whose date is uncertain, but who may have lived in the first third of the second century CE, is also said to have been stoned and hanged on the eve of a Passover, but at Lydda. There may be some confusion here; but it is plain that the Rabbis had no knowledge of Jesus apart from what they had read in the Gospels.Citation 11\nAlthough Christian apologists have listed a number of ancient historians who allegedly were witnesses to the existence of Jesus, the only two that consistently are cited are Josephus, a Pharisee, and Tacitus, a pagan. Since Josephus was born in the year 37 CE, and Tacitus was born in 55, neither could have been an eye-witness of Jesus, who supposedly was crucified in 30 CE. So we could really end our article here. But someone might claim that these historians nevertheless had access to reliable sources, now lost, which recorded the existence and execution of our friend JC. So it is desirable that we take a look at these two supposed witnesses.\nIn the case of Josephus, whose Antiquities of the Jews was written in 93 CE, about the same time as the gospels, we find him saying some things quite impossible for a good Pharisee to have said:\nAbout this time, there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who wrought surprising feats and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Messiah. When Pilate, upon hearing him accused by men of the highest standing amongst us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who had in the first place come to love him did not give up their affection for him.

Multiple sources, both Christian and non-Christian, from various historical periods, mention Jesus or events related to his life. These include the New Testament, early Christian writings, and references in non-Christian texts such as those by Tacitus, Josephus, and Pliny the Younger.\n\nGiven the extensive and diverse nature of these references, it is generally accepted among scholars, regardless of their religious beliefs, that Jesus Christ did exist.

    "question": "Should illegal immigrants be treated as criminals?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information gathered, the treatment of illegal immigrants as criminals is often disproportionate and lacks proportionality to the actual crimes committed. Many of the crimes that lead to deportation are minor infractions such as traffic offenses, and the enforcement tends to be harsher for immigrants than for native-born citizens. There is also a significant overlap between immigration enforcement and the \"war on terror,\" leading to racial profiling and the targeting of immigrants in the name of national security, which can be unjustified. On the other hand, immigrants are generally less likely to commit crimes compared to the native-born population, and they contribute positively to society in various ways. Therefore, treating all illegal immigrants as criminals is not a balanced approach. A more nuanced and humane policy is needed that considers the individual circumstances and the overall impact on society. </think>\n\n<answer> No </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> The question involves ethical and legal considerations. Illegal immigration is often treated as a civil matter rather than a criminal one in many countries, although there can be exceptions for those who commit crimes alongside their illegal entry or stay.\n\nHowever, treating all illegal immigrants as criminals might not align with the principles of humanitarianism and the rule of law. It could also lead to human rights abuses and ineffective enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nOn the other hand, failing to treat them as criminals might encourage more illegal immigration and strain resources for law enforcement and social services.</think>\n\n<search> how illegal immigration is legally treated </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: olicy has been applied by the federal government to immigrants who commit even the slightest offense or infraction. “Crimes” which might result in a fine or a suspended sentence for natives end up getting immigrants detained and deported. This represents a double standard of justice for immigrants in which the scale of the punishment (detention and deportation) far outweighs the severity of the crime (traffic offenses, for example). Unfortunately, this double standard has been the guiding principle behind a litany of immigration-enforcement laws and programs, such as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), the 287(g) program, Secure Communities, and the “Consequence Delivery System” implemented by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in 2011.) The evidence that immigrants tend not to be criminals is overwhelming. To begin with, there is an inverse relationship between crime and immigration. Crime rates in the United States have trended downward for many years at the same time that the number of immigrants has grown. Second, immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than the native-born. And, third, immigrants are less likely than the native-born to engage in the criminal behaviors that tend to land one in prison. No matter how you look at the issue, the inescapable conclusion is that immigrants are, on average, less prone to criminality than the U.S. native-born population.\nHigher Immigration is Associated with Lower Crime Rates\nAs the number of immigrants in the United States has risen in recent years, crime rates have fallen. Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population grew from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent {Figure 1} and the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled from 3.5 million to 11.2 million {Figure 2}. During the same period, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48 percent—which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder {Figure 3}. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41 percent, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary {Figure 4}. This decline in crime rates in the face of high levels of new immigration has been a steady national trend, and has occurred in cities across the country.\nThe most thoroughly studied aspect of this phenomenon has been the drop in rates of violent crime since the early 1990s in cities that have long been “gateways” for immigrants entering the United States, such as Miami, Chicago, El Paso, San Antonio, and San Diego. However, the inverse relationship between immigration and crime is also apparent in “new” immigrant gateways, such as Austin, where rates of both violent crime and serious property crime have declined despite high levels of new immigration. Declining rates of property crime have also been documented in metropolitan areas across the country. Some scholars suggest that new immigrants may revitalize dilapidated urban areas, ultimately reducing violent crime rates.\nIn short, to quote sociologist Robert J. Sampson, “cities of concentrated immigration are some of the safest places around.” The reason for this is straightforward. Immigrants as a group tend to be highly motivated, goal-driven individuals who have little to gain by running afoul of the law. As law professor and public-policy expert Michael Tonry puts it: “First-generation economic immigrants are self-selected risk takers who leave their homes, families, and languages to move to a new country to improve their and their children’s lives. They have good reasons to work hard, defer gratifications, and stay out of trouble.” Sampson and colleagues also find that immigrant communities are insulated from crime because they tend to display “social cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good.”\nThere is a sense of déjà vu in these modern-day findings. In the first three decades of the 20th century, during t\nDoc 2(Title: t supporting documents.) Because these services are illegal, the criminals have tremendous power, while the migrants are left vulnerable. Many migrants are abused or die on the way to their destination, and many are abandoned en route without resources. Refugees and asylum seekers, as well as vulnerable migrants such as unaccompanied minors and pregnant women, can be among those who pay a high price for smuggling services with no guarantee for their safety or the success of the venture.\nIn many cases, migrants are mistreated during the smuggling process and the conditions that they are made to endure are severe. When they realize the situation they are in, some migrants try and turn back, but they are inevitably forced to continue with the journey.\nThere are many different ways of smuggling migrants; they range from simple to complex, from safe to dangerous and from cheap to very costly. The level of safety and ease of reaching the destination are dependent on the amount of money paid. Migrants with little financial means may opt for a \"pay-as-you-go\" package in which they pay bit by bit for different parts of the journey to smugglers who may not be linked with one another. These migrants are more likely to become stranded and be exposed to abuse. The more comprehensive \"package deals\" may be quicker, safer and have a higher guarantee of success, but they can also be considerably more expensive.\nSmuggling routes can be affected by long detours and last-minute changes in the itinerary to take advantage of certain border policies or weaknesses in border control. The routes may originate and end on the same continent, be transcontinental or involve transiting through a third continent. Two examples of routes commonly used for the smuggling of migrants are the route leading from South America and Central America (as well as Mexico) to North America and the route leading from Africa to Europe.\nFrom South America and Central America to North America\nIt is estimated that just under one third of all immigrants in the United States of America are there illegally, with about 80 per cent of the illegal immigrant population in the country originating in South America (as well as Mexico). Of all illegal immigrants in the United States, an estimated 25-40 per cent entered the country on a legal visa and then overstayed, and the remainder entered the country clandestinely. Of the latter group, 97 per cent entered the United States clandestinely through that country's border with Mexico; coastal apprehensions comprised less than 1 per cent of the total. [2] While not all illegal immigrants are smuggled, these figures do provide an indication of the extent of the situation.\nMost migrants are smuggled across the border in trucks, although there have been cases in which the crossing is made on foot, by rail or even through special tunnels. The organized criminal groups involved in smuggling migrants across the border between Mexico and the United States appear to be based largely in Mexico and Central America. For the smugglers, there appears to be little risk of arrest, as they normally pretend to be irregular migrants themselves and are repatriated rather than apprehended.\nWhile the percentage of migrants who have been smuggled is unknown, it is estimated that Latin Americans account for around 3 million illegal entries into the United States each year, generating an annual income of about $6.6 billion for criminals. [3] Incidents of hostage-taking and extortion have increasingly been noted, which highlights the diverse criminal elements involved in the smuggling of migrants.\nFigures for 2008 show that 88 per cent of migrants apprehended at United States borders were Mexican nationals, 3 per cent were from Honduras, 3 per cent were from Guatemala, 2 per cent were from El Salvador and 4 per cent were from other countries. The fees charged for smuggling migrants differ substantially depending on the point of origin. Migrants smuggled across the b\nDoc 3(Title: Who is an American? Traditionally, we look to citizenship to answer that question, but the issue is more complicated than legal labels. Even President Trump seems to recognize this in his periodic openness to negotiating comprehensive immigration reform.) Among the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States today, 60 percent have lived here for a decade or more. Many have built deep family and community ties, through U.S.-citizen spouses, children, jobs, homes and mortgages. They have become Americans in all but legal status.\nCurrent law rarely grants long-term immigrants the right to stay, sentencing them to a life of uncertainty without parole. Any unlucky traffic stop or encounter with law-enforcement officials can lead to deportation with no right of return. Such a punishment is in many ways worse than a prison sentence, which at least gives people who break the law a chance to return to their former life.\nThey don’t under criminal law. Except for the most heinous crimes, statutes of limitation require the government either to prosecute an offender within a certain period — five years for most federal crimes — or to drop the matter. Civil suits, such as for tort or breach of contract, must similarly be brought within a fixed period. We ordinarily do not countenance holding people accountable for misdeeds committed a decade or more ago, in part out of recognition that people should be able to move on with their lives despite what they have done in the past.\nIf we accept a time limit for holding even criminals accountable, why not for deporting immigrants? At some point, a person who entered the United States without authorization but has put down real roots in the country should be eligible for a path to legal status.\nWould ending this uncertainty after a specified period mean rewarding people for breaking the law? No, it would mean recognizing that enforcing the law is not the only interest at stake and that long-term residents also have legitimate interests in sustaining the lives they have built. That would not necessarily mean granting citizenship but would require at least a reasonable path to legal status.\nNot everyone would qualify. Congress would have to determine how long an immigrant must have lived in the United States to be eligible. Some people who have committed serious crimes could be presumptively excluded, although we should avoid the tendency of current law to treat petty crime as grounds for deportation.\nGranting legal status to long-term immigrants would also improve the lives of many U.S. citizens, especially the spouses and children of those who came to the United States illegally. We owe some respect to these families before deporting a mother or husband. Moreover, like any of us, immigrants witness crimes. They are likely to step forward to provide testimony only if they are safe from deportation. Entire sectors of the economy — such as agriculture, construction, landscape and domestic work — depend on immigrants who are willing to do jobs that ordinary Americans will not. And legal status would make people less vulnerable to economic exploitation, reducing downward pressure on wages.\nToday, the Trump administration’s deportation machine extends well beyond the nearly 700,000“dreamers” — the people brought to the United States as children but who now face a future of uncertainty. It also includes hundreds of thousands of people who have lived in the United States under protected status for well over a decade but who are now being ordered back to their home countries. These immigrants have built lives in America and now could see their futures crushed in a heartbeat.\nDoc 4(Title: n population in search of anyone who might be deportable. With the technologically sophisticated enforcement systems in place today, being stopped by a police officer for driving a car with a broken tail light can culminate in a one-way trip out of the country if the driver long ago pled guilty to a misdemeanor that has since been defined as a deportable offense.) Misleading Language in the “Official” Deportation Statistics\nThe definition of “criminal alien” used by the federal government is clearly inconsistent with the general public’s understanding of serious crime. The term represents a terminological sleight-of-hand used to justify a punitive approach to immigration enforcement that is based on incarceration and deportation. An important part of the government’s attempt to redefine what it means to be a “criminal alien,” with all the social and legal implications this label carries, becomes clear upon closer consideration of the data on enforcement actions that is released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). According to DHS, 438,421 foreign nationals were removed from the United States in FY 2013. Among those removed, roughly 45 percent (198,394) were classified as “known criminal aliens.” (Along these lines, the director of ICE testified before Congress that “eighty-five percent of individuals removed or returned from the interior were previously convicted of a criminal offense”).\nHowever, a more detailed examination of the data clearly illustrates that the majority of “criminal aliens” are in factnot being removed for what most Americans perceive to be serious crime, such as the FBI’s eight Index Crimes, which consist of “Part I” offenses (homicide, assault, forcible rape, and robbery) and “Part II” offenses (larceny, burglary, motor vehicle theft and arson). In fact, DHS’s FY 2013 enforcement actions indicate that serious crimes such as “Assault,” “Robbery,” “Burglary,” and “Sexual Assault” collectively make up only one-fifth of the crime categories for which “criminal aliens” were removed. Nearly one-third (31.3 percent) of “criminal aliens” were removed for “Immigration” offenses (i.e., illegal entry or reentry into the United States), followed by 15.4 percent for “Dangerous Drugs” (which includes possession of marijuana), and 15 percent for “Criminal Traffic Offenses” (including both Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and “hit and run”). Also noteworthy are an additional 14.2 percent of “criminal aliens” who were removed for “All other categories, including unknown” {Figure 7}.\nImmigrant Incarceration and the Rise of the Private Prison Industry\nThe criminalization of immigration involves much more than the manipulation of official deportation statistics. It is also driven by a massive expansion in the infrastructure for the detention of immigrants who fit one or more of the growing list of offenses that qualify as “criminal” for immigration purposes. The immigrant-detention industry began to expand in earnest during the early 1980s following the creation of the Krome Avenue Detention Center in Miami to detain Mariel refugees from Cuba. Moreover, at the same time the immigration detention system has grown, the nation’s prison system has become increasingly privatized. The end result is the federal government’s reliance upon private prison corporations, such as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group, to handle the burgeoning inflows of “criminal aliens.”\nAs the immigrant-detention industry grew, so did the redefinition of “immigrants” as an inherently dangerous group of people. This can be attributed in part to the fact that private prison companies work actively to shape the federal and state laws governing corrections and law-enforcement. The companies make sizeable campaign contributions to politicians, and lobby Congress and state legislatures on bills that affect their interests. These companies also belong to organizations such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)\nDoc 5(Title: geted Arabs, Muslims, and South Asians in the aftermath of 9/11, the “war on terror” has had an impact on all immigrants regardless of ethnicity or legal status—including Latin American immigrants, particularly Mexicans, who comprise the majority of immigration detainees. Post-9/11 policies not only increased funding for various immigration-enforcement functions as part of the broader effort to enhance national security, but fostered an “us or them” mentality in which “they” are the foreign-born.) More precisely, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 collectively “illustrate the accelerating criminalization of the immigration system.” This intersection of criminal and immigration law has led to a notable increase in deportations. As Stumpf notes, in the period “between 1908 and 1980, there were approximately 56,000 immigrants deported based on criminal convictions. In 2004 alone, there were more than 88,000 such deportations.” While immigration law had been used by U.S. authorities to remove non-citizens who came into contact with the criminal justice system in the pre-9/11 era, the relationship between these two systems of law intensified after 9/11. As law professor Teresa A. Miller notes, “After the attacks, zero-tolerance enforcement of immigration laws was extended to immigrants who had not passed through the criminal justice system, such as asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants.” The PATRIOT Act in particular allowed federal officers to apprehend and detain “non-citizens on immigration grounds without legal review and without public disclosure of the specific charge for a period of seven days, or for a maximum of six months if the case is deemed a national security risk.”\nThe “war on terror” thus had immediate implications for foreign-born individuals residing in the United States. As Miller states: “In January of 2002, Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson announced a new initiative to ‘locate, apprehend, interview, and deport’ approximately 314,000 noncitizens who had been ordered deported, but had failed to comply with their deportation orders.” This initiative led to the arrest of more than 1,100 Muslim and Arab men without formally charging them with a crime. However, the consequences of the PATRIOT Act extended beyond these individuals and into immigrant communities, ultimately being manifested through “racial profiling and scapegoating, mass detentions and mistreatment, and the government’s refusal to disclose information about those detained.”\nA prime example of the enforcement-only mindset of DHS and its component agencies in the post-9/11 era is “Operation Endgame”—the name given to the “Office of Detention and Removal Strategic Plan, 2003–2012,” which was released on June 27, 2003, by Anthony S. Tangeman, Director of ICE’s Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO). Tangeman succinctly explains the rationale underlying his department’s new strategic plan:\nAs the title implies, DRO provides the endgame to immigration enforcement and that is the removal of all removable aliens. This is also the essence of our mission statement and the ‘golden measure’ of our success. We must endeavor to maintain the integrity of the immigration process and protect our homeland by ensuring that every alien who is ordered removed, and can be, departs the United States as quickly as possible and as effectively as practicable. We must strive for 100% removal rate.\nHowever, Tangeman’s assertions about how best to “protect our homeland” ring hollow given that the vast majority of immigrants aren’t criminals (let alone terrorists), and that even minor infractions can render an immigrant “deportable” under current law. Yet the Tangeman memo, and the strategic plan it introduces, treat all immigrants as potential security ris\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information gathered, the treatment of illegal immigrants as criminals is often disproportionate and lacks proportionality to the actual crimes committed.

Some limitations to freedom of speech may occur through legal sanction, and others may occur through social disapprobation.[72] In Saudi Arabia, journalists are forbidden to write with disrespect or disapproval of the royal family, religion, or the government. Journalists are also not legally protected for their writing in Saudi Arabia. Journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a critic of the Saudi Arabian government. Saudi Arabian officials killed Khashoggi in 2018 for his writing.[73]\nTime, place, and manner\n[edit]Limitations based on time, place, and manner apply to all speech, regardless of the view expressed.[74] They are generally restrictions that are intended to balance other rights or a legitimate government interest. For example, a time, place, and manner restriction might prohibit a noisy political demonstration at a politician's home during the middle of the night, as that impinges upon the rights of the politician's neighbors to quiet enjoyment of their own homes. An otherwise identical activity might be permitted if it happened at a different time (e.g., during the day), at a different place (e.g., at a government building or in another public forum), or in a different manner (e.g., a silent protest). Funeral protests are a complex issue in the United States. It is a right for Americans to hold a peaceful protest against various policies they deem unreasonable. It is a question of whether or not it is appropriate to protest funeral proceedings through the time, place, and manner outlook. Because of recent flare-ups, legislation has been implemented to limit this. Now, funeral protests are governed and prohibited by law on a state-to-state basis inside the United States.\nContent viewed as harmful and offensive\n[edit]Some views are illegal to express because some perceive them to be harmful to others. This category often includes speech that is both false and potentially dangerous, such as falsely shouting \"Fire!\" in a theatre and causing a panic. Justifications for limitations to freedom of speech often reference the \"harm principle\" or the \"offence principle\".\nIn On Liberty (1859), John Stuart Mill argued that \"...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered\".[72] Mill argues that the fullest liberty of expression is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment.[75][76][77][78]\nIn 1985, Joel Feinberg introduced what is known as the \"offence principle\". Feinberg wrote, \"It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing serious offence (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end\".[79] Hence Feinberg argues that the harm principle sets the bar too high and that some forms of expression can be legitimately prohibited by law because they are very offensive. Nevertheless, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties should be higher for causing harm.[79] In contrast, Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.[72] Because the degree to which people may take offence varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that several factors need to be taken into account when applying the offence principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offence, and the general interest of the community at large.[72]\nJasper Doomen argued that harm should be defined from the point of view of the individual citizen, not limiting harm to physical h\nDoc 2(Title: er of controversy for defending the free speech rights of groups that spew hate, such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis.

If we do not come to the defense of the free speech rights of the most unpopular among us, even if their views are antithetical to the very freedom the First Amendment stands for, then no one's liberty will be secure. In that sense, all First Amendment rights are \"indivisible.\") Censoring so-called hate speech also runs counter to the long-term interests of the most frequent victims of hate: racial, ethnic, religious and sexual minorities. We should not give the government the power to decide which opinions are hateful, for history has taught us that government is more apt to use this power to prosecute minorities than to protect them. As one federal judge has put it, tolerating hateful speech is \"the best protection we have against any Nazi-type regime in this country.\"\nAt the same time, freedom of speech does not prevent punishing conduct that intimidates, harasses, or threatens another person, even if words are used. Threatening phone calls, for example, are not constitutionally protected.\nSPEECH & NATIONAL SECURITY\nThe Supreme Court has recognized the government's interest in keeping some information secret, such as wartime troop deployments. But the Court has never actually upheld an injunction against speech on national security grounds. Two lessons can be learned from this historical fact. First, the amount of speech that can be curtailed in the interest of national security is very limited. And second, the government has historically overused the concept of \"national security\" to shield itself from criticism, and to discourage public discussion of controversial policies or decisions.\nIn 1971, the publication of the \"Pentagon Papers\" by the New York Times brought the conflicting claims of free speech and national security to a head. The Pentagon Papers, a voluminous secret history and analysis of the country's involvement in Vietnam, was leaked to the press. When the Times ignored the government's demand that it cease publication, the stage was set for a Supreme Court decision. In the landmark U.S. v. New York Times case, the Court ruled that the government could not, through \"prior restraint,\" block publication of any material unless it could prove that it would \"surely\" result in \"direct, immediate, and irreparable\" harm to the nation. This the government failed to prove, and the public was given access to vital information about an issue of enormous importance.\nThe public's First Amendment \"right to know\" is essential to its ability to fully participate in democratic decision-making. As the Pentagon Papers case demonstrates, the government's claims of \"national security\" must always be closely scrutinized to make sure they are valid.\nUNPROTECTED EXPRESSION\nThe Supreme Court has recognized several limited exceptions to First Amendment protection.\n- In Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), the Court held that so-called \"fighting words ... which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,\" are not protected. This decision was based on the fact that fighting words are of \"slight social value as a step to truth.\"\n- In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), the Court held that defamatory falsehoods about public officials can be punished -- only if the offended official can prove the falsehoods were published with \"actual malice,\" i.e.: \"knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\" Other kinds of \"libelous statements\" are also punishable.\n- Legally \"obscene\" material has historically been excluded from First Amendment protection.

The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and international human rights law. Many countries have constitutional laws that protect freedom of speech. Terms such as free speech, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression are often used interchangeably in political discourse. However, in legal contexts, freedom of expression more broadly encompasses the right to seek, receive, and impart information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.\nArticle 19 of the UDHR states that \"everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference\" and \"everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice\". The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries \"special duties and responsibilities\" and may \"therefore be subject to certain restrictions\" when necessary \"[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others\" or \"[f]or the protection of national security or public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals\".[1]\nTherefore, freedom of speech and expression may not be recognized as absolute. Common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, hate speech, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, blasphemy and perjury. Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\".[2]\nThe \"offense principle\" is also used to justify speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.[2]\nWith the evolution of the digital age, new means of communication emerged. However, these means are also subject to new restrictions. Countries or organizations may use internet censorship to block undesirable or illegal material. Social media platforms frequently use content moderation to filter or remove user-generated content that is deemed against the terms of service, even if that content is not illegal.\nHistorical origins\n[edit]Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern international human rights instruments.[3] It is thought that the ancient Athenian democratic principle of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.[4]\nFreedom of speech was vindicated by Erasmus and Milton.[3] Edward Coke claimed freedom of speech as \"an ancient custom of Parliament\" in the 1590s, affirmed in the Protestation of 1621.[5] Restating what is written in the English Declaration of Right, 1689, England's Bill of Rights 1689 legally established the constitutional right of freedom of speech in Parliament, which is still in effect.[6][7] This so-called parliamentary privilege includes no possible defamation claims, meaning Parliamentarians are free to speak up in the House without fear of legal action.[8] This protection extends to written proceedings: for example, written and oral questions, motions and amendments tabled to bills and motions.[8] Taking refuge in England in 1726, Voltaire wrote about his admiration for the tolerance and freedom of speech in Englan\nDoc 5(Title: Number 10) FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION\nFreedom of speech, of the press, of association, of assembly and petition -- this set of guarantees, protected by the First Amendment, comprises what we refer to as freedom of expression. The Supreme Court has written that this freedom is \"the matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom.\" Without it, other fundamental rights, like the right to vote, would wither and die.\nBut in spite of its \"preferred position\" in our constitutional hierarchy, the nation's commitment to freedom of expression has been tested over and over again. Especially during times of national stress, like war abroad or social upheaval at home, people exercising their First Amendment rights have been censored, fined, even jailed. Those with unpopular political ideas have always borne the brunt of government repression. It was during WWI -- hardly ancient history -- that a person could be jailed just for giving out anti-war leaflets. Out of those early cases, modern First Amendment law evolved. Many struggles and many cases later, ours is the most speech-protective country in the world.\nThe path to freedom was long and arduous. It took nearly 200 years to establish firm constitutional limits on the government's power to punish \"seditious\" and \"subversive\" speech. Many people suffered along the way, such as labor leader Eugene V. Debs, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison under the Espionage Act just for telling a rally of peaceful workers to realize they were \"fit for something better than slavery and cannon fodder.\" Or Sidney Street, jailed in 1969 for burning an American flag on a Harlem street corner to protest the shooting of civil rights figure James Meredith. (see box)\nTHE FIRST AMENDMENT IGNORED\nEarly Americans enjoyed great freedom compared to citizens of other nations. Nevertheless, once in power, even the Constitution's framers were guilty of overstepping the First Amendment they had so recently adopted. In 1798, during the French-Indian War, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Act, which made it a crime for anyone to publish \"any false, scandalous and malicious writing\" against the government. It was used by the then-dominant Federalist Party to prosecute prominent Republican newspaper editors during the late 18th century.\nThroughout the 19th century, sedition, criminal anarchy and criminal conspiracy laws were used to suppress the speech of abolitionists, religious minorities, suffragists, labor organizers, and pacifists. In Virginia prior to the Civil War, for example, anyone who \"by speaking or writing maintains that owners have no right of property in slaves\" was subject to a one-year prison sentence.\nThe early 20th century was not much better. In 1912, feminist Margaret Sanger was arrested for giving a lecture on birth control. Trade union meetings were banned and courts routinely granted injunctions prohibiting strikes and other labor protests. Violators were sentenced to prison. Peaceful protesters opposing U. S. entry into World War I were jailed for expressing their opinions. In the early 1920s, many states outlawed the display of red or black flags, symbols of communism and anarchism. In 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the text of the First Amendment at a union rally. Many people were arrested merely for membership in groups regarded as \"radical\" by the government. It was in response to the excesses of this period that the ACLU was founded in 1920.\nFree speech rights still need constant, vigilant protection. New questions arise and old ones return. Should flag burning be a crime? What about government or private censorship of works of art that touch on sensitive issues like religion or sexuality? Should the Internet be subject to any form of government control? What about punishing college students who espouse racist or sexist opinions? In answering these questions, the history and the core values of the First Amendment should be our guide.\nTH\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that freedom of speech is a fundamental right but it is not absolute. It can be limited in certain circumstances, such as when speech causes harm, is libelous, slanderous, obscene, or violates the rights of others. However, these limitations are typically applied in a way that balances the protection of speech with the prevention of harm. The right to freedom of speech is crucial for a functional society as it allows for open debate, accountability, and the exchange of ideas. Thus, while there are legitimate reasons to restrict certain types of speech, the overall necessity of freedom of speech in a functional society remains strong.\n\n<answer> Yes, freedom of speech is a necessity in a functional society. </answer>",

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> The term \"queer\" is often used to describe people who do not conform to traditional gender roles or sexual norms. However, historical and biblical texts do not provide explicit details about Jesus's sexuality. To accurately address this question, I would need to look into scholarly interpretations and historical contexts.</think>\n<search> \"Was Jesus queer?\" scholarly interpretations </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Jesus has long been a figure representing wholesome celibacy in the Christian faith, but assuming he was a real person, the odds are that he had sexual desires like the rest of us. One way Jesus could have handled those urges is by participating in homosexual acts which were not too uncommon for men in the time and place that he lived. However, homosexuality in monotheistic faith has always been a point of contention, so this possibility is often overlooked. Until now.) What makes the case for a queer Jesus so interesting is the sexual climate he lived in. Ancient Greece is somewhat known for including homosexual acts, especially between men, as part of their culture. It wasn’t exactly the kind of all-encompassing queer culture we have today with marriage equality and whatnot. Instead, think Grindr personified. What made Ancient Greece so different was that there was no concept of sexuality at that time, but only of an active role (tops) and a passive role (bottoms). Not having a concept of sexuality excluded the possibility of romantic same-sex relationships but encouraged frequent, meaningless homosexual encounters (hookups). It was the custom that as long as men assumed the active role, they could preserve their masculinity and have sex with whoever they pleased. However, if a grown man assumed the passive role it was cause for great shame and embarrassment. This general attitude created a dynamic in Ancient Greece where wealthy men often had extramarital relations with male slaves, prostitutes (who were often free slaves), and most notably, boys ages 12 to 17. Not exactly the masc for masc fantasy that’s so common today, but you get the point.\nOf course, anyone who knows anything about the life of Jesus knows that he wasn’t in Ancient Greece but in Ancient Rome. Ancient Greece is important, however, because it provided a template for how the Romans treated sexuality. In other words, the Grindr of Greek culture got an app store update and rebranded itself as Rome. This made two men having intercourse in Rome so common that when the act occasionally found its way into theater it required no explanation nor would it even be the source of controversy. I can see it now, Romos: The Musical. Jokes aside, one thing that culturally distinguished Rome was that Rome focused more on the dichotomy between citizens and noncitizens. So, while a typical homosexual encounter in Greece would involve something like a master and apprentice, Roman homosexuality almost exclusively involved a slave, non-citizen, or member of a marginalized group like the Jews. Yes, this means that if anything, Jesus was probably a bottom.\nIn addition to his status as a Jew in a Roman society, Jesus’ reputation would have given him an even greater likelihood of being accused of participating in homosexual acts. Around Jesus’ lifetime, there was a shift in the dominant culture of Rome to ostracize men that threatened the status quo. The types of men affected were typically kind and effeminate, and religiously or politically deviant. Once targeted, these men would be pointed out as those who prefer the passive role and the stigma attached to that label made their lives hell. Essentially, a form of ancient homophobia in which troublesome men would be rumored as bottoms and the world would consequently shun them. While there’s no evidence that indicates Jesus was particularly effeminate, he was surely kind, and both politically and religiously deviant enough to get crucified. Since he fit the profile so well, there is actually a strong likelihood that leading up to his death, Jesus garnered a dangerous reputation in Rome for being the type of man that would submit to playing the passive role. Furthermore, this reputation would have given his followers a strong reason to deny his sexuality in order to preserve his image– regardless of the truth of the matter. A solemn reminder that sometimes there’s no safer place than the closet.\nAt this point, it seems fair to ask ju\nDoc 2(Title: ations about the separation of what is “human” from what is “Divine.” With his physical body in heaven and his earthly body as the Church, he opens new possibilities for our human bodies to participate in the life of Christ through ritual and community. We are promised that Jesus will return the same way he left: in community, subverting our societal obsession with individualism and personal accomplishment. While Jesus takes his physical leave from his friends, he promises to be with them always through the Spirit of God, opening new possibilities for fluidity in relationship.) In the Ascension, Jesus queers what it means to be present with, for, and among each other. He queers our understanding of bodies, physicality, and permanence. He queers the distinctions we try to make between the many forms and faces of God in our world. He queers the boundaries that we have constructed between heaven and earth.\nIn doing all this, Jesus invites us into the queer rhythms of Divine accompaniment, the queer mystery of Divine embodiment, and the queer practice of life in the Trinity. May we accept this invitation to follow the queer way of Jesus. May we always bear witness to his life and love as our full trans-itioning and trans-forming selves. And may we feel the presence of God within us and around us, in our humanity and our spark of divinity, until the end of the age.\n—Allison Connelly-Vetter (she/her), May 21, 2023\nDoc 3(Title: g the passive role. Furthermore, this reputation would have given his followers a strong reason to deny his sexuality in order to preserve his image– regardless of the truth of the matter. A solemn reminder that sometimes there’s no safer place than the closet.) At this point, it seems fair to ask just how likely it was that Jesus would take a partner of any gender. Biblically and historically there isn’t any evidence pointing strongly either way, and the prevailing two theories among Christians are a somewhat unfounded claim for his celibacy and an argument for his relationship with Mary Magdalene. However, I could just as easily write a gay fanfic about Jesus and John the Apostle that has the same level of merit, so reading into those claims would be ill-advised. All we really know is that it was extremely common for first-century rabbis to have multiple partners throughout their lives and eventually marry, and that Jesus surely faced social pressure to fit this norm. Even if he were to succumb to that pressure though, who’s to say whether that relationship would have been Jim and Pam from The Office or just a second beard for when the one on his face wasn’t enough.\nUnfortunately, despite living in a society that was more accepting than many other ancient cultures, the odds are in favor of Jesus having never performed a homosexual act. There exists neither historical nor biblical evidence to suggest that Jesus was interested in anything sexual, homo or otherwise. Analyzing Roman culture just tells us more about the world Jesus lived in rather than participated in since even the historical Jesus surely lived a unique life. The same goes for analyzing the typical first-century Jewish man. That being said, the fact that there is little conclusive evidence he ever took a partner only strengthens the likelihood that if he did actually have sex that it was with a man. Anything he did with a woman would have been seen as much more substantial, and consequently recorded. However, it’s entirely possible that he could have had casual sex with a man and nobody even thought it important enough to mention, or better yet, they thought it important enough to hide.\nThere are a few further implications from this that I think are really important to note. First and foremost, I can say with certainty that Jesus knew about and interacted with queerness many times in the course of his life. Given his reputation, it seems the only plausible reaction Jesus would have had to interacting with queers was to be kind, accepting, and offer forgiveness. In fact, it’s likely that Jesus himself was labeled as a queer, and that label became an important part of his life and experience on earth. In today’s world where queerness and faith often find themselves at odds, it’s important to remind ourselves that moral figures like Jesus exist not to make us question ourselves or others, but to set an example of the type of unconditional kindness we should lead our lives with.\nDoc 4(Title: ne. But it is also iconic of the queerness of God. The Trinity affirms a God who is [checks notes] both essentially three and essentially one. I cannot begin to imagine anything stranger or queerer than that. It’s an outrage to simple, populist thinking. The doctrine sits there in the architecture of Christian imaginations, and we barely begin to appreciate the Escher-like queerness of it all.) Althaus-Reid talks about how so many traditional ways of talking about God “closet the divine.” The church wants to force God’s abundant and life-transforming outrageousness into hiding. As a Latinx Catholic growing up in Argentina, Althaus-Reid witnessed the garish campiness of festivals in which statues of the Blessed Virgin, the Queen of Heaven, were processed through streets. Yet for all her sense that this was something that held the possibility of queering our imaginations, she came to see that the authorized church version of the Mother of God was sanitized: Mary was presented as a rich white woman who never walked. The divine image was made bland, and the unruly facts of actual cis and trans women’s lives were erased.\nOne need not be a radical to hold out for a more richly nuanced and liberating version of God. A queer lens—offering a skewed and disruptive attention to what is already there and what has been excluded—reappraises our traditions and invites us to locate our weirdness and particularity in a God who receives our actual bodies with joy. Jesus has so often been sanitized. This does no honor to the biblical story of a God whose living body is pierced and penetrated and whose risen body bears the marks of trauma into heaven. Whether we identify as queer or not, a picture of God or humanity that edits out all that seems strange is not a vision of a life-giving world.\nDoc 5(Title: What’s So Queer About the Ascension?) Today’s reflection is by Bondings 2.0 contributor Allison Connelly, whose bio is available here.\nToday’s liturgical readings for the Solemnity of the Ascension can be found here. Note that for some dioceses where the solemnity was marked last Thursday, today’s readings at Mass may be different.\nThere’s something incredibly queer about the Ascension. This ancient feast, observed as early as the fifth century C.E. and celebrated in some places last Thursday, is marked this Sunday, too. What stories do today’s readings tell—and why are these so queer? Let me explain.\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus promises to be with the disciples always, to the end of the age. In Acts, Jesus tells his disciples that they will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them, and he is then lifted up and hidden from their view by a cloud. Two strangers dressed in white pop in to tell the disciples, “Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way.“ Importantly, in our second reading – which gives no particular account of the act of Ascension, but an image of its heavenly result – describes Jesus seated at the right hand of God, as head over the church, “which is his body.”\nSo to clarify: Jesus will be with the disciples always, but not bodily, and Jesus is also bodily in heaven, and will return bodily from heaven. Right? Ok. But wait: his body is on earth, because his body is the church. And when Jesus leaves, the Holy Spirit appears, swapping one Person of God for another. But then again, Jesus doesn’t leave, because he says that he will be with the disciples always. How do we make sense of so many seeming contradictions?\nAs I said, the Ascension readings seem very queer to me. First, the body of readings is about transition and transformation: from earth to heaven, from Christ to Spirit, from human body to church-y body. Who understands this trans-ition and trans-formation more than queer and trans people? We constantly transition and transform: our wardrobes, our make-up, our pronouns, our names, our identities, our gender presentation, our politics, even our fundamental self-understanding. Jesus instructs his disciples – and, by extension, all of us – to bear witness to him, to the Divine, and this is our witness as LGBTQ+ people: that transition and transformation can, at their best, bring us closer to what is true, what is authentic, and what is human.\nThese readings are queer to me in another way, too, in the sense of “queer” as a verb. When used as a verb, “to queer” means to intentionally subvert or challenge our normative and binary assumptions and systems of operation (including but not limited to our defaults of hetero- or cis-normativity), often through absurdity or exaggeration, opening new possibilities that blur our boundaries and allow space for fluidity.\nIf the Ascension isn’t “absurdity” and “exaggeration” I don’t know what it is! Jesus is talking to his disciples, then suddenly raised up physically above them, then hidden behind a cloud, and then two strangers show up out of nowhere and start lecturing his friends? I’ve seen drag shows with less drama.\nIn the Ascension, and in the stories we encounter today, everything is “yes/and,” challenging our normative, human fixation on “either/or.” Jesus has left us and is with us always. Jesus’ body is in heaven and his body is the church on earth. Jesus will return physically from heaven and is present now, mysteriously, through the Spirit.\nQueering is also “subversive” and “opens new possibilities,” which I find abundantly clear in the Ascension. When Jesus ascends bodily into heaven, he subverts all of our binary expectations about the separation of what is “human” from what is “Divine.” With his physical body in heaven and his earthly body as the Church, he opens new possibilities for our human bodies to participate in the life of Christ through ritual and community.

This suggests potential conflicts of interest and may limit his effectiveness in enforcing laws or investigating similar matters.\n\n- **Rex Tillerson**: His extensive experience with Russian energy projects and his relationship with Putin raise concerns about his impartiality in matters involving Russia. This could affect his ability to represent U.S. interests in diplomatic relations with Russia.\n\n- **Jared Kushner**: His meetings with Russian officials and failure to disclose these contacts could lead to questions about his loyalty and potential conflicts of interest. His role as a senior advisor might also suggest a closer connection to Russia than expected.\n\n- **Donald Trump, Jr.**: His meetings with Russian officials and the revelation that he did not disclose these contacts when applying for security clearance indicate a lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest.\n\n- **Paul Manafort**: His history of working for pro-Russian entities and his involvement in the campaign raises concerns about his impartiality and potential influence over policy decisions.\n\nGiven these factors, Trump's cabinet picks foreshadow a presidency that may face significant scrutiny and challenges related to transparency, conflicts of interest, and potential biases. The extent of their power will depend on how they navigate these issues and the level of scrutiny they face from Congress and the public.\n\nIn terms of power, each cabinet member will have significant influence over their respective departments and the policies they implement.

Once reports of his meetings with Kislyak surfaced, Sessions recused himself from any investigation into Russia's interference in our 2016 presidential election. Many officials are continuing to call for his resignation.\n- Rex Tillerson: Tillerson, President Trump's former Secretary of State, worked on energy projects in Russia for two decades during his career at Exxon.

He has also been quoted saying that his father's businesses \"see a lot of money pouring in from Russia\", and that he had visited Russia on business over a half-dozen times. In June 2016, he met with a Russian billionaire, Emin Agalarov, under the premise that Emin had \"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia\" from the Crown prosecutor of Russia, and that this was part of \"Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n- Paul Manafort: Manafort, who has business connections to Russia and Ukraine, was hired as Trump's campaign manager in March 2016.

It was recently revealed by AP that Manafort proposed in a strategy plan from as early as June 2005 that he would work to influence politics, business deals, and media inside the U.S. and Europe to benefit Putin. This plan was pitched to Oleg Deripaska, a \"Russian aluminum magnate\" with close ties to Putin. Manafort eventually signed a $10 million contract with Deripaska in early 2006. The Trump Administration and Manafort have both said that Manafort never worked for Russian interests. Since the FBI confirmed in a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 20 that investigators are examining whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, the White House has made attempts to distance itself from Manafort, claiming that he played \"a very limited role\" in the campaign, despite his clear leadership role as campaign chairman leading up to the Republican National Convention. On October 27, 2017, Manafort was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy against the United States, among other charges.\n- Ca\nDoc 2(Title: Election 2016) The hidden sexism that could sway the election\nBy Daniel Bush\nPhotography by Greg Neiser and Kevin Kopanski\nDesign by Megan Crigger and Vanessa Dennis\nEdited by Jenny Marder and Travis Daub\nArmando Manno was in a good mood. His bartending shift at Louie's Bar & Grill in Akron, Ohio was almost over, and the Cleveland Cavaliers were ahead in the first quarter of a pivotal playoff game. It was May 25, near the end of the primary season, and talk had shifted to the presidential election. “Trump is going to make the right moves,” Manno, the son of Italian immigrants and a lifelong Republican, said as he wiped down the bar. “You don’t become a gazillionaire if you don’t know what you’re doing. He’s gotta have something upstairs.” As for Hillary Clinton, Manno said that he didn't want her in the White House. She was untrustworthy and willing to say anything to get elected, he said. And she possessed another, more fundamental shortcoming, Manno added: her gender. “Nothing against women,\" he said, \"but I don’t want a woman president right now.”\nManno laughed and gave a sheepish, that’s-just-how-I-feel shrug. As he turned away, a waitress named Mary Stone quietly offered a different point of view. Though she’s also planning to vote for Trump in the fall, Stone said she could relate to the cultural barriers that Clinton faces as a woman. “Men are still chauvinistic enough to think that women can’t do the same job as them. And I think that’s an issue.”\nHeading into the general election, Clinton has a wide lead over Donald Trump among minority and female voters. But Clinton, who made history last week as the first woman to clinch the nomination of a major U.S. party, has struggled with the one big voting bloc that’s truly up for grabs in 2016: moderate white men. White men also happen to be Trump’s base. If he doesn’t get a record number of them to turn out, it’s hard to see how he wins the presidency. Women, African-Americans, and Latinos will still play a crucial role in the race. They skew Democratic and anti-Trump. If Clinton keeps that coalition together, she can afford to lose some white men. But she can’t afford to lose too many.\nThe Clinton campaign knows this. Clinton spent significant time in the primaries courting white male voters — in particular white, mostly working-class men in the key Rust Belt and Midwestern swing states that usually decide presidential elections. And yet, despite all the effort, the results were abysmal. Clinton lost the overall male vote to Bernie Sanders by an average of 10 points in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin, according to an analysis of exit poll data. She also lost men by double-digits in states as varied as Nevada, Connecticut and Oklahoma. In contrast, she won the male vote by wide margins in states that have large numbers of African-American and Latino voters. In short, white men are the last holdout.\nBrian Brown, a registered Independent, on his motorcycle in downtown Canton, Ohio. Brown said that he thinks Hillary Clinton's gender will be an obstacle for some voters in the general election. \"There will be people who won’t vote for her because she’s a woman,\" Brown said. Right: The white male vote in Canton and other Rust Belt cities and towns will play a large role in the general election.\nFemale candidates have long faced more resistance, and received less support from men and women alike, even though the percentage of people who say they feel comfortable voting for women has gone steadily up. In 1937, just 33 percent of Americans said they would vote for a female presidential candidate, according to Gallup's first poll on the subject. By 2015, that number had climbed to 92 percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.\nObviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voter\nDoc 3(Title: untable policing and criminal justice practices to enhance public trust and public safety; protect the census and affirm that apportionment counts include all people; and much more.)

Many of the actions listed in this order would be in direct conflict with much of the Supreme Court’s opinion in Bostock v. Clayton County, binding precedent interpreting Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex in the workplace.

    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, countries can and should be actively involved in protecting global resources like the rainforest. This involvement typically includes:\n\n1. **Collaborative Efforts**: Countries can work together through international organizations and agreements to set and enforce standards for sustainable resource management. For example, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and REDD+ programs are designed to promote responsible forest management and reduce deforestation.\n\n2. **Financial Support**: Providing financial assistance to countries and communities to support conservation efforts and sustainable development projects. This can include grants, loans, and investment in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.\n\n3. **Policy Advocacy**: Encouraging domestic and international policies that support conservation and sustainable practices. This includes supporting legislation that bans the import of products linked to illegal deforestation and promoting policies that enhance supply chain transparency and traceability.\n\n4. **Infrastructure Planning**: Ensuring that infrastructure projects are planned and executed in a way that minimizes negative impacts on forests and the environment. This involves working closely with local communities, governments, and other stakeholders to develop and implement sustainable infrastructure designs.\n\n5. **Education and Awareness**: Raising awareness about the importance of preserving rainforests and the consequences of deforestation.

We collaborate with top-tier businesses across sectors—from pulp and paper industry leaders to major healthcare and technology companies. We engage them through [Forests Forward](https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/forests-forward), a signature WWF program for corporate action in support of nature, climate, and people. WWF’s local and global experts advise companies on everything from sourcing responsibly to supporting landscape efforts like restoration and improved management. In doing so, WWF helps corporate partners unlock the power of forests to achieve complex goals with meaningful results for our planet.\n\n![Image 1: Legally harvested timber](https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/images/Legally_harvested_timber/portrait_small/22huy0svk1_deforestation_what_wwf_doing_GFTNHI_208977.jpg)\n\nWWF's Forests Forward program works with companies to identify legal sources of timber.\n\n### Channeling Finance for Conservation\n\nTo slow, halt, and reverse the rate of deforestation, WWF engages with governments, local communities, and other stakeholders in countries’ forest landscapes through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation ([REDD+](https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/saving-forests-with-redd)) programs. REDD+ is an approach in which financial incentives are offered to developing countries that create and implement strategies to manage and use their forests responsibly.\n\nWWF also advocates for group funding to protect forests. For instance, the World Bank established the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, a multidonor fund comprised of governments and nongovernmental entities that help countries prepare to implement REDD+ and support REDD+ results-based payments.\n\n### Strengthening and Applying Certification Standards\n\nTo ensure forests are well managed, WWF has helped strengthen and apply certification standards for products made with materials from forests through the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certification system. Additionally, WWF ensures agricultural lands are responsibly managed and do not encroach upon forests by engaging with nonprofit organizations that develop and implement global certification standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil™ (RSPO) and the Round Table on Responsible Soy Association (RTRS). WWF works with a consortium of leading global companies with impacts and dependencies on forests to halt and reverse forest loss.\n\n### Incorporating Sustainability into Infrastructure\n\nWWF is both enhancing the management of natural infrastructure and addressing infrastructure-related drivers of deforestation and degradation. We do this by increasing global understanding of the natural infrastructure already delivering the services we need and how to manage and protect these systems in perpetuity. WWF works with governments and communities to help reach their development vision across landscapes in ways that will avoid deforestation and degradation of ecosystem services through careful spatial planning and innovative infrastructure design.\n\nWWF also aims to influence the financing of roads, railroads, power lines, mines, and other infrastructure, largely by ensuring that the value of forests is factored into decisions about where and how to create or expand infrastructure. This requires a comprehensive approach that includes collaborating with local communities, experts, researchers, engineers, corporations, financial institutions, training institutions, and governments. These partnerships can influence and fundamentally transform how infrastructure is planned, built, and operated—and secure the natural infrastructure we all rely upon. The ultimate goals: Infrastructure avoids negative impacts on forests and the climate or significantly reduces its impacts\nDoc 2(Title:  | Forest co-benefits report 2025) 14 October 2025\nTropical forests with high deforestation risk cover about 391 million hectares – roughly the size of the European Union.

These partnerships can influence and fundamentally transform how infrastructure is planned, built, and operated—and secure the natural infrastructure we all rely upon. The ultimate goals: Infrastructure avoids negative impacts on forests and the climate or significantly reduces its impacts where avoidance is not feasible. Natural infrastructure is well managed. And infrastructure design conserves or restores nature, maintains large intact forested areas and habitat connectivity, increases resilience, and mitigates the effects of climate change.\n\n### Creating and Properly Managing Conservation Areas\n\nMost conservation areas (primarily parks called protected areas) are not well funded. As a result, they are not well managed, which often leads to deforestation. One way to address this challenge is to use a comprehensive conservation and financing approach known as Project Finance for Permanence ([PFP](https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/permanently-protecting-forests)). Adaptable to the needs and goals of each specific context, PFP initiatives secure all necessary policy changes and funding and bind them together in a single agreement. This ensures large-scale systems of conservation areas are well managed, sustainably financed, and benefit the communities who depend on them. By implementing core strategies for durable biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation—including community engagement, sustainable finance mechanisms, policy, and capacity-building of local and national organizations—PFPs ensure long-term conservation. WWF has already helped launch PFP initiatives in Bhutan, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru and is developing several more over the coming years.\n\nWWF also helps safeguard biodiversity outside of formal protected areas by supporting other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). OECMs are led by government agencies, private individuals, sectoral actors, Indigenous peoples, and/or local communities. They can include a wide range of areas, from sacred and cultural sites to intact forests. OECMs complement protected areas by conserving important biodiversity, ecological functions, and ecosystem services; promoting ecological connectivity between sites and across conservation networks; and contributing to climate resilience.\n\n### Influencing Policy\n\nEffective policies are essential to help stop deforestation. WWF works with countries that import forest-risk commodities—such as soy, timber, cocoa, beef, rubber, and palm oil—to develop policies that improve supply chain traceability and transparency and prevent the trade of materials that drive deforestation and the conversion of critical ecosystems.\n\nWWF further advocates for policies that ensure that US supply chains for wood-based products like paper and furniture aren’t linked to the illegal timber trade fueling global deforestation. WWF urges lawmakers to fully enforce the [Lacey Act Amendments of 2008](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/joint-recommendations-to-halt-the-illegal-timber-trade-utilize-the-lacey-act-amendments-of-2008), which made the United States the first country to ban the trafficking of products containing illegally sourced wood. This law has helped reduce imports of illegally sourced wood products by 32% to 44%, but insufficient resources from the federal government and sporadic enforcement limit its effectiveness. WWF also supports legislation such as the [FOREST Act](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/forest-act) that would prevent the importation of agricultural products linked to illegal deforestation.\nDoc 4(Title:  (GBO-5) calls for a shift away from “business as usual” across a range of human activities. The report outlines eight transitions that recognize the value of biodiversity, the need to restore the ecosystems on which all human activity de-pends, and the urgency of reducing the negative impacts of such activity. It also shows that governments will need to scale up national ambitions in support of the new Global Biodiversity Framework and ensure that all necessary resources are mobilized, and the enabling environment strengthened.)

President Donald Trump’s refusal to disclose his tax returns throughout his campaigns and presidency has fueled multiple legislative public disclosure proposals. In March 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation as part of the For the People Act of 2021 that would require Presidents, Vice Presidents, and nominees to publicly disclose several years of their tax returns through the Federal Election Commission. Many state legislatures have considered similar requirements for candidates who seek to appear on state primary and general election ballots. Proponents of these measures argue that public disclosure of tax returns could expose conflicts of interest, reveal the President’s and candidates’ annual tax liability and tax rates, and, most importantly, enable the public to observe whether the President or candidates have engaged in tax evasion, pursued tax shelters and other tax avoidance, and participated in audits or tax controversies with the IRS.) This Article intervenes in the disclosure debate by exploring whether, and to what extent, mandatory public disclosure of tax returns would achieve the policy objective of enabling voters to observe candidates’ and elected officials’ compliance with the tax law. To consider this question, the Article examines information presented in federal income tax returns and reviews the publicly disclosed tax returns of Presidents, Vice Presidents, and major party candidates from President Richard Nixon through President Joseph Biden. The primary claim of this Article is that mandatory public disclosure of an elected official’s or candidate’s federal income tax returns alone would provide the public with only a partial and one-sided view of that individual’s tax compliance. This incomplete image is due to the structure of the federal income tax and tax returns themselves and opportunities for strategic reporting and disclosure by elected officials and candidates.\nAt the same time, the Article argues that public disclosure of tax compliance, if it were possible, could provide valuable information to the electorate, increase public understanding of the tax system, and enable public oversight over the taxing authority. To enhance the public’s ability to evaluate tax compliance, the Article presents an alternative model of mandatory public disclosure that would include public disclosure not only of tax returns, but also of documents and processes that would highlight tax actions of both candidates and elected officials and the IRS.\nProfessor of Law and Faculty Director of Strategic Initiatives, University of California, Irvine School of Law.\nDoc 2(Title: Wyden Offers Bill Calling On President-Elect Trump, Future Presidential Nominees To Release Tax Returns) Measure would give insight into foreign deals, increase transparency\nWASHINGTON - Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today introduced a bill requiring President-Elect Trump to release his recent tax returns in order to give the public honest insight into the President-Elect's actions, values and foreign business dealings.\n\"The fact that the president-elect refuses to release his tax returns is a tragic failure of transparency, and it needs to be corrected. With President-Elect Trump flouting bipartisan traditions of disclosure while engaging with foreign leaders at the highest level, it's more important than ever to ensure that the Commander-in-Chief isn't playing by a different set of rules.\" said Wyden.\nThe Presidential Tax Transparency Act requires all sitting presidents to release their most recent 3 years of tax returns to the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). It also requires that, within 15 days of becoming the nominee at the party convention, presidential nominees must release their most recent 3 years of tax returns to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Should the sitting president or future candidates refuse to comply, the Treasury Secretary will be required to provide the tax returns directly to the OGE or FEC respectively for public release.\n\"President-Elect Trump's tax returns will deliver honest answers to key questions from the American public,\" said Wyden. \"Are you keeping your money offshore?

Given the President’s evasive maneuvering, Congress has a constitutional responsibility to obtain the records needed to perform rigorous, unbiased oversight,” DelBene said. “If the President is serious about working on tax reform, people deserve to know what conflicts of interest – foreign or domestic – may influence his decision-making.

Trump did not return the material voluntarily and submit to an investigation. He hid material. He had his lawyers lie to investigators. It required a search warrant to recover a great deal of the classified material—and prosecutors are still not sure they recovered all of it. There were repeated acts of obstruction that involved several other people who worked at Mar-a-Lago. These are acts that prosecutors will indict irrespective of the merits of the underlying crime.) What Should Be Done?\nThe story Hur tells speaks to two policy problems that are larger than Biden and that really need to be addressed. The first is the problem of the difficulty Biden’s staff had when he was vice president recovering and storing the classified material he used in non-secure locations. There is nothing illegal or improper about this behavior on Biden’s part; the vice president works everywhere and he is not covered by the normal rules of handling classified material. The problem is a staffing issue. When the vice president reads classified briefing material at home, who will make sure it’s stored properly? When he travels with it and takes it to Delaware—which he is entitled to do—who will make sure it is recovered and returned to a proper storage location?\nA second policy issue involves Biden’s diaries. Biden is correct that other presidents and vice presidents before him have treated their personal diaries, classified information and all, as personal property and taken them with them when they leave office. That said, storing diaries full of highly sensitive material in unsecured locations is completely unacceptable—whatever the property interests may be in the books themselves. An expectation that the National Archives becomes the custodian of such material, or that it builds appropriate storage for it at the houses of former presidents and vice presidents seems appropriate. And more broadly, there clearly needs to be a better process for making sure classified material doesn’t leave with former presidents and vice presidents during transitions.\nBut there’s a level here that is not about policy. It is about behavior. And it’s behavior for which Biden needs to take responsibility. Biden struck a defiant tone in response to the report, angry not merely at the suggestion that his memory was flawed but at the very notion that he had mishandled classified material. During the press conference Biden held following the release of the report, he insisted, “I did not share classified information. I did not share it … [w]ith my ghostwriter, I did not. Guarantee you, I did not.”\nThe facts of the report belie his indignance. Biden may not imagine himself as the sort of man who mishandles classified material, but he did, in fact, do so. And he should acknowledge that. As former CIA Acting Director Michael Morell put it this weekend on CBS’s Face the Nation:\nSo, I agree, 100 percent, that we need a new policy for how this is done at the end of administrations. A hundred percent. I think he needs to go a little bit further in the apology. I think he needs to say, I should not have had this material, I put national security at risk. I apologize to the American people for that. I apologize to the intelligence community, in particular to those CIA officers who put their lives at risk to collect some of it. There was CIA material in here. And it's not going to happen again. And I'm going to make sure of that by making changes. A more full- throated apology.\nSuch a statement would further distinguish Biden’s case from Trump’s.\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the gathered information, it appears that there is significant debate around the requirement for presidents to release their tax returns.

    "question": "Should all prisons be governmentally owned and run?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information gathered, it seems that private prisons can be effective in certain contexts, particularly when they are subject to performance-based contracts that incentivize good behavior and lower recidivism rates. These contracts can ensure that the private sector is accountable for outcomes such as reduced recidivism and improved living conditions for inmates. Additionally, private prisons often offer innovative programs aimed at rehabilitation and reintegration, which can help reduce the likelihood of inmates returning to prison.\n\nHowever, there are also concerns about the potential exploitation of both employees and inmates by private prison operators, as well as issues around staffing and potential overcrowding. Private prisons may also face financial incentives that prioritize profit over the humane treatment of prisoners.\n\nGiven these points, the decision on whether all prisons should be governmentally owned and run depends on the specific context and goals of the prison system. Government-run prisons may offer greater control over conditions and treatment, but private prisons, when properly regulated and contracted, can provide innovative solutions and potentially more efficient operation. Therefore, it might be beneficial to have a mix of both government and private prisons, with strict regulations and performance metrics in place to ensure that the interests of inmates are protected and that the system operates effectively. </think>\n<answer> No, not all prisons should necessarily be governmentally owned and run.

Pro 2: Private prisons can transform the broken government-run prison system.\n“Private prisons are a tool, and like all tools, you can use them well or use them poorly,” says Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation. [17]\nExamples of using private prisons well are found in Australia and New Zealand, where private prisons have performance-based contracts with the government. According to the Brennan Center’s Lauren-Brooke Eisen, the prisons earn “bonuses for doing better than government prisons at cutting recidivism. They get an even bigger bonus if they beat the government at reducing recidivism among their indigenous populations. And prison companies are charged for what the government deems as unacceptable events like riots, escapes and unnatural deaths.” [18]\nBy implementing these kinds of contracts, “the private sector was responsible for designing the solution that would achieve the desired social outcome,” explains the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation at Georgetown University. [19]\n“The prison is designed for rehabilitation. The strength of these public-private partnerships is that they bring the best practices and innovation from all over the world, allowing local authorities to benefit not only from private capital but also from the best people and best practices from other countries,” says Oliver Brousse, chief executive of the John Laing Investment Group, which built a prison in New Zealand on the basis of such contracts. [18]\nPro 3: Private prisons offer innovative programs to lower the rates of re-imprisonment.\nRecidivism is the tendency of those who have committed a criminal act to commit another criminal act, likely landing inmates back in prison.\nGEO Group, Inc., the American private prison conglomerate, offers individual treatment plans, drug abuse education and treatment, adult education GED (general education) courses, life skills courses, parenting and family reintegration, anger management, and work readiness vocational skills. The programs are offered as in-custody, residential, and nonresidential options, allowing people access to the programs while in prison, out on parole or probation, or post-prison while reintegrating into their communities. [20]0]\n“If we want to establish a prison that focuses on rehabilitation and reintegration, we have to give the private sector the space to innovate. If we don’t give them the opportunity to do things differently, we will just get back what we already have,” argues Rachael Cole, former public-private partnership integration director for the New Zealand Department of Corrections. [18]\nA New Zealand prison operated by Serco, a British company, has men make their own meals, do their own laundry, schedule their own family and medical appointments, and maintain a résumé to apply for facility jobs. The prison also responds to the job market—for example, opening cafés to train the men as baristas. Another prison in New Zealand includes a cultural center for Maori inmates, designed to reduce recidivism among Indigenous populations. [18][21]\nPrograms that focus on inmate reentry into society and deal with drug abuse and other problems can lower recidivism rates, which in turn can reduce prison populations and lessen overcrowding and related dangers.\nCon Arguments\n(Go to Pro Arguments)Con 1: Private prisons exploit employees and prisoners for corporate gain.\nPrivate prisons paid staff $0.38 less per hour than public prisons—$14,901 less in yearly salaries—and required 58 fewer hours of training prior to service than public prisons, leaving staff members less prepared to do their jobs, which contributed to a 43 percent turnover rate, as compared to 15 percent for public prisons.

According to a March 11, 2025 Prison Policy Initiative study, the country’s multi-tiered system of incarceration held:\nnearly 2 million people in 1,566 state prisons, 98 federal prisons, 3,116 local jails, 1,277 juvenile correctional facilities, 133 immigration detention facilities, and 80 Indian country jails, as well as in military prisons, civil commitment centers, state psychiatric hospitals, and prisons in the U.S. territories — at a system-wide cost of at least $182 billion each year. [1][41][44]\nOne of the major innovations in American incarceration has been the rise of private prisons. Prison privatization generally operates in one of three ways: private companies provide services to a government-owned and managed prison, such as building maintenance, food supplies, or vocational training; private companies manage government-owned facilities; or private companies own and operate the prisons and charge the government to house inmates. [2]\nIn the United States, private prisons have their roots in slavery. Some privately owned prisons held enslaved people while the slave trade continued after the importation of enslaved people was banned in 1807. Recaptured runaways were also imprisoned in private facilities, as were Black people who were born free and then illegally captured and sold into slavery. Many plantations were turned into private prisons from the American Civil War forward; for example, the Angola Plantation became the Louisiana State Penitentiary (nicknamed “Angola” for the African homeland where many of the plantation’s enslaved people came from), the largest maximum-security prison in the country. In 2000 the Vann Plantation in North Carolina was opened as the private minimum-security Rivers Correctional Facility (operated by GEO Group). [2][3][4][5][6]\nIn the 19th century inmates in private prisons were commonly used for labor via “convict leasing,” in which the prison owners were paid for the labor of the inmates. According to the Innocence Project, Jim Crow laws after the Civil War ensured that the newly freed Black population was imprisoned at high rates for petty or nonexistent crimes in order to maintain the labor force needed for picking cotton and other labor previously performed by enslaved people. However, the practice of convict leasing extended beyond the American South. California awarded private management contracts for San Quentin State Prison in order to allow the winning bidder leasing rights to the convicts until 1860. Convict leasing faded in the early 20th century as states banned the practice and shifted to forced farming and other labor on the land of the prisons themselves. [2][3][7][8][9][10]\nWhat Americans think of now as a private prison is an institution owned by a corporate conglomerate such as CoreCivic, GEO Group, LaSalle Corrections, or Management and Training Corporation. This sort of private prison began operations in 1984, when the prison population was skyrocketing because of the ongoing war on drugs. The first private facility opened in Tennessee, where prison overcrowding became such a problem that a federal judge ordered the state to stop sending convicted criminals to its prisons. The private prisons claimed that, because of new construction designs and electronic surveillance, they could operate more efficiently and less expensively with less staff, a claim later disputed. In 1987 Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (now GEO Group) won a federal contract to also run an immigration detention center, further expanding the focus of private prisons. [11][12][13]\nIn 2016 the federal government announced it would phase out the use of private prisons under the administration of President Barack Obama, but this policy was rescinded by President Donald Tr\nDoc 4(Title: Private Prisons in the United States) Twenty-seven states and the federal government incarcerated 90,873 people in private prisons in 2022, representing 8% of the total state and federal prison population.\nRelated to: Incarceration, Sentencing Reform\nPrivate for-profit prisons incarcerated 90,873 American residents in 2022, representing 8% of the total state and federal prison population. Since 2000, the number of people housed in private prisons has increased 5%.\nHarmful crime policies of the 1980s and beyond fueled a rapid expansion in the nation’s prison population. The resulting burden on the public sector led to the modern emergence of for-profit prisons in many states and the federal system. Of the 1.2 million people in federal and state prisons, 8%, or 90,873 people, were in private prisons as of year end 2022.1\nStates show significant variation in the use of private prisons. At one end of the spectrum, Montana incarcerates almost half of its prison population in privately run facilities, but in another 23 states, private prisons are not used at all. A total of 27 states and the federal government use private corporations like GEO Group, Core Civic,2 LaSalle Corrections, and Management and Training Corporation to run some of their corrections facilities.\nMontana is not alone in its heavy reliance on private prisons. Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, New Mexico, and Tennessee rely considerably on private prisons for housing sentenced people. In these states, between 20% and 39% of the prison population resides in a for-profit prison (See Table 1).\n* = Growth began at zero.\n** = Wisconsin does not have anyone housed at private facilities. However, when a person\nis housed out of state under the Interstate Corrections Compact or the Intergovernmental\nAgreement, Wisconsin does not track if the facility is a private facility or state or federally owned facility.\n*** = The Federal count includes Washington, DC residents convicted of a felony. As of December 31, 2001, DC residents convicted of a felony are the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\nSource: Carson, E. A, & Kluckow, R. (2023). Prisoners in 2022 – Statistical Tables. Bureau of Justice Statistics. See Table 4 and Table 14.\nThe proportion of imprisoned people in private facilities compared to public facilities has not changed considerably in the past 20 years. In 2000, 8% of the imprisoned population was also in private facilities; but fluctuations in the total number of people imprisoned over 20 years have translated to a 5% rise in the number of people serving their sentence in private prisons. Since 2012, however, the population in private prisons has decreased significantly.\nFIGURE 1. Percent of Imprisoned People in Private Prisons, 2021\nFIGURE 2. Number of People in Private Prisons, 2000-2022\nHistorically, the largest prison system relying on privatization has been the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Since 2000, the BOP’s reliance on private facilities has decreased by 11%. The number of people in federal custody in its private facilities totaled 13,834 people in 2022.3 This decrease can be attributed to President Joseph Biden’s executive order to phase out the BOP’s use of private prison beds. A substantial number of people remain incarcerated, though, in these for-profit prisons.\nUnder the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there is an average of 28,289 people held daily in immigrant detention, and it is estimated 79% of this population is held in privately run facilities.4\nPolitical influences have been instrumental in securing the growth of for-profit private prisons. Because the prison population grew in 2022 for the first time in a decade, the privatization debate will likely intensify as opportunities for the prison industry may increase as corporations seek to make profits in related corrections areas.\nDoc 5(Title: state-funded prisons as well, and seriously consider the abolition of all prisons—as they are all for profit.” [33][34]) One needs to assess, adds Woods Ervin, a prison abolitionist with Critical Resistance, “the rate at which the prison-industrial complex is able to actually address rape and murder. We’ve spent astronomical amounts of our budgets at the municipal level, at the federal level, on policing and caging people. And yet I don’t think that people feel any safer from the threat of sexual assault or the threat of murder. What is the prison-industrial complex doing to actually solve those problems in our society?” [35]\nAbolitionism focuses on community-level issues to prevent the concerns that lead to incarceration in the first place.

These contracts can ensure that the private sector is accountable for outcomes such as reduced recidivism and improved living conditions for inmates. Additionally, private prisons often offer innovative programs aimed at rehabilitation and reintegration, which can help reduce the likelihood of inmates returning to prison.\n\nHowever, there are also concerns about the potential exploitation of both employees and inmates by private prison operators, as well as issues around staffing and potential overcrowding. Private prisons may also face financial incentives that prioritize profit over the humane treatment of prisoners.\n\nGiven these points, the decision on whether all prisons should be governmentally owned and run depends on the specific context and goals of the prison system. Government-run prisons may offer greater control over conditions and treatment, but private prisons, when properly regulated and contracted, can provide innovative solutions and potentially more efficient operation. Therefore, it might be beneficial to have a mix of both government and private prisons, with strict regulations and performance metrics in place to ensure that the interests of inmates are protected and that the system operates effectively. </think>\n<answer> No, not all prisons should necessarily be governmentally owned and run. While government-run prisons offer control over conditions and treatment, private prisons, when properly regulated and contracted, can provide innovative solutions and potentially more efficient operation.

    "question": "In fighting with income inequality, which way is more efficient: the libertarian or the socialist?",
    "agent_answer": "From the provided documents, it appears that both sides recognize the complexity of the issue and the importance of a balanced approach. Libertarians and conservatives tend to focus on the role of individual responsibility and the importance of maintaining a robust safety net for the truly needy while promoting work and personal responsibility. They argue that excessive government intervention can stifle economic growth and discourage personal initiative.\n\nSocialists and progressives advocate for more extensive government intervention to address income inequality through measures such as progressive taxation, redistribution of wealth, and substantial public investment in infrastructure, education, and social services. They argue that systemic issues require systemic solutions and that the government has a role in ensuring economic equality and social justice.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, it is difficult to definitively state which approach is more efficient without considering specific contexts and outcomes. Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses. Libertarians might argue that their approach encourages innovation and entrepreneurship, potentially leading to long-term economic growth and reduced inequality. Socialists might argue that their approach ensures immediate relief and long-term stability through comprehensive social programs and policies aimed at reducing inequality.\n\nGiven the complexity and the context-specific nature of these issues, neither approach can be universally declared more efficient. The most effective solution likely depends on the specific socio-economic conditions and political climate of a given society.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Neither approach can be definitively declared more efficient in all contexts.

They often support policies that allow markets to operate freely, arguing that competition and innovation will naturally reduce income disparities over time.\n\nSocialists, on the other hand, generally believe in significant government intervention to redistribute wealth more evenly.

The rich have gotten richer faster than the poor have moved up. And we might be concerned with that because that also reflects on opportunity. And as an opportunity society, as an equal opportunity society, we should all be really concerned with that.) But the extent that we can get away from this notion that the rich are stealing from the poor, then we can look at this in I think in a way that's constructive. Why? Because the rich are our neighbors and the poor are our neighbors, and everybody else should be our neighbors and they're all our kids. And I think getting away from that rhetoric is really important.\nAnd then the last point, actually, as we come to consensus is remembering that capitalism or socialism or social democracy or any system is just a system. Look, it’s just a system. It’s just a machine. It’s like your car. You can do great good with it, you can do great evil with it. It can't go uninhibited. So far it can't drive on its own. It will soon enough. The economy never will be able to.\nCapitalism is nothing more than a system, and it must be predicated on right morals. It must be. Adam Smith taught me that. Adam Smith, the father of modern economics -- he wrote “The Wealth of Nations,” in 1776 -- 17 years before he wrote “The Theory of Moral sentiments,” which was a more important book because it talked about what it meant as a society to earn the right to have free enterprise, to have free economics. And it was true then, and it’s still true today.\nSo this is why this conference is so important. This conversation with the President of the United States is so important, from my point of view -- I say with appropriate humility -- is because we're talking about right morality toward our brothers and sisters, and built on that, that's when we can have an open discussion to get our capitalism right. And then the distribution of resources is only a tertiary question. (Applause.)\nMR. DIONNE: I still want to know how much infrastructure you're actually willing to vote for, but I’ll take --\nMR. BROOKS: $41 billion.\nMR. DIONNE: All right, it’s a start. We can negotiate.\nI want to -- this is in a way for both the President and Bob, because in this conversation about poverty, there’s kind of consensus on this stage that, yes, you need to care about family structure, it really matters, but if you don't worry about the economy, you're not sort of thinking about why the battering ram is against the family.\nAnd yet, this family conversation can make a lot of people feel uneasy because it sounds like either you're not taking politics seriously, or you're not taking the real economic pressure seriously. And I just want to share two things with the President and Bob, and have you respond.\nOne, as you can imagine, I asked a lot of smart people what they would ask about if they were in my position. And one very smart economist said, look, what we know is when we have really tight labor markets, unemployment down below -- down to 4 or even lower -- Kennedy, Johnson years, World War II, at the end of the Clinton years -- all kinds of good things start happening to poor people. So maybe, this person said, even though, he says, yes, family structure matters, let’s stop with the moral lectures and just run a really tight economic policy, and we could have some really good things happen to us.\nAnd then the other thing I wanted to share -- and I’m being pointed here, Mr. President, because you know and I’ve heard you talk about this, but not that often publicly, which is -- you know, I’ve heard you in those sessions you do with opinion reporters -- Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote something back in 2013 about your talk about what needs to happen inside the African American community -- I know you remember this: “Taking full measure of the Obama presidency thus far, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this White House has one way of addressing the social ills that afflict black people and particularly black youth, \nDoc 2(Title: d can operate via socialist principles. The only time something is taken away involuntarily in a socialist system is when individuals have monopolies and vast ill-gotten riches. (The only reason anything is “your property” anyway is the state. Without the state, titles and deeds to land, houses, cars, and so on are just pieces of paper. This means “anarcho-capitalism” is a contradiction of terms and truly support for the state.) It is right and just that the economic masters and tyrants (the parasites) have their ill-gotten riches and resources returned to the people. They profit hugely from stolen resources and labor that isn’t theirs. But somehow some working class “ancaps” truly believe they will be targeted for expropriation, as if their meager salaries even collectively compare to the resources and wealth of the billionaire class tyrants. They do not. Ancaps must see they are part of the 99% like the rest of us, not “temporarily embarrassed millionaires” as Steinbeck (or Wright) put it and join us in our struggle for true equality and freedom.)

An anti-government ideology then disinvests from those common goods and those things that draw us together. And that, in part, contributes to the fact that there’s less opportunity for our kids, all of our kids.\nNow, that’s not inevitable. A free market is perfectly compatible with also us making investment in good public schools, public universities; investments in public parks; investments in a whole bunch -- public infrastructure that grows our economy and spreads it around. But that’s, in part, what’s been under attack for the last 30 years. And so, in some ways, rather than soften the edges of the market, we’ve turbocharged it. And we have not been willing, I think, to make some of those common investments so that everybody can play a part in getting opportunity.\nNow, one other thing I’ve got to say about this is that even back in Bob’s day that was also happening. It’s just it was happening to black people. And so, in some ways, part of what’s changed is that those biases or those restrictions on who had access to resources that allowed them to climb out of poverty -- who had access to the firefighters job, who had access to the assembly line job, the blue-collar job that paid well enough to be in the middle class and then got you to the suburbs, and then the next generation was suddenly office workers -- all those things were foreclosed to a big chunk of the minority population in this country for decades.\nAnd that accumulated and built up. And over time, people with less and less resources, more and more strains -- because it’s hard being poor. People don’t like being poor. It’s time-consuming’ it’s stressful. It’s hard. And so over time, families frayed. Men who could not get jobs left. Mothers who are single are not able to read as much to their kids. So all that was happening 40 years ago to African Americans. And now what we’re seeing is that those same trends have accelerated and they’re spreading to the broader community.\nBut the pattern that, Bob, you’re recording in some of your stories is no different than what William Julius Wilson was talking about when he talked about the truly disadvantaged. So I say all this -- and I know that was not an answer to your question. (Laughter.) I will be willing to answer it, but I think it is important for us at the outset to acknowledge if, in fact, we are going to find common ground, then we also have to acknowledge that there are certain investments we are willing to make as a society, as a whole, in public schools and public universities; in, today, I believe early childhood education; in making sure that economic opportunity is available in communities that are isolated, and that somebody can get a job, and that there’s actually a train that takes folks to where the jobs are -- that broadband lines are in rural communities and not just in cities. And those things are not going to happen through market forces alone.\nAnd if that’s the case, then our government and our budgets have to reflect our willingness to make those investments. If we don’t make those investments, then we could agree on the earned income tax credit -- which I know Arthur believes in. We could agree on home visitation for low-income parents. All those things will make a difference, but the broader trends in our society will make it harder and harder for us to deal with both inequality and poverty.\nAnd so I think it’s important for us to recognize there is a genuine debate here, and that is what portion of our collective wealth and budget are we willing to invest in those things that allow a poor kid, whether in a rural town, or in Appalachia, or in the inner city, to access what they need both in terms of mentors and social networks, as well as decent books and computers and so forth, in order for them to succeed along the terms that Arthur\nDoc 4(Title:  that creates a couple of straw men. The stereotype is that you’ve got folks on the left who just want to pour more money into social programs, and don't care anything about culture or parenting or family structures, and that's one stereotype. And then you’ve got cold-hearted, free market, capitalist types who are reading Ayn Rand and -- (laughter) -- think everybody are moochers. And I think the truth is more complicated.) I think that there are those on the conservative spectrum who deeply care about the least of these, deeply care about the poor; exhibit that through their churches, through community groups, through philanthropic efforts, but are suspicious of what government can do. And then there are those on the left who I think are in the trenches every day and see how important parenting is and how important family structures are, and the connective tissue that holds communities together and recognize that that contributes to poverty when those structures fray, but also believe that government and resources can make a difference in creating an environment in which young people can succeed despite great odds.\nAnd it seems to me that if coming out of this conversation we can have a both/and conversation rather than either/or conversation, then we’ll be making some progress.\nAnd the last point I guess I want to make is I also want to emphasize we can do something about these issues. I think it is a mistake for us to suggest that somehow every effort we make has failed and we are powerless to address poverty. That’s just not true. First of all, just in absolute terms, the poverty rate when you take into account tax and transfer programs, has been reduced about 40 percent since 1967.\nNow, that does not lessen our concern about communities where poverty remains chronic. It does suggest, though, that we have been able to lessen poverty when we decide we want to do something about it. In every low-income community around the country, there are programs that work to provide ladders of opportunity to young people; we just haven't figured out how to scale them up.\nAnd so one of the things I’m always concerned about is cynicism. My Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough -- we take walks around the South Lawn, usually when the weather is good, and a lot of it is policy talk, sometimes it’s just talk about values. And one of our favorite sayings is, our job is to guard against cynicism, particularly in this town. And I think it’s important when it comes to dealing with issues of poverty for us to guard against cynicism, and not buy the idea that the poor will always be with us and there’s nothing we can do -- because there’s a lot we can do. The question is do we have the political will, the communal will to do something about it.\nMR. DIONNE: Thank you, Mr. President. I feel as a journalist maybe I’m the one representative of cynicism up here\n-- (laughter) -- so I’ll try to do my job. I want to go through the panel and come back to you, Mr. President. I want to invite Bob, and I’m going to encourage us to reach for solutions. But before we get there, I think it’s important to say that your book, Bob, your book, “Our Kids,” is above all a moral call on the country to think about all the kids in the country who have been left out as our kids, in some deep way. And you make the point that the better off and the poor are now so far apart that the fortunate don’t even see the lives of the unlucky and the left behind. You wrote, “Before I began this research, I was like that.”\nAnd following on what the President said, you insist that the decline in social mobility, the blocking of the American Dream for so many is a purple problem. And I may have some questions later on that, but I really would like you to lay out the red and blue components. And also, how do we break through a politics in which food stamp recipients are still somehow cast as privileged or the poor are demonized. But I’d like you to lay out sort of the moral call of your book.\nMR\nDoc 5(Title: overty is the thing I care about the most.) And in point of fact, 2 billion people around the world have been lifted up out of poverty because of ideas revolving around free enterprise and free trade, and the globalization of ideas of sharing through property rights and rule of law, and all the things that the President is talking about in policy debates right now.\nThat’s why I'm in this particular movement. But we’ve gotten into a partisan moment where we substitute a moral consensus about how we serve the least of these, our brothers and sisters, where we pretend that that moral consensus is impossible,+++++++ and we blow up policy differences until they become a holy war. That’s got to stop because it's completely unnecessary. (Applause.) And we can stop that, absolutely, with a couple of key principles.\nSo how are we on the center right talking about poverty in the most effective way? Number one is with a conceptual matter. We have a grave tendency on both the left and the right to talk about poor people as “the other.” Remember in Matthew 25, these are our brothers and sisters. Jim Olsen and I have this roadshow -- we go to campuses and everybody wants to set up something, right-left debates, and it never works out, because it turns out we both have a commitment to the teachings of the Savior when it comes to treating the least of these, our brothers and sisters.\nWhen you talk about people as your brothers and sisters you don’t talk about them as liabilities to manage. They’re not liabilities to manage. They’re assets to develop because every one of us made in God’s image is an asset to develop. That’s a completely different approach to poverty alleviation. That’s a human capital approach to poverty alleviation. That’s what we can do to stimulate that conversation on the political right, just as it can be on the political left.\nOne concept that rides along with that is to point out -- and this is what I do to many of my friends on Capitol Hill -- I remind them that just because people are on public assistance doesn’t mean they want to be on public assistance. And that’s the difference between people who factually are making a living and who are accepting public assistance. It's an important matter to remember about the motivations of people and humanizing them. And then the question is, how can we come together? How can we come together?\nI have, indeed, written that it's time to declare peace on the safety net. And I say that as a political conservative. Why? Because Ronald Reagan said that; because Friedrich Hayek said that. This is not a radical position. In fact, the social safety net is one of the greatest achievements of free enterprise -- that we could have the wealth and largesse as a society, that we can help take care of people who are poor that we've never even met. It's ahistoric; it's never happened before. We should be proud of that.\nBut then when I talk to conservative policymakers, and say how should you distinguish yourself from the traditional positions in a marketplace of ideas from progressives, you should also talk about the fact that the safety net should be limited to people who are truly indigent, as opposed to being spread around in a way that metastasizes into middle-class entitlements and imperils our economy.\nAnd the third part is that help should always come with the dignifying power of work to the extent that we can. Then we can have, with these three ideas -- declaring peace on the safety net, safety net only for the indigent, and always with work -- then we can have an interesting moral consensus and policy competition of ideas and maybe make some progress.\nMR. DIONNE: Thank you. In fact, I'm hoping people will challenge each other about what that actually means in terms of policy. And I want to invite the President to do that.\nI'm tempted, Mr. President, to ask you to sort of go in a couple of directions at once. One is, I am, again, hoping that you can enlist Arthur as your lobbyist on this\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the provided documents, it appears that both sides recognize the complexity of the issue and the importance of a balanced approach. Libertarians and conservatives tend to focus on the role of individual responsibility and the importance of maintaining a robust safety net for the truly needy while promoting work and personal responsibility. They argue that excessive government intervention can stifle economic growth and discourage personal initiative.\n\nSocialists and progressives advocate for more extensive government intervention to address income inequality through measures such as progressive taxation, redistribution of wealth, and substantial public investment in infrastructure, education, and social services. They argue that systemic issues require systemic solutions and that the government has a role in ensuring economic equality and social justice.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, it is difficult to definitively state which approach is more efficient without considering specific contexts and outcomes. Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses. Libertarians might argue that their approach encourages innovation and entrepreneurship, potentially leading to long-term economic growth and reduced inequality. Socialists might argue that their approach ensures immediate relief and long-term stability through comprehensive social programs and policies aimed at reducing inequality.\n\nGiven the complexity and the context-specific nature of these issues, neither approach can be universally declared more efficient. The most effective solution likely depends on the specific socio-economic conditions and political climate of a given society.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Neither approach can be definitively declared more efficient in all contexts.

Archived from the orig\nDoc 3(Title: Second impeachment of Donald Trump) Donald Trump, serving as the 45th president of the United States, was impeached for the second time on January 13, 2021, one week before his term expired. On that date, the House of Representatives adopted one article of impeachment against Trump: incitement of insurrection. On February 13, 2021, the Senate voted to acquit Trump on the article of impeachment.\nThe House of Representatives of the 117th U.S. Congress adopted one article of impeachment against Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\", stating that he had incited the January 6 attack of the U.S. Capitol. The House impeachment managers formally triggered the start of the impeachment trial on January 25 by delivering to the Senate the charge against Trump.[1] The trial in the Senate started on February 9.[2] At the trial in the Senate, 57 senators voted \"guilty\", which was less than the two-thirds majority needed (67) to convict Trump, and 43 senators voted \"not guilty\", resulting in Trump being acquitted of the charges on February 13, 2021.[3]\nThe trial was the first of its kind for a departed U.S. president: all other impeachment trials of presidents (those of Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Trump) occurred during their presidencies. Many Republican senators challenged the validity of holding an impeachment trial for a president no longer in office; proponents cited the Senate's 1876 trial of William W. Belknap, the secretary of war under President Ulysses S. Grant, who was impeached, but not convicted, after resigning from office immediately before a House vote on his impeachment.[4]\nThis impeachment was the fourth impeachment of a U.S. president, and the second of Trump; his first impeachment was in December 2019.[5][6]\nIn August 2023, Trump was twice indicted for the conduct at issue in his impeachment, once in Georgia and once federally. The federal charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2024, due to the DOJ's policy of not prosecuting sitting presidents, subsequent to Trump's re-election that month.[7]\nBackground\nAttempts to overturn the 2020 election\nFor weeks prior to the impeachment, President Trump made numerous unsuccessful attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election.\nJanuary 6 U.S. Capitol attack\nTrump told his supporters to come to Washington, D.C. on January 6, the day Congress was counting the electoral votes, to the \"March to Save America\" rally at The Ellipse.[8] During the rally, Trump as well as other speakers falsely claimed that the election was stolen, used the word \"fight\", made an analogy to boxing,[9] and suggested that his supporters had the power to prevent President-elect Joe Biden from taking office.[10]\nWhen the United States Congress convened to certify the electoral votes of the presidential election, supporters of Trump crossed the Mall and stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to prevent the tabulation of votes and protest against Biden's win. Trump supporters illegally entered the Capitol and gathered on its eastern and western sides, including on the inaugural platform constructed for Biden's inauguration.[11] Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died from the riots, while several improvised explosive devices were found on and near the Capitol grounds.[12][13] Another Capitol police officer on duty during the riots died by suicide days later.[14] During the riots, Trump was \"initially pleased\" by the attack on the Capitol and took no action.[15][16] In a speech hours into the event, Trump told the rioters \"We love you. You're very special,\" restated his false claims of electoral fraud, and then asked them to go home.[17] Hours later, Congress reconvened and ultimately certified the electoral votes in the early morning hours of January 7. Trump then released a statement asserting that there would be an \"orderly transition\" of power on Inauguration Day, even while continuing to claim falsely that the election was stolen from him and also stat\nDoc 4(Title: Raffensperger, asking him to change the state's vote total by just enough votes for Trump to prevail by a single vote. \"There's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you've recalculated.\" NPR and others reported the call the next day.)

Spent coffee grounds can be used as a soil amendment and compost ingredient, while liquid coffee acts as an effective slug killer.) According to various sources, between 400 billion to 1 trillion cups of coffee are consumed around the world every year. No matter the number, that’s a lot of coffee, which means a lot of spent coffee grounds. Using coffee grounds in the garden keeps them out of the waste stream and gives gardeners another option for caring for plants and dealing with slugs.\nLinda Brewer, Oregon State University Extension Service soil scientist, said coffee grounds can be worked into the soil or added to a compost pile but should be done with some restraint.\n“The big message is that generally people are too enthusiastic,” Brewer said. “You really need to take the recommended dosages to heart. I’ve visited a site where a raised bed was ruined by too much coffee grounds. Like most kitchen waste, it is a fine amendment for the garden, but like anything else, coffee grounds can be overdone.”\nContrary to popular belief, it’s a myth that coffee grounds are acidic and will lower the pH of the soil. After brewing, the grounds are close to pH neutral, between 6.5 and 6.8. Research shows that whatever change coffee grounds bring to the soil is short-lived, Brewer said. So, don’t depend on them to keep a lower soil pH. Some plants like rhododendrons, azaleas, blueberries, gardenias and blue-flowering hydrangeas require a lower soil pH to thrive and coffee grounds won’t do that.\nFor more information about pH, see Extension publications “Acidifying Soil in Landscapes and Gardens East of the Cascades” and “Acidifying Soil for Blueberries and Ornamental Plants in Yard and Garden: West of the Cascade Mountain Range in Oregon and Washington.”\nAlthough coffee grounds provide some nitrogen (1% to 2%) and micronutrients, they aren’t a major source of plant nutrition, Brewer said. As coffee grounds break down, nitrogen is tied up by soil microorganisms using it to grow and reproduce. To adjust, add a nitrogen fertilizer or other source of nitrogen like composted animal manure, alfalfa meal or grass clippings when the uncomposted coffee grounds are incorporated.\nEven though coffee grounds provide minor amounts of potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium and very minor amounts of iron, copper, manganese and zinc, these nutrients aren’t supplied in sufficient quantity to satisfy plant needs. Coffee grounds are best at improving soil. As the coffee grounds feed the soil microbes, microbial glues are released that promote good soil structure and improve drainage.\nWhen using coffee grounds as a soil amendment, Brewer recommends working in a half inch to a depth of 4 inches. If used as a mulch on top of the soil, a layer of leaves or bark mulch helps keep the grounds from drying out and repelling water.\nWhen using grounds in the compost bin or pile, layer 3-parts leaves to 1-part fresh grass clippings to 1-part coffee grounds by volume. Coffee filters can be thrown in, too. Turn once a week and monitor for moisture and the compost will be ready in three to six months. The composition of the compost pile should not exceed 20% coffee grounds by volume, or it can be toxic to plants.\nExcess coffee grounds, if applied to the soil before composting, have multiple effects on the soil system. In addition to microorganisms tying up nitrogen temporarily, the caffeine residues in the spent coffee grounds can suppress germination and slow the growth of some plants.\nIf you get coffee grounds from coffee shops, you can store them tightly covered until ready for use. Mold may grow on the grounds, but these can be composted, where the mold will contribute to decomposition.\nPerhaps more exciting than the positive effect of coffee grounds as a compost and soil amendment, is its potential as a slug killer, Brewer said.

Numbers of slugs and snails have increased in broadacre cropping in Western Australia (WA) with the use of minimum tillage and stubble-retention practices. These systems increase the organic content of paddocks and soil moisture content, leading to higher survival levels of slugs and snails.\nSlug and snail pests in Australia have come from other countries, mainly in the Mediterranean region. They have similar lifecycles, which means similar management techniques can be employed to control them in broadacre crops.\nEffective management requires application of controls that coincide with different phases of the pest’s lifecycle. Each of the control measures outlined in this factsheet, if applied only by themselves, are unlikely to provide optimum control. An integrated approach needs to be considered to protect crops from damage by slugs and/or snails.\nNumber of Pages\n11\nKeywords\npest slugs, snails, broadacre crops, Western Australia, pest management\nDisciplines\nAgricultural Education | Biosecurity | Entomology\nRecommended Citation\nDepartment of Primary Industries and Regional Development, Western Australia.\n(2024), Pest slugs and snails and their management in broadacre crops.

Spent coffee grounds can enrich soil and compost, while brewed coffee itself can help manage slugs.) “The big message is that generally people are too enthusiastic. You really need to take the recommended dosages to heart. I’ve seen raised beds ruined by too much coffee.\"\nAn estimated 400 billion to 1 trillion cups of coffee are consumed worldwide each year. That’s a lot of grounds that might otherwise end up in the waste stream. Using coffee grounds in the garden keeps them out of landfills and gives gardeners another option for improving soil and controlling pests.\nLinda Brewer, a soil scientist with the Oregon State University Extension Service, said coffee grounds can be valuable for gardens and compost piles — if used in moderation.\n“The big message is that generally people are too enthusiastic,” Brewer said. “You really need to take the recommended dosages to heart. I’ve seen raised beds ruined by too much coffee. Like most kitchen waste, it’s a fine amendment, but coffee grounds can be overdone.”\nMyths about acidity\nIt’s a common misconception that coffee grounds are acidic. After brewing, they’re close to neutral — around pH 6.5 to 6.8. Any pH change in the soil is temporary, Brewer said.\nThat means coffee grounds won’t lower soil pH enough to benefit acid-loving plants such as rhododendrons, azaleas, blueberries, gardenias and blue-flowering hydrangeas.\nFor more on soil acidity, visit Acidifying soil in landscapes and gardens east of the Cascades and Acidifying soil for blueberries and ornamental plants in yard and garden: West of the Cascade Mountain Range in Oregon and Washington.\nCoffee grounds add structure, not major nutrients\nAlthough coffee grounds contain 1% to 2% nitrogen and small amounts of micronutrients, they aren’t a major source of plant nutrition. As the grounds break down, soil microorganisms temporarily tie up nitrogen while they grow and reproduce. To balance this, add a nitrogen-rich source such as composted manure, alfalfa meal or grass clippings when incorporating fresh coffee grounds.\nCoffee grounds contribute small amounts of potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium, and trace amounts of iron, copper, manganese and zinc. However, these aren’t sufficient to meet plant needs. The main benefit comes from improving soil structure and drainage. As soil microbes feed on the grounds, they release compounds that bind soil particles into stable, well-draining aggregates.\nHow to use coffee grounds in soil and compost\nWhen using coffee grounds as a soil amendment, Brewer recommends working in a half inch of grounds to a depth of 4 inches. If using as mulch, cover with leaves or bark mulch to prevent the surface from drying and repelling water.\nIn a compost pile, mix three parts leaves to one part fresh grass clippings to one part coffee grounds by volume. Coffee filters can be composted as well. Turn the pile weekly and monitor for moisture. The compost should be ready in three to six months. Coffee grounds should make up no more than 20% of the pile’s total volume — higher amounts can be toxic to plants.\nIf applied directly to soil before composting, excess coffee grounds can temporarily tie up nitrogen and may inhibit seed germination or slow plant growth due to caffeine residues.\nIf you collect grounds from coffee shops, store them in a sealed container until use. Mold may develop, but it’s harmless in compost and contributes to decomposition.\nCoffee as a natural slug control\nCoffee can also deter or kill slugs and snails. Brewer said research shows that a 1% to 2% caffeine solution used as a soil drench caused all slugs to leave treated soil and die of caffeine poisoning. A 2% solution applied to orchid growing media killed 95% of snails — outperforming a common slug bait containing metaldehyde.\nTo make a 1% to 2% soil drench, mix one part water with two parts strong brewed coffee. For foliar sprays, dilute furt\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the research provided, coffee grounds can indeed be effective as a slug and snail deterrent. A 1% to 2% solution of brewed coffee can be used as a soil drench, which causes slugs to leave the treated area and ultimately die from caffeine poisoning. This method is even more effective than common slug baits containing metaldehyde. Additionally, applying a diluted coffee solution as a foliar spray can also help deter slugs from feeding on plant leaves. However, it's important to use this method in moderation and follow recommended dosages to avoid negative effects on the soil and plants.",

    "question": "When I was a pre/teen, my mom insisted on watching me dress, then stared and made comments about my body. Was this sexual abuse?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, it is concerning that your mom insisted on watching you dress and making comments about your body. This behavior can be seen as inappropriate and possibly indicative of sexual abuse, especially if the comments were inappropriate or if the situation made you feel uncomfortable. However, without more specific details about the nature of the comments and the overall context, it's difficult to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nSexual abuse typically involves non-consensual sexual activities, inappropriate touching, or exploitation. If your mom's behavior involved any of these elements, it would be considered sexual abuse. However, if the comments were simply about your appearance and did not involve inappropriate touching or other sexual activities, it might be less clear-cut.\n\nIf you're unsure or feel uncomfortable, it's important to talk to someone you trust, such as a teacher, a healthcare provider, or a counselor. They can provide guidance and support based on the specific details of your situation.",

I did not know a safe place I could go to report child labor abuse…I feared if I went outside of the community to Child Protective Services I would be held accountable because I was his mother. I knew, as does every woman in the FLDS, that polygamy is an illegal lifestyle. We fear going to any service agencies outside our community because of the risk that we would get into trouble instead of being helped. We are all multi-generational Americans, but we have the same fears as any illegal immigrant . . . I did not believe I had the same constitutional rights as other Americans.6\nMary Gail Frawley-O’Dea, executive director of the Trauma Treatment Center and co-director of the Manhattan Institute for Psychoanalysis points out that “Secrecy is the acknowledged cornerstone of sexual abuse.” Many victims remain silent because “It is more hopeful for them to preserve a fantasy that if they tell, someone will protect them than it is to reveal the abuse to another who ignores, blames, or reabuses them.”7 Since secrecy is also the motto of polygamist communities, it is no surprise that sexual crimes so often go unaddressed. Were polygamists allowed to live their religion openly, they would be more likely to assimilate into mainstream American society where the perpetrators would not be so protected and their perversions not so easily concealed.\nDecriminalizing polygamy would also allow the government to use its resources more efficiently. In a 2008 congressional hearing, Brett L. Tolman, United States Attorney for the District of Utah, gave an overview of Utah’s efforts to prosecute polygamy, especially in pursuing Warren Jeffs, the leader of the FLDS who had been accused of (and later convicted of) sexual assaults on minors.\nSuch efforts have involved the full cooperation, coordination, and communication of multiple federal, State, and local agencies, including, but not limited to, the FBI in Utah, Nevada, and Dallas, Texas, the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, the Utah Attorney General’s Office, the United States Attorney’s Offices in Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and the Northern District of Texas, county authorities from Mohave County, Arizona and Washington County, Utah, and other federal agencies such as IRS Criminal Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives.8\nThe crimes committed by Jeffs are appalling, but one also shudders at the huge expenditures for this massive campaign. The 2008 raid on the FLDS’s Yearning for Zion ranch in Texas cost millions of dollars, which the state is trying to recoup by selling the FLDS ranch as property confiscated from a criminal enterprise. But it hasn’t found any buyers yet.\nThe reason for the raid was to look into suspected sexual abuse, but as Michelle Gibson from the Department of Women’s, Gender, and Sexual Studies at the University of Cincinnati gleaned from media coverage of the raid and the subsequent investigation, only 12 of the 400 children removed from the compound had actually been abused.9 Legal intervention needs to change its focus from the eradication of polygamy itself, which has been shown to be largely a cultural crusade, to the protection of the defenseless, which is an ethical responsibility.\nAnother crime connected with polygamy is welfare fraud. The BYU Journal of Public Law reviewed a welfare fraud case against polygamist Tom Green whose multiple wives were drawing welfare on the claim that they were single mothers. The review describes how Utah had dealt with a large number of cases where a woman was able to gain welfare benefits by claiming that she was a single mother simply by not marrying the man she was living with. This loophole was taken care of with the Common-law Marriage Statute, passed in February 1987. The law stipulates that a couple will be considered married if they are legally able to be married and if they have established themselves as husband and wife in society. Howe\nDoc 2(Title: s answer. Adults always respect a child’s “no”, and listen to other cues that may alert them that a child may not want to be touched (except in regards to medical or immediate safety concerns). Surprises are okay, but we don’t keep secrets. Only one person behind a closed bedroom/bathroom door, and we always knock before entering. Adults always keep children in a common area with other adults, and do not bring them to a secluded place. And whatever else you may find to be appropriate. Though these may seem basic for your older daughter, please tailor these to your family’s needs.) Again, I want to urge you to trust your gut here. It’s saying that something is off, and you are not feeling like you can trust your partner. If it doesn’t feel like he’s a safe person to bring around your children right now, then you have every right to limit his access to your kids, especially if you two live apart.\nCounseling\nAnother idea I want to mention is the option of getting your daughter involved with a therapist that she trusts – someone she can slowly build a relationship with and open up to as she’s ready. It sounds like, even without knowing whether he has sexually abused her, there is something she’s trying to express through her behaviors – something, clearly, is bothering her or stressing her out; she deserves an outlet for that. I’d encourage you to search for the therapist that is right for your daughter, as the right person (qualifications, personality, style) is key: this may mean talking to several to people on the phone, asking about their experience in the field and goals of treatment, and seeing if they align with what you’re looking for. The second or third person you meet may be the person that your daughter might really connect with. Our resource guide on Finding Professional Treatment and Support, her health insurance company, and a guidance counselor may all be places to turn to find a good referral – and while the times are changing, you may want to think about whether tele-visits may work right now too.\nSelf-Care\nAnd I also want to ask – how have you been doing? Do you have allies in this situation, and other people to lean on? This is really difficult, and you also deserve somewhere to process how you’re feeling. This is certainly a topic that you deserve somewhere to explore more deeply, to ensure that you’re able to take the best next steps for yourself and your family. Reach out to people in your life – friends, relatives, members of your faith community or seek out your own professional therapist. You should have somewhere to talk about how your boyfriend has been treating you, and all you’ve been seeing in your daughter – so that you can continue to make the best choices for yourself and your family.\nTake care,\nStop It Now!\nFeedback:\nPlease share your feedback on this question\nLast edited on: June 13th, 2024\nDoc 3(Title: ink, do you have other folks that share in your concerns? Like a friend or relative? You may want to share these tip sheets even. Looking over these warning signs sometimes helps a person put a finger on something they felt before but couldn’t put into words.) Identifying Harmful Patterns\nI also want to point out the unsafe dynamic you describe – when someone belittles you or calls you names to degrade you or lower your self-esteem – is emotional abuse. That is very worrisome that your boyfriend is now encouraging this same type of behavior in your daughter too. And, it sounds like the way he responded to you (by saying he was in the room the whole time when you couldn't find him) was gaslighting. Though you don’t describe physical violence, emotional abuse is still domestic violence, and you may still want to reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1.800.799.7233) to talk more about the life you share with your partner.\nHaving a Conversation\nIt sounds like you’ve had a conversation with your boyfriend, and it’s possible you may want to do so again – but I want to stress –only if it feels safe to have this talk and if there is someone else close to him or the both of you, maybe include that person as well. What you say doesn’t have to be accusatory or judgmental (or even confrontational), but it would be helpful to clearly state what behaviors you are seeing that are concerning and wait for him to respond; then draw the line on appropriate behavior. Children take cues from the important adults in their lives, and the way he talks to and behaves with your children will teach them what to expect from others and how they should be treated. And of course his comments about young girls is very worrisome. If talking to him further seems like a safe option, please check out our guidebook Let’s Talk. But again, safety must be your priority.\nWe also just did a webinar recently on a very similar topic called Dear Stop It Now! Helpline, I’m afraid my brother is grooming a child, and it may be helpful to you (and your allies) as you work towards next steps. This webinar dives deeper into having conversations with an adult with risky or abusive behaviors, and models a role play with two different outcomes. You can find a copy of the recording, role plays and handouts on the above link.\nSafety Planning\nNow would also be a great time to review your family safety plan, and perhaps get other caregiving adults involved with this too. Safety Planning articulates the guidelines about body boundaries, privacy, respect, and consent to your children, and asks other caregivers to model and respect these healthy boundaries too. This helps youth know what’s okay and helps them better recognize when something is not okay no matter where they are or who they are with. Having these guidelines in place can make it easier to discuss any unsafe behavior in the future by addressing the rule that has been broken, rather than by singling anyone out – these are rules that every adult and child must follow.\nSome families have rules like: Adults and children always play with our clothes on, with doors open, and we keep our hands to ourselves. The places we cover with a bathing suit are private. Unless you need help in the bathroom from your parents, or if you are at the doctor’s office getting a physical exam, no one should touch or see your genitals but you. If anyone is ever asking about your private parts, talking to you about theirs, or if anyone ever makes you feel uncomfortable or scared, it is important to speak up to a trusted adult. Adults and children always ask before giving a hug or kiss on the cheek first, and then they respect the other person’s answer. Adults always respect a child’s “no”, and listen to other cues that may alert them that a child may not want to be touched (except in regards to medical or immediate safety concerns). Surprises are okay, but we don’t keep secrets. Only one person behind a closed bedroom/bathroom door, and \nDoc 4(Title: ing, my dad beat me. Never correct me, showed me the correct way to do, just swiftly moved to punishing. Fists, belts, wooden spoons, 2×4, you name it, it was a weapon. My dad once choked me with a rope and all my mom could say “you are gonna kill her.” Didn’t stop him. To teach me a lesson to never lie again. I lied cause I was afraid of them. I have to tell you even when I got my period, my mom didn’t give me any privacy and asked me to lay down and she wiped my crotch for me. I was flipping 12 years old! I had no clue what a period was. In the Indian community, puberty and body changes aren’t discussed in healthy manner. You are shamed and embarrassed for changes you have no control over. I had no autonomy over my own body. My parents would tell me I was ungrateful, since they went to work all day, and I was not good enough. I have so many memories of being hit. Now, I am 45 years old. I am a mom and adore my daughter and I have never laid a hand on her. I broke the intergenerational trauma. My daughter now has a head start in life. A healthy, normal one. I was supposed to have an arranged marriage; after watching my dad hit my mom over the years, and I saw it in other marriages in my family as well. I went no way. The one thing I did right, was standing my ground, and refusing to marry whom they wanted me to marry. I married for love. I am happily married to the love of my life. He dotes on me and our daughter. He has never laid a hand on me or our daughter.) My mom died and now my dad is trying to guilt me into moving closer to him, to help take care of him. My brother went onto to become a meth addict and live a horrible life. He has my dad to thank for his addiction. One of the things my brother said to me in a psychosis was “do you know what it feels like to be in fourth grade, and your legs are trembling as you are walking home, cause you know you will get a beating for getting a low grade on your report card.” That came from a man who was 28 years old at that time. Fear destroys your soul. Now, my dad is saying garbage like “I fed you, clothed you, took you to school, etc.” My answer to that? Your kids don’t owe you for doing what parents are supposed to do. They are not indebted to you no matter the indoctrination you subject them to as children. Don’t have children if you are expecting a payout. Its funny to me; the man who never once hugged his children, said he loved them or showed them any affection, now wants love in his elderly years. To bad for him, I don’t know how to give it to him. Nor do I want to. I hope he dies a lonely man. I used to mourn my mom and didn’t know why. I now understand I clung to the one parent who showed me some kind of affection even if it was barely there. Children look for attachment to their caregivers, even if it an abusive one.\nI wish I could go back and have a re-do. Be a happy kid. But you learn the hard way, there are no re-dos. What matters now, is my daughter is free of the intergenerational abuse and trauma. That makes my heart soar.\nKibet\nApril 24th, 2023 at 4:21 AMWhy do you bear children that you know they are going to suffer,,,,why bear children to go through the pain that you went through,,,,why do parents make their children suffer he rest if their life,,,,and this is what i went through my parents have never loved never loved me ,,,and one of the painful moments that made me hate myself is that i finished my high school and i was supposed to go to university,,but my parents were so ignorant even my older brothers and sisters were not even bothered to take me to university,,,most of the time they say that even business is good ,,,,,,i can’t tell everything ,,, because my family members are so favoured alot ,,i really hate my parents alot especially my father who has been belittling me since as a young boy,,\nbajrang\nJuly 15th, 2023 at 8:49 AMi hate my parents because they bully me\nLeave a Comment\nBy commenting you acknowledge acceptance of GoodTherapy.org's Terms and Con\nDoc 5(Title:  anything.

The classic logic of blood is thicker than water, they did the best they could, etc. throws even more stumbling blocks onto the journey of recovery. In my instance, the situation was further complicated by sibling dynamics (a twin, middle child, with big age gaps). I’m pretty introspective and a well-adjusted person overall, but it wasn’t until the death of my father when I started to truly unpack my feelings. The death of my mother allowed me to repack them. It doesn’t mean I don’t occasionally catch myself standing in front of those boxes staring at the labels. Sometimes we realize we forgot to pack something away and have to go back and redo something. It takes continual effort to keep things straight. You won’t always find the validation you think you need, but logically moving through your experiences, thoughts and feelings (and perhaps writing them down) will get you well on the way. I like the part that mentioned the healthiest of people are the ones seeking treatment. I often felt I was the only one trying to clean up the toxicity in our family. I failed but I will survive.

These compromises also happen in everyday life, from seatbelt laws to food-safety regulations. A paper published in [_Perspectives on Psychological Science_](https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916211034499), however, suggests that restricting freedoms may have other unintended negative consequences for behavior and health. One of the authors, Nathan Cheek with Princeton University, explains how there may be a balance that can be achieved and how psychological science could help policymakers [promote public health](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/hero-epidemics-rt), safety, and well-being in times of crisis.\n\n_Auto-generated transcript_\n\n##### Charles Blue (00:12)\n\nThere is an often misstated and misunderstood quote by Benjamin Franklin, which reads, “Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither Liberty nor safety. Though often used rhetorically to denounce impositions or laws restricting certain behaviors, Franklin was actually referring to a specific tax dispute. This quote is therefore more accurately a pro-taxation and pro-defense spending statement than a quote supporting the absolute preservation of freedoms. During the Pandemic and other natural disasters, many actions are taken by governments to save lives at the cost of certain liberties. This is even in everyday life, from seatbelt laws to food safety regulations. The worthy objective of these restrictions is to protect people by imposing limits on what they are free to do. A new article published in _Perspectives on Psychological Science_, however, suggests there may be unintended consequences. Restricting freedoms may have negative consequences for behavior and health. This paper suggests that there is a balance that can be achieved and that psychology can help policymakers promote public health, safety, and well being when crises and disasters strike.

So my co-authors and I started having conversations about the many changes we were seeing in the wake of the Pandemic. So in the first few months, we saw dramatic world changes, extreme public policies that for many of us were relatively unprecedented, whether it was in the form of restrictions, social distancing requirements, work from home mandates, and many other things. And as these were unfolding, we were wondering what the psychological consequences would be of these dramatic changes. And then some early data coming out of Italy suggested that the psychology of freedom needed to be taken more seriously. And in fact, in a nationally representative sample of Italians, the most frequently reported new negative consequence of the lockdown was restricted freedom, even above things like financial burdens and social isolation. So clearly we need to be taking freedom seriously. As we were doing this work, we found that there were two broad clusters of negative consequences that seem to emerge when people face these kinds of new restrictions. The first is a cluster of mental and physical health consequences. It hurts to have freedom taken away, sometimes quite literally. And the second cluster was around negative behavioral responses ranging from things like noncompliance to more extreme manifestations of reactants in the form of, for example, public protest.\n\n##### Charles Blue (03:08)\n\nYour paper implies that there may be an imp\nDoc 2(Title:  a neutral arbiter, phrased in a resonant populism:\"It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes. Distinctions in society will always exist under every just government. Equality of talents, of education, or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions. In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics, and laborers--who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government. There are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses. If it would confine itself to equal protection, and, as Heaven does its rains, shower its favors alike on the high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be an unqualified blessing.\") Though some original Jackson men were flabbergasted and outraged at his turn against the Bank, the veto held up in Congress. It became the prime issue in the ensuing presidential campaign, with both sides distributing copies of Jackson's message. Jackson read his re-election as a mandate to pursue his attack on the Bank further.\nRemoval of the Deposits\nAs soon as the nullification crisis was resolved, Jackson took his next step. The Bank's open involvement in the presidential campaign convinced him more than ever of its inherent corruption. To draw its fangs until its charter ran out in 1836, he determined to withdraw the federal government's own deposits from the Bank and place them in selected state-chartered banks.\nThis was a maneuver requiring some delicacy. Under the charter, the secretary of the treasury, not the President, had authority to remove the deposits. He had also to explain his reasons to Congress, where the House of Representatives had just voted by a two-to-one margin that the deposits should stay where they were. Jackson canvassed his cabinet on removal. Most of them opposed it, but he got the support and arguments he needed from Attorney General Roger Taney. Jackson drew up a paper explaining his decision, read it to the cabinet, and ordered Treasury Secretary William John Duane to execute the removal. To Jackson's astonishment, Duane refused. He also refused to resign, so Jackson fired him and put Taney in his place. Taney ordered the removal, which was largely complete by the time Congress convened in December 1833.\nEven many congressional foes of the Bank could not countenance Jackson's proceedings against it. He had defied Congress's intent, rode roughshod over the treasury secretary's statutory control over the public purse, and removed the public funds from the lawfully authorized, responsible hands of the Bank of the United States to an untried, unregulated, and perhaps wholly irresponsible collection of state banks. To many, Jackson seemed to regard himself as above the law.\nFortunately for Jackson, Bank president Nicholas Biddle over-reacted and played into his hands. Regarding the removal of deposits as a declaration of open war, Biddle determined to force a recharter by creating a financial panic. Loss of the deposits required some curtailment of the Bank's loans, but Biddle carried the contraction further than was necessary in a deliberate effort to squeeze businessmen into demanding a recharter. This manipulation of credit for political ends served only to discredit the Bank and to vindicate Jackson's strictures against it.\nCongress did not even consider recharter, but it did lash out at Jackson. Clay men and Southern anti-tariffites could not agree on the American System; they could not all agree on rechartering the Bank; but they could unite in th\nDoc 3(Title: Freedom Versus Security: Can We Find the Right Balance?) \n going to do anything to me if I just leave it by where my car was parked. But I take the extra steps of bringing it back just because I know it’s like the right thing to do. So moral framework, at least for those of us who return our shopping cards, can be potentially powerful. The third principle is about reframing restrictions as freedom from so many of these public policies aimed at increasing security can be thought of as ways of increasing a different kind of freedom. They might be limiting your freedom to do whatever you want, but they might be increasing your freedom from threats. So, for example, you see this in the history of smoking bans in the United States. For a long time, smoking was thought of as an individual Liberty, and so attempts to ban smoking would be seen as a real restriction on what you’re free to do. But then the conversation shifted and became more about secondhand smoke and the danger of smoking posed to other people.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (07:09)\n\nAnd once it became a conversation about protecting others individual freedom from the threat of secondhand smoking or other kinds of security threats, then suddenly it became more defensible and more accepted to have these kinds of smoking bans. And so that kind of reframing can be really effective. And I think sometimes it’s so clear to us that we take it for granted. So you don’t see public protests around bans on Hasbro for using lead paint and children’s toys. And that’s because it’s so clear to us that we want children to be free from that kind of threat. So it’s just about understanding new policies through that same kind of light that we often accept. And then the final principle, encouraging freedom other ways Is about finding new outlets for people to exercise freedom. So as you’re losing some perceived freedoms to gain security, Maybe there are other ways either at the individual level or the more structural, collective level that you can see ways to increase your freedom as well. So I think when many of us adopted new habits like becoming obsessed with baking sourdough, that was a way of exercising agency, Taking on something new.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (08:12)\n\nIt was probably about passing the time, But I think also just exercising this freedom of choice. And then I think there’s a lot of room for policy makers to facilitate that kind of thing. A couple of examples would just be putting more funding towards resources like online libraries and Museum tours in ways that allow us to virtually explore the world as well as amenities like public parks and hiking trails Where we can get out of the world, exercise our freedom Even as we’re also under many restrictions.\n\n##### Charles Blue (08:39)\n\nI want to go back to something you said earlier. And it struck me that you said that the loss of freedom hurts almost as if it’s a physical injury or damage that a person suffers when they were real or not feel they have given up a type of freedom. Could you explain that a little bit more? What do you mean when someone is physically hurt by giving up a freedom?\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (09:01)\n\nYeah, so partly I’m invoking metaphor here, but in a sense, we do see a lot of research that connects people’s sense of autonomy to their physical wellbeing. And a lot of that work is under the umbrella of self determination theory which argues that a sense of autonomy, a free choice of freedom is one of the fundamental needs that all people have and that can look different across different cultural contexts. But all of us need to feel some kind of sense of agency or freedom to pursue what we want to do. And so when we have that freedom taken away, It causes mental pain and sometimes physical pain as we suffer the physical and mental health consequences of having that kind of restriction.\n\n##### Charles Blue (09:42)\n\nThis may not come under the umbrella of your research, but has there been anyone who’s looked into just \nDoc 4(Title: thoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement.

For this analysis, we surveyed 8,709 adults – including 7,166 registered voters – from April 8 to April 14, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.) Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, American voters face a similar set of choices as they did four years ago – and many are not happy about it.\nWith the election still more than six months away, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that the presidential race is virtually tied: 49% of registered voters favor Donald Trump or lean toward voting for him, while 48% support or lean toward Joe Biden.\nA defining characteristic of the contest is that voters overall have little confidence in either candidate across a range of key traits, including fitness for office, personal ethics and respect for democratic values.\nWhere Trump has the advantage: More than a third of voters say they are extremely or very confident that Trump has the physical fitness (36%) and mental fitness (38%) needed to do the job of president.\nFar fewer say the same of Biden (15% are at least very confident in his physical fitness; 21% are extremely or very confident in his mental fitness). Majorities say they are not too or not at all confident in Biden’s physical and mental fitness.\nWhere Biden has the advantage: More voters are extremely or very confident in Biden (34%) than in Trump (26%) to act ethically in office. And while 38% say they are at least very confident in Biden to respect the country’s democratic values, fewer (34%) express that level of confidence in Trump. The survey was conducted before the start of Trump’s “hush money” trial in New York City.\n(Read more about voters’ views of Biden and Trump in Chapter 2.)\nThe state of the 2024 presidential race\nThe new Center survey of 8,709 adults – including 7,166 registered voters – conducted April 8-14, 2024, finds large divides in voters’ candidate preference by age, education, and race and ethnicity. As was the case in 2020, younger voters and those with a four-year college degree are more likely to favor Biden than Trump.\nOlder voters and those with no college degree favor Trump by large margins.\nAmong racial and ethnic groups:\n- White voters favor Trump (56%) over Biden (42%) by a wide margin.\n- Roughly three-quarters of Black voters (77%) support Biden, while 18% back Trump.\n- Hispanic voters are more evenly divided – 52% favor Biden, while 44% back Trump.\n- Asian voters favor Biden (59%) over Trump (36%).\n(Read more about voters’ candidate preferences in Chapter 1.)\nMost voters who turned out in 2020 favor the same candidate in 2024.

Registered voters who did not vote in 2020 are about evenly divided: 48% back Trump, while 46% support Biden.\nA majority of voters say “it really matters who wins” the 2024 race. Today, 69% of voters say it really matters which candidate wins the presidential contest this November.

The three richest men in America attended Trump's second inauguration, and Elon Musk's formation of DOGE, as well as the enactment of Project 2025, were seen as myopic and unconstitutional, featuring policies such as reducing taxes on corporations and capital gains, instituting a flat income tax on individuals,[462] cutting Medicare and Medicaid,[463][464] reversing President Joe Biden's policies, and reducing environmental protections.[465][466] After Trump won the election, Sanders released a statement blaming the Democratic Party's abandonment of \"working-class people\" for its defeat.[467] In February 2025, Sanders began the \"Fighting Oligarchy Tour\", in which he and Ocasio-Cortez held rallies criticizing Trump's policies and economic inequality.[468][469] In April 2025, Sanders criticized the administration, saying that its moving \"rapidly toward oligarchy\", he also called US a \"pseudo-democracy\".[470]\nAt one rally held in June 2025, Sanders reacted to news of Trump's bombing of Iranian nuclear sites by saying: \"The American people are being lied to again today.

Austin III on the President's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget\n\n\"The FY 2024 budget is the most strategy-driven request we've ever produced from the Department of Defense. And as our National Defense Strategy makes clear, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is our pacing challenge. This budget seeks to meet this critical challenge today, tomorrow, and into the future by providing the resources today to continue to implement our National Defense Strategy and keep our nation safe while delivering a combat credible Joint Force that is the most lethal, resilient, agile, and responsive in the world.\n\nAs the PRC races to modernize its military, this budget will sharpen our edge by making critical investments across all timeframes, theaters, and domains. Among numerous important actions that bolster our combat credibility in the short term, this budget makes the Department's largest-ever investments in readiness and procurement – and our largest investment in research and development.\n\nTo sustain our military advantage over China, it makes major investments in integrated air and missile defenses and operational energy efficiency, as well as in our air dominance, our maritime dominance, and in munitions, including hypersonics. This budget includes the largest ever request for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which we are using to invest in advanced capabilities, new operational concepts, and more resilient force posture in the Indo-Pacific region. It also enables groundbreaking posture initiatives in Guam, Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Japan, and Australia.\n\nWe are also investing in resiliency in key parts of the defense supply chain to ensure stability in the industrial base's ability to produce what the Joint Force needs. That includes working closely with Congress to secure multi-year procurement authorities—and allow us to meet the needs of tomorrow. And this year's budget also increases funding to continue modernizing all three legs of our nuclear triad to maintain a safe, secure, and effective strategic deterrent against advanced and persistent threats around the world.\n\nThe United States has the strongest military in the world because we have the best team in the world. And we owe it to the brave men and women who serve to take care of our people and their families. So this budget includes the largest military and civilian pay raise in decades, and it builds on progress we've already made to make life a little easier by lowering every day costs, including by reducing the cost of goods in the commissary and making childcare more accessible and affordable.\n\nAs the Secretary of Defense, my priority will always be to ensure that our forces are ready and resilient, and that our military remains the world's preeminent fighting force, today, tomorrow, and for generations to come. I look forward to working with Congress to support the President's request.\"\n\nOn March 9, 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration submitted to Congress a proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget request of $842 billion for the Department of Defense (DoD), an increase of $26 billion over FY 2023 levels and $100 billion more than FY 2022. The FY 2024 Defense Budget is driven by strategy and provides us with the capabilities and investments to advance the Secretary's three key priorities: defending the nation, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork.\n\nTo achieve these priorities, this budget request links strategy to resources to continue executing our 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), which aligns with the President's National Security Strategy. These guiding documents determine the vision and direction of the Department of Defense in what the President has called the \"decisive decade.\" The NDS outlines the Department's defense and security priorities:\n\n*   Defending the homeland, paced to the growing multi-domain threat pos\nDoc 5(Title: aid this in April 2020 about that year’s election (74%). Nearly identical shares of Biden’s and Trump’s supporters say the outcome of the presidential race really matters.) About half of voters would replace both Biden and Trump on the 2024 ballot\nReflecting their dissatisfaction with the Biden-Trump matchup, nearly half of registered voters (49%) say that, if they had the ability to decide the major party candidates for the 2024 election, they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot.\nBiden’s supporters are especially likely to say they would replace both candidates if they had the chance. Roughly six-in-ten (62%) express this view, compared with 35% of Trump supporters.\nThere also are stark age differences in these views: 66% of voters under 30 say they would replace both candidates if they had the chance, compared with 54% of those ages 30 to 49 and fewer than half (43%) of those 50 and older.\n(Read more about voters’ feelings toward the upcoming election in Chapter 3.)\nEvaluations of the Biden and Trump presidencies\n- 42% of voters overall say Trump was a good or great president, while 11% say he was average. This is a modest improvement since March 2021, two months after he left office.\n- 28% of voters say Biden is a good or great president, while 21% say he is average. These views are mostly on par with June 2020 assessments of the kind of president Biden would be – but today, a smaller share of voters say he is average.\n(Read more about ratings of Biden’s and Trump’s presidencies in Chapter 1.)\nOther findings: Biden’s job approval ticks up, Trump’s election-related criminal charges\n- Biden’s approval among the general public: Today, Biden’s approval rating sits at 35% – roughly on par with his rating in January (33%). His job rating has climbed slightly among Democrats over that period, however. Today, 65% of Democrats approve of him – up 4 percentage points since January. (Read more about Biden’s approval rating in Chapter 4.)\n- Conceding the presidential election: A majority of voters say it is important that the losing candidate in November publicly acknowledge the winner as the legitimate president.

The fossil fuel lobby group Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) and its affiliated oil and gas operators—which include BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil, and TotalEnergies—[strategically leveraged](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2023/10/cold-homes-hot-profits) privileged access to exert influence on legislation. Replicating Italian oil company Eni’s [strategy to capitalize](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eni-can-supply-more-gas-help-reduce-russia-reliance-2022-03-18/) on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, OEUK representatives [met with ministers](https://www.desmog.com/2023/10/24/revealed-the-oil-and-gas-lobbying-campaign-to-water-down-windfall-tax/) more than 200 times to lobby against the United Kingdom’s windfall tax proposal to put a levy on oil and gas producers.\n\nIn some cases, this manipulation even extends into multilateral spaces. World climate leaders and activists—with the United States [notably absent](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/16/cop28-john-kerry-backs-uae-appointment-oil-chief)—[voiced concerns](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/cop28-uae-sparks-backlash-by-appointing-oil-chief-as-president.html) over the UAE hosting the annual UNFCCC COP28 and [appointing the CEO](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/07/meet-the-oil-man-tasked-with-saving-the-planet-cop28) of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company as the COP28 president. Days before COP28 commenced in Dubai, however, [leaked documents indicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67508331) that the UAE was using its presidency to seek lucrative oil and gas deals with a range of government officials. If true, this would show an unprecedented industry capture of the multilateral climate space, directly undermining global climate progress at a time when scientists warn that the [window to reach Paris Agreement goals is closing](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/time-running-out-defuse-climate-time-bomb).\n\nIn all of these cases, the industry’s anti-democratic strategy is clear: manipulate the levers of power to obstruct any climate policies that may reduce the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, even—or especially—when the public supports those policies.\n\n##### Read more\n\n* * *\n\n### Tactic 3: Directly undermine democratic functions and freedoms\n\nWhile polluting public discourse and manipulating governments represent indirect attacks on democratic systems, the fossil fuel industry and its allies further strengthen their influence by directly undermining the fundamental rights at the heart of free societies. They do this in three main ways: 1) by filing expensive, protracted [strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs)](https://earthjustice.org/experts/coby-dolan/its-time-to-end-strategic-lawsuits-against-public-participation-slapp); 2) by pushing anti-protest legislation; and 3) by promoting voter suppression policies.\n\nIn response to the 2016 Standing Rock protests in the United States, Dakota Access Pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners [filed](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/22/545310247/dakota-access-pipeline-owner-sues-greenpeace-for-criminal-activity) a [SLAPP](https://earthjustice.org/experts/coby-dolan/its-time-to-end-strategic-lawsuits-against-public-participation-slapp) against protesters to prevent similar demonstrations from spreading.

Two CRI executives manage ACOP’s [Ocean Environment Legal Defense Fund](https://oceanlegaldefense.org/), the goal of which is to create a permanent offshore wind exclusion zone. However, with many of these groups also [supporting offshore oil drilling](https://theintercept.com/2021/12/08/oil-industry-wind-farm-prevent/), their opposition to wind farms seems intended simply to slow down progress on this renewable competitor to fossil fuels.\n\nThe oil and gas industry’s public influence methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated as they [hire major public relations firms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/climate/fti-consulting.html) to promote their false narratives and generate astroturf groups.\n\n##### Learn more about offshore wind\n\n* * *\n\nFossil fuel companies and trade groups promote climate obstruction through additional indirect methods, including by [funding think tanks](https://www.desmog.com/heartland-institute/) and [political candidates](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/climate-deniers-117th-congress/) who deny the reality of climate change. By casting doubt on climate science and portraying a false picture of scientific debate—even though oil and gas companies have [internally known](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/oversight-committee-releases-new-documents-showing-big-oil-s-greenwashing#:~:text=The%20Committee's%20investigation%20found%3A,to%20transition%20to%20clean%20energy) about the [climate threat](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-53640382) for [decades](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/)—these companies delay meaningful climate action.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry’s influence campaigns do more than simply mislead the public about climate change and oil and gas companies’ ostensible efforts to fight it; they also foment extreme false beliefs on the issue. For example, the industry promotes fabricated narratives such as warnings that proponents of climate action are [supposedly threatening to destroy individual liberty](https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/climate-is-the-new-front-in-the-culture-wars/) with a “climate lockdown.” Such rhetoric serves to hyperpolarize the issue of climate change into another front in the culture wars, undermining societies’ ability to reach productive, democratic consensus both [in the United States](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/05/1203893268/climate-change-conspiracies-disinformation) and [abroad](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/08/20/weaponising-the-climate-crisis-how-extremists-and-politicians-are-polarising-the-debate).

    "question": "Can sugar cause hyperactivity in children?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the provided information, the scientific consensus is that there is no direct evidence to support the claim that sugar causes hyperactivity in children. The myth of sugar causing hyperactivity is largely based on a single study from the 1970s and subsequent smaller studies that did not replicate the initial findings. Larger studies have failed to show a consistent link between sugar consumption and hyperactivity. However, some studies suggest that children with ADHD might be more sensitive to sugar, and there is a psychological aspect where parents perceive their children as more hyperactive when they think they have consumed sugar.\n\nAdditionally, excessive sugar consumption can lead to other health issues such as obesity, which can contribute to hyperactivity due to poor sleep patterns and overall health. Therefore, while sugar itself is not directly linked to hyperactivity, its consumption should be moderated for overall health benefits.\n\n<answer> No, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that sugar causes hyperactivity in children. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> I need to check the current scientific consensus on whether sugar causes hyperactivity in children. </think>\n<search> \"sugar and hyperactivity in children\" </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Round up a group of kids for a party, give them some cake and soda, and before you know it they’ll be bouncing off the walls, right? Not exactly. While many parents swear that sugar makes their kids hyperactive, a substantial body of research shows there’s no link between the two.) The Sweet Truth\nThe sugar-hyperactivity myth is based on a single study from the mid 1970s, in which a doctor removed the sugar from one child's diet and that child's behavior improved. Since then, dozens of larger studies have been conducted without proving sugar causes hyperactivity. However, some studies indicate that children who have attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be more sensitive to sugar.\nInterestingly enough, researchers have found that parents are more likely to say that their kids are overly active when they think they've consumed sugar. Some studies have asked parents to rate their child's hyperactivity after drinking a beverage with sugar. Unknown to the parents, the drink was sugar-free, but the parents still rated their child as more hyperactive.\nGuilty By Association?\nYou may think your child is acting out during their birthday party because of the sweet snacks being eaten, but your child may be wired because of the excitement of playing games and being with friends.

Not exactly. While many parents swear that sugar makes their kids hyperactive, a substantial body of research shows there’s no link between the two.) The Sweet Truth\nThe sugar-hyperactivity myth is based on a single study from the mid 1970s, in which a doctor removed the sugar from one child's diet and that child's behavior improved. Since then, dozens of larger studies have been conducted without proving sugar causes hyperactivity. However, some studies indicate that children who have attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be more sensitive to sugar.\nInterestingly enough, researchers have found that parents are more likely to say that their kids are overly active when they think they've consumed sugar. Some studies have asked parents to rate their child's hyperactivity after drinking a beverage with sugar. Unknown to the parents, the drink was sugar-free, but the parents still rated their child as more hyperactive.\nGuilty By Association?\nYou may think your child is acting out during their birthday party because of the sweet snacks being eaten, but your child may be wired because of the excitement of playing games and being with friends.

While the belief that sugar causes hyperactivity in children is widespread and perpetuated by the children themselves, it’s a myth, according to Sabiha Kanchwala, MD, general pediatrics specialist at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital.) The popularized Feingold diet, which eliminated food additives, brought sugar under close scrutiny in the 1970s. But some years later in the 1980s, the Feingold diet came under the same scrutiny, and multiple contradicting studies were established. The findings concluded sugar has no influence on children’s behavior.\n“We’re almost 40 years later, and people still think sugars make their kids really active or hyperactive,” Kanchwala says.\nExpectation and perception\nKanchwala says a large part of this myth comes from the power of our own minds. If we go into a situation expecting a certain outcome, we will likely see that outcome. It’s a placebo effect.\n“Even children know the power of their brains. They say, ‘I ate all this candy, I’m never going to go to sleep!’” Kanchwala says. “We know sugar in and of itself is not what’s making your child hyper, but there are a variety of other things leading to their excessive activity.”\nMost often, hyperactivity in children results from poor sleep. Kanchwala recommends following careful sleep hygiene to ensure your child sleeps enough. Turn off electronics well before bedtime, create a sleep conducive environment, follow a bedtime routine (including time), and make sure your child gets anywhere from 10-12 hours a night for school-aged children, and 8-10 hours a night for teenagers. Getting enough exercise during the day also helps children sleep.\n“Adults are more tired and somnolent throughout the day when they’re not getting good sleep; kids can be really hyper,” Kanchwala says. “One of the biggest factors for patient’s hyperactivity is lack of sleep.”\nA chronic condition can also cause hyper behavior, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Kanchwala says these kids’ behavior can look like hyperactivity when it’s not. If you believe your child struggles with a such a condition, speak to your pediatrician about an evaluation right away, particularly for school-aged children.\nOther factors include stress, trauma, or caffeine. Some candies, such as chocolate, contain caffeine and create a supposed ‘sugar rush.’ Caffeine can prevent drowsiness, cause restlessness, increase heart rate, and cause other side effects. It’s possible your child’s behavior matches up with caffeine intake.\nIt’s important to remember that children are children, and what a parent interprets as hyperactivity may be the natural, healthy energy of young life. Delve into the source of your child’s hyperactivity. Consider when and where your child’s hyperactivity blooms, if their hyperactivity corresponds with their sleep, or if another kind of behavioral health issue might play a role.\nSugar’s actual effect\nSugar itself may not make your child hyper, but it does affect your child’s health and future. Kanchwala says processed sugar intake leads to obesity in childhood. This major health problem results in both childhood and adulthood health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, liver disease, and even mental health conditions.\nProcessed sugar often shows up on labels of overall unhealthy foods — fast, processed foods that make easy grab-and-go snacks for a busy household.\n“Unfortunately, foods readily available are going to have added sugars that make it taste better and last longer,” Kanchwala says. “Parents should be mindful of the foods children eat that contain this processed sugar.”\nThe more unprocessed the diet, the healthier for the child, says Kanchwala. She recommends avoiding juice and other sugary snacks such as fruit gummies and replacing them with foods containing naturally occurring sugars. For\nDoc 5(Title: Abstract) This study investigated the correlation between consumption of sugar intake by fifth grade students in primary schools and development of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). A total of 107 students participated, and eight boys and one girl (8.4% of the total) categorized as high risk for ADHD according to diagnostic criteria. There were significant differences in the occupations and drinking habits of the respondents' fathers between the normal group and risk group. In a comparison of students' nutrition intake status with daily nutrition intake standards for Koreans, students consumed twice as much protein as the recommended level, whereas their calcium intake was only 60% of the recommended DRI (dietary reference intake). Regarding intake volume of vitamin C, the normal group posted 143.9% of the recommended DRI, whereas the risk group showed only 65.5% of the recommended DRI. In terms of simple sugar intake from snacks, students in the normal group consumed 58.4 g while the risk group consumed 50.2 g. These levels constituted 12.5% of their total daily volume of sugar intake from snacks, which is higher than the 10% standard recommended by the WHO. In conclusion, children who consumed less sugar from fruit snacks or whose vitamin C intake was less than RI was at increased risks for ADHD (P < 0.05). However, no significant association was observed between total volume of simple sugar intake from snacks and ADHD development.\nKeywords: ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), sugar consumption, dietary behavior\nIntroduction\nBalanced nutrition is very important during childhood, which is a period of vigorous growth, increased activity, and development of body functions and social cognitive ability. With rapid economic growth and increased personal income, and especially advances in food processing and manufacturing industries, the proportion of processed foods (e.g. snacks and cakes) in children's dietary life has noticeably increased [1-2]. It has also led to larger physiques of pre-adolescent children.\nRecently, the interest in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during childhood has increased. ADHD is defined as a neurobehavioral developmental disorder characterized by continuous inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness and is especially prevalent in childhood [3-4]. Unlike those showing simple hyperactivity features, children with ADHD have three subtype symptoms: predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, predominantly inattentive, and combined hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive [5-7]. The Conner Abbreviated Teacher Rating Scale (CATRS) is widely used to specifically measure the mental pathology behavior of children with ADHD [8]. The etiology of ADHD involves genetic, dietary, and environmental factors. Especially, dietary factors such as color agents or simple sugar have been determined to increase the risk of ADHD [6,9].\nSimple sugar consumption may cause hyperactivity, given that snacks containing high sugar content cause massive secretion of insulin from the pancreas, resulting in hypoglycemia [9]. This stimulates an increase in epinephrine, leading to activation of nervous reactions and hyperactivity disorder behaviors [9]. In other words, elevated intake of snacks might increase the potential of nutritional imbalance, lower emotional intelligence [10-11], and ADHD [12-14]. A recent study on sugar consumption suggested that higher consumption of sugar is positively correlated with a higher level of hyperactivity and attention deficiency similar to ADHD [1,9,11,15]. However, it is still controversial whether or not there is an association between ADHD and sugar consumption. A study by Wolraich et al. found that diets high in sucrose had no significant effects on behavior and cognitive performance in children [16]. Moreover, in Korea, there are little data on how much simple sugar children obtain from snacks or if higher consumption of simple sugar is associated with ADHD ris\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the provided information, the scientific consensus is that there is no direct evidence to support the claim that sugar causes hyperactivity in children. The myth of sugar causing hyperactivity is largely based on a single study from the 1970s and subsequent smaller studies that did not replicate the initial findings. Larger studies have failed to show a consistent link between sugar consumption and hyperactivity. However, some studies suggest that children with ADHD might be more sensitive to sugar, and there is a psychological aspect where parents perceive their children as more hyperactive when they think they have consumed sugar.\n\nAdditionally, excessive sugar consumption can lead to other health issues such as obesity, which can contribute to hyperactivity due to poor sleep patterns and overall health. Therefore, while sugar itself is not directly linked to hyperactivity, its consumption should be moderated for overall health benefits.\n\n<answer> No, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that sugar causes hyperactivity in children. </answer>",

    "agent_answer": "From the documents provided, it is evident that Donald Trump's past behavior and remarks have had a significant impact on how women perceive him. Many women found his statements and actions towards women to be offensive and disrespectful. The 2016 election saw a notable divide among women voters, with a larger percentage of Clinton voters finding the sexual assault allegations credible compared to Trump voters.\n\nHowever, the 2016 election occurred under different circumstances, and there have been changes since then. Women's attitudes can evolve over time, especially regarding political figures. Some women might still support Trump due to his policies, economic stance, or other factors unrelated to his past behavior. Therefore, it is possible that a portion of women could still vote for Donald Trump in a future election, but the extent of this support would likely be less than in previous elections.",

She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter that this is the first time a major party is picking a woman to be its nominee?

Donate now By — Josh Lederman, Associated Press Josh Lederman, Associated Press By — Erica Werner, Associated Press Erica Werner, Associated Press) CLEVELAND — Liar. Garbage. Lock her up. Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean tow\nDoc 4(Title: Election 2016) The hidden sexism that could sway the election\nBy Daniel Bush\nPhotography by Greg Neiser and Kevin Kopanski\nDesign by Megan Crigger and Vanessa Dennis\nEdited by Jenny Marder and Travis Daub\nArmando Manno was in a good mood. His bartending shift at Louie's Bar & Grill in Akron, Ohio was almost over, and the Cleveland Cavaliers were ahead in the first quarter of a pivotal playoff game. It was May 25, near the end of the primary season, and talk had shifted to the presidential election. “Trump is going to make the right moves,” Manno, the son of Italian immigrants and a lifelong Republican, said as he wiped down the bar. “You don’t become a gazillionaire if you don’t know what you’re doing. He’s gotta have something upstairs.” As for Hillary Clinton, Manno said that he didn't want her in the White House. She was untrustworthy and willing to say anything to get elected, he said. And she possessed another, more fundamental shortcoming, Manno added: her gender. “Nothing against women,\" he said, \"but I don’t want a woman president right now.”\nManno laughed and gave a sheepish, that’s-just-how-I-feel shrug. As he turned away, a waitress named Mary Stone quietly offered a different point of view. Though she’s also planning to vote for Trump in the fall, Stone said she could relate to the cultural barriers that Clinton faces as a woman. “Men are still chauvinistic enough to think that women can’t do the same job as them. And I think that’s an issue.”\nHeading into the general election, Clinton has a wide lead over Donald Trump among minority and female voters. But Clinton, who made history last week as the first woman to clinch the nomination of a major U.S. party, has struggled with the one big voting bloc that’s truly up for grabs in 2016: moderate white men. White men also happen to be Trump’s base. If he doesn’t get a record number of them to turn out, it’s hard to see how he wins the presidency. Women, African-Americans, and Latinos will still play a crucial role in the race. They skew Democratic and anti-Trump. If Clinton keeps that coalition together, she can afford to lose some white men. But she can’t afford to lose too many.\nThe Clinton campaign knows this. Clinton spent significant time in the primaries courting white male voters — in particular white, mostly working-class men in the key Rust Belt and Midwestern swing states that usually decide presidential elections. And yet, despite all the effort, the results were abysmal. Clinton lost the overall male vote to Bernie Sanders by an average of 10 points in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin, according to an analysis of exit poll data. She also lost men by double-digits in states as varied as Nevada, Connecticut and Oklahoma. In contrast, she won the male vote by wide margins in states that have large numbers of African-American and Latino voters. In short, white men are the last holdout.\nBrian Brown, a registered Independent, on his motorcycle in downtown Canton, Ohio. Brown said that he thinks Hillary Clinton's gender will be an obstacle for some voters in the general election. \"There will be people who won’t vote for her because she’s a woman,\" Brown said. Right: The white male vote in Canton and other Rust Belt cities and towns will play a large role in the general election.\nFemale candidates have long faced more resistance, and received less support from men and women alike, even though the percentage of people who say they feel comfortable voting for women has gone steadily up. In 1937, just 33 percent of Americans said they would vote for a female presidential candidate, according to Gallup's first poll on the subject. By 2015, that number had climbed to 92 percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.\nObviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voter\nDoc 5(Title: co.

Currently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the popular vote nationally. For example, in this last election a Republican elector from Ohio would have to vote for Hillary Clinton because she won the popular vote nationally. A provision of the law is that it only takes effect when states comprising 270 electoral votes – a majority – all pass it. That’s nowhere close yet. Twelve states have passed this law. Connecticut had it before the legislature three or four years ago and it did not work its way through, but there is support for it here.\nShould there be electors in some states that change their vote on Dec. 19 and go against how they are supposed to vote, and the election results change, how could that be dealt with?\nBefore the Republican convention there was a lot of discussion of delegates not voting for Donald Trump. That didn’t happen. I don’t think it’s going to happen this time. If it did, it would be the kind of issue that makes your head explode. There would be an affirmation of the popular vote but it would be people voting not according to the way the people in their state dictated that they should vote. As noted, there have been faithless electors over time, but it’s never shaped the outcome of an election. This time around it would be, as Donald Trump would say, huge.\nWe advocate to other nations as they are moving toward democracy to let the people decide their elected representatives, but the people don’t really decide here if the winner of the popular vote doesn’t win. How do we as nation reconcile that?\nMost democracies are parliamentary systems, not a three branch system such as we have. It has not been uncommon in Great Britain, for example, for one party to get more aggregate votes for its parliamentary delegation, yet the other party gets more seats. We’re not unique in that regard. Secondly, we are a federal system, and the Electoral College is one of the things that makes federalism real. If you think federalism is a good thing, then you want to keep the Electoral College. Concurrent with the existence of the Electoral College, even with several occasions when the winner of the popular vote hasn’t won the election, advocates of the present system might say that the United States emerged as the most powerful and at times richest country in history. We defeated communism and fascism, we had some great political leaders and some duds as well. The Electoral College has not destroyed American democracy.\nYou served as a Connecticut elector in 2012. What was that experience like for you?\nIt was really just one of the rituals of American democracy. One of the electors was criticized in the early days of the republic because he had been chosen to vote as a Federalist but voted for the Jeffersonians. One of his critics said, “We employed you not to think, but to act.” I acted and cast my ballot, placing it in a box that was carved out of the original Charter Oak Tree used every four years only for this purpose. The ballots were already marked for Obama and Biden. There was not much discretion there. It seemed to me it was a symbolic way of affirming the ongoing nature of the Presidency. I didn’t have to think – just to act.\nDoc 2(Title: Yes, Democrats Have Called Some Elections Illegitimate.

NOTES ON CHANGE IN AMICUS PRACTICE:**\n\n**OR, THE SOFT STATISM OF REDUCING**\n\n**AMICUS BRIEFS TO 8000 WORDS**\n\nFirst off, a quick procedural comment or two:\n\nAmicus notes he has had, “for whatever reason”, a\n\nhiatus of some years since writing the Court. He also\n\nnotes that mysteriously, the rules have changed so\n\nthat the average amicus or amica—one who is not\n\npart of a state entity—is now limited to 8000 words,\n\ninstead of the 9000 he/she used to have. Amicus\n\nwonders if this new rationing of core legal and/or\n\npolitical (since law and politics overlap) speech is a\n\ngood idea.\n\n_Inter alia_, state entities, being large, established,\n\nand powerful, have plenty of ways of making\n\nthemselves heard. By contrast, it is, say, the small-\n\ntime country lawyer, writing her first and only brief\n\nto this Court, who may need all 9000 words to make\n\nimportant and complicated arguments to the Court.\n\nMaybe the government amici, not the “little people”,\n\nso to speak, should have been restricted to 8000\n\nwords, Thus, there is arguably a sort of statism, even\n\nif soft statism, in the new 8000-word wall. Perhaps\n\nthe Court can revisit its unnecessary speech-\n\nrationing at some point.\n\n5\n\n(Amicus is not “resentful” of the 8000-word limit;\n\nif he were, then, like Achilles sulking in his tent,\n\nHomer, _The Iliad_, he might have refused even to\n\nwrite this brief, or any amicus brief. But sulking\n\nmay achieve little, so here is Amicus, with his brief.)\n\n…True, some amici may be able to shoehorn their\n\nentire brief into, say, the length of a 17-syllable\n\n_haiku_. This is not always going to happen, though.\n\nEnough on that point for now: speaking of\n\nstatism, far more important forms of statism exist to\n\nbe criticized here, such as the deep state of\n\ncorruption created at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if\n\nthe President is deemed immune to criminal\n\nproceedings during his tenure in office.\n\n**II. NONACCOUNTABILITY FOR CRIMES**\n\n**MAKES THE PRESIDENT A ONE-MAN “DEEP**\n\n**STATE”, WHICH IS UN-AMERICAN**\n\nA theme or “meme” of recent decades, a “urban\n\nlegend” of sorts, has been the ““Deep State””, a\n\npossibly-legendary bunch of sneaky, shadowy D.C.\n\nbureaucrats running everything in secret. Whether\n\nthis umbrageous gang exists or not, what would be\n\neven worse, maybe, is if in open view, one member of\n\nour society is made into a temporary god, or idol, free\n\nfrom criminal investigation or prosecution. Such a\n\nparagon of lawlessness, a perfidious President\n\nbeyond his own society’s limitations, a Nietzschean\n\n“Superman” of sorts—“beyond good and evil”, at\n\nleast in his own troubled mind—, would be a one-\n\nperson “Deep State” incarnate: dark, untouchable,\n\nun-America\nDoc 4(Title: onvened and ultimately certified the electoral votes in the early morning hours of January 7. Trump then released a statement asserting that there would be an \"orderly transition\" of power on Inauguration Day, even while continuing to claim falsely that the election was stolen from him and also stating that he would not attend Biden's inauguration.[18]) Considered scenarios\nFour scenarios for the removal of Trump from office had been posited by members of Congress, members of Trump's cabinet, political commentators, or legal scholars: resignation, the invocation of the 14th Amendment, invocation of the 25th Amendment, or impeachment and conviction.\nResignation\nThe President of the United States can resign from office, in which case the Vice President will automatically become president, instead of merely assuming the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president. While Article II of the Constitution states that the \"Powers and Duties\" of the president devolve to the vice president in the event of the president's death, resignation, incapacity, or removal, John Tyler, the tenth president of the United States, interpreted that provision as allowing the Vice President to ascend to the presidency in such cases, without any qualifications. This practice was codified in 1967, with the passage of the 25th Amendment.\nIf Trump had resigned, Vice President Mike Pence would have become the 46th president of the United States; Pence would have been the shortest-serving president ever, being in office for a matter of days before handing power to Joe Biden as the 47th president on January 20. This would have surpassed the record of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days into his term. It would have been the second time in history that a president had been forced to resign; the first was the 1974 resignation of Richard Nixon when it appeared inevitable that he would be impeached and removed from office for his role in the Watergate scandal.\nDue to intense pressure on his administration, the threat of removal, and numerous resignations, Trump committed to an orderly transition of power in a televised speech on January 7.[19] In the White House on January 8, Trump mentioned that he was not considering resignation.[20] On January 9, The New York Times reported that Trump told White House aides that he regretted his statement committing to an orderly transition of power and that there was no chance he would resign from office.[21]\n14th Amendment\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is one of the Reconstruction Amendments. It addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law, and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. Section 3 states that a person who participated in insurrection after having taken an oath to support the Constitution is disqualified from holding future office unless permitted by Congress.\nIf Trump had been removed from office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, Pence would have become the 46th president of the United States, and he would still have been the shortest-serving president ever before handing power to Biden as the 47th president on January 20. It would also have been the first time that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment had been invoked since 1919 when it stopped Victor L. Berger, convicted of violating the Espionage Act for his anti-militarist views, from taking his seat in the House of Representatives.[22] It would also have been the first time that it had been invoked on a sitting president and its being invoked had been seen as especially unlikely.[23]\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the House Democrats who supported invoking the 14th Amendment against Trump. In a letter, Pelosi thanked her colleagues for their contributions to discussions on the 14th Amendment.[24] If successful, the former president would be ineligible for appointment to any federal office without a Senate supermajority vote in favor.\n25th \nDoc 5(Title:  day that President Trump’s so-called Commission on Election Integrity sent letters to all 50 states demanding intrusive and highly sensitive personal data about all registered voters.)

Russian-Ukrainian relations are seriously affected by such controversies. The range of conflict areas in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine is rather large -- the two nations have differences on ethnic, political, economic, territorial, and military issues. It has been especially difficult for many Russians to accept the secession of Ukraine. In imperial Russia, Ukraine was considered a sub-division of a larger Russia. The Bolsheviks rejected this idea and, through the Soviet era, officially acknowledged the existence of Ukraine as a separate East Slavic nation. At present, Russia has been trying to gain its role as the \"elder brother\" of Ukraine, while Ukraine, having gained formal political independence, wishes to establish its new identity. The search by both Russians and Ukrainians for their identities, and both Kiev's and Moscow's wishes to make as many political, economic, and military gains as possible from the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union, are the main characteristic features of the relationship between the two states. Due to the large set of conflict areas in bilateral relations, and having domestic instability and a lack of democratic institutions in both states, the Russian-Ukrainian disputes are likely to be long-term ones.\nIn 1992-93 the two most controversial issues in the Russian-Ukrainian relationship were the disputes over Ukraine's denuclearization, and provisions to Ukraine from Russia. Since early 1994, the division of the Black Sea Fleet and developments in Crimea have become the dominant (or, at least, very significant) aspects in Russian-Ukrainian relations. The Crimean peninsula has become an arena for the duel between Kiev and Moscow on political, economic, military, and territorial disputes. The upcoming Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between Russia and Ukraine was supposed to settle these disputes. However, it was decided by negotiating delegations led by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Evgyeniy Marchuk in October 1994 to give this treaty a status of a \"frame-work,\" leaving disputes over Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet unsettled. In this paper, I discuss the role and significance of the disputes over the Black Sea Fleet and Crimea within the context of Russian-Ukrainian relations.\nRussian-Ukrainian Relations: A General Outlook\nUkraine's Independence\nIn Kiev in November 1990, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk signed a friendship treaty in which Russia and Ukraine recognized each other as sovereign states. It was a tactical alliance between two provincial leaders, who were demonstrating their opposition to Gorbachev's rule and fostering the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In a referendum on December 1, 1991, more than 90 percent of the Ukrainian population voted for independence, and within a week, Yeltsin recognized Ukraine's independence unconditionally.\nSince \nDoc 4(Title: sals for autonomy. In September 1991, the Crimean parliament declared its sovereignty albeit as a constituent part of Ukraine. A slight majority (54 percent) of voters in Crimea supported Ukrainian independence in the December 1991 referendum.24) On May 5, 1992 the Crimean parliament declared its independence, and on May 6, 1992, it voted for a Constitution establishing the independence and providing dual citizenship with Russia for the Crimean population. Also, the Crimean parliament passed a resolution calling for a referendum on independence from Ukraine. The Verhovna Rada of Ukraine responded by declaring the independence declaration invalid. It instructed the Crimean parliament to reverse its decision and review some provisions of the Constitution, or face direct presidential rule from Kiev. At the same time, the Republican Movement of Crimea, a Russian-inspired organization, was very active in gathering the requisite number of signatures needed to hold a Crimean referendum on independence from Ukraine. The Kiev leadership, including chairman of the Crimean parliament Nikolay Bagrov, did their best to prevent escalation of the conflict. Their efforts resulted in a compromise between Kiev and Simferopol. Kiev made certain concessions, adopting the Act on Division of Powers Between Authorities of Ukraine and Republic of Crimea.\nThe Act has granted Crimea wide-ranging powers to determine its own foreign economic relations, as well as social and economic policies. It also proclaimed the peninsula an autonomous integral part of Ukraine, and stated that the territory can not be transferred to another state without the consent of both the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments. For its part, the Crimean parliament abandoned its claims for complete independence and dual citizenship. The revised Constitution of Crimea was adopted on September 25, 1992.\nThe dispute between Kiev and Simferppol was an encouraging signal for Russian officials, who were irritated by Ukraine's independence and its consequences, particularly Ukraine's stance on the division of the Black Sea Fleet. In January 1992, Vladimir Lukin, then chairman of the Russian parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, suggested that in order to pressure Ukraine to give up its claim to the Black Sea Fleet, Russia should question Ukrainian control over Crimea.25 This statement was followed by a resolution of the Russian Parliament to investigate the circumstances of Crimea's transfer from Russia to Ukraine in 1954. Finally, the Russian Parliament passed a resolution in May 1992 declaring the 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine illegal. In February 1993, the former Russian Vice-President Rutskoi stated that the International Court of Justice should decide whether Crimea belongs to Russia or Ukraine. This suggestion was supported by Russia's Ambassador to Ukraine, Leonid Smolyakov, who commented at a press conference in early 1993 that Russia had received 20,000 requests for Russian citizenship from Crimeans and that if Crimea should vote to become independent, the Russian government would support the move.26\nThe Era of Meshkov\nThe Strive For \"Crimea's Independence\" -- The Initial Stage\nIn early 1994, Crimea elected Yuri Meshkov as President. Meshkov, an ethnic Russian and former K.G.B. border guard, won overwhelming support from fellow ethnic Russians in a campaign managed by a reputed covert operative from Moscow. Meshkov's pro-Russian position and claims for Crimea's independence had complicated relations between Kiev and Simferopol, and between Kiev and Moscow. The first Crimean president expressed his views to reporters in mid-February 1994 as follows:\nThe main aspect of my policy is Crimea's independence. Independence alone will allow us to solve our economic problems.

Opening Russia's consulate in Simferopol, granting Russian citizenship to the Crimeans, setting up a special permanent mission of the Russian Parliament in the Crimean Parliament as well as the Crimean Parliament's representation in the Russian Parliament are being discussed in Moscow.52) The recent Chechen war has had certain implications for the Russia-Ukraine-Crimea triangle. From the very first days of Russia's military invasion in the Chechen Republic, the Ukrainian government has considered it an internal Russian affair. The Ukrainian leadership has presumed that recognizing Chechnya to be an integral part of the Russian Federation could facilitate Russia's recognition of Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine and lessen Russia's pressure over Crimean issues. However, there are certain doubts that Russia will meet Ukraine's expectations.\nRussia's invasion of Chechnya has been supported by some factions of the Crimean Parliament which have been trying to use the Chechen war in order to enhance their political prestige. In mid-January 1995, the \"Rossiya\" faction submitted a draft address to the Russian President and the Russian Parliament which stated, \"...actions against Dudayev can be considered a first step on the way of strengthening Russian statehood and (the) reunion of all Russian territories. It is time for Russia to put in order the situation in Sevastopol -- the main (Russian) Black Sea naval base, and in Crimea in general.\"53 Fortunately, this address lacked five votes to be adopted.\nThe issue of Crimea is likely to be a \"time bomb\" in Russian-Ukrainian relations. Anti-Ukrainian Russian extremists evoke nationalist sentiments in Crimea, while Ukrainian nationalists try to give political priority to the exaggerated \"Russian threat\" in Crimea. Crimean politicians could renew their claims for more independence from Kiev and ask Russia for protection. In such circumstances, the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia would suffer pressure from Defense Ministries and parliaments. High military officials in Kiev could call for preserving the territorial integrity of Ukraine by military means, and generals in Moscow could urge the Russian Army to protect Russians in Crimea. Deputies in both parliaments could use the dispute over Crimea in their political maneuvers and struggles for power.\nDivision of the Black Sea Fleet\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union and the emergence of the Newly Independent States (NIS) has brought about the problem of division of the Soviet military forces. The division of the ground and air forces of the former Soviet Union did not provoke serious controversies among the NIS. The division of the Soviet Navy, in general, was also quickly and easily resolved. The only unresolved issue in terms of the division of the former Soviet Armed Forces remains the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the fate of the Black Sea Fleet. The dispute involves military hardware -- six cruisers, 34 frigates and destroyers, 18 submarines, 106 small combat vessels, and 140 support and miscellaneous ships -- as well as large operating bases, mainly Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula.54\nChronology of the Dispute\nDebating the Idea of the Divisibility of the Black Sea Fleet\nAt the very early stage of the dispute, the Russian-Ukrainian rivalry was camouflaged by the idea of subordination of the Black Sea Fleet to the CIS Joint Armed Forces, as established by the Minsk Agreement on Strategic Forces of December 30, 1991; this legally-binding agreement defined all but ground forces as part of the strategic forces which were to be under unified CIS command. However, President Yeltsin's decree on March 16, 1992, creating a Russian Defense Ministry, was the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian dispute over t\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the documents provided, the international community does not uniformly recognize the annexation of Crimea by Russia, and there are differing viewpoints on its status.

    "agent_answer": "Based on the documents provided, it appears that corporate lobbying can indeed be seen as undermining democratic principles. The vast financial resources of corporations allow them to exert significant influence over government policies, sometimes at the expense of public interest and smaller stakeholders. This influence can extend beyond elections into the legislative and regulatory processes, where corporations can shape laws and regulations to their own advantage. Additionally, the increasing use of dark money and other opaque forms of political spending further complicates the ability of the public to understand and hold politicians accountable for their actions.\n\nWhile corporate lobbying can provide valuable expertise and information to policymakers, the potential for abuse is high, and it can lead to a perception of corruption and a lack of fairness in the democratic process. Therefore, it is crucial for governments to implement robust regulations to ensure transparency and prevent undue influence by corporations.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Corporate lobbying can be both a legitimate way for businesses to influence government policies and a mechanism that undermines democracy.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nCorporate lobbying involves businesses influencing government decisions through various means such as direct meetings with policymakers, providing expert advice, and funding research. This practice can be seen as a form of advocacy that allows businesses to voice their interests and concerns, which could lead to more balanced and informed policy-making.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that excessive or improper lobbying can undermine democratic principles. It might create an imbalance where powerful corporations have disproportionate influence over government decisions, potentially at the expense of public interest and smaller entities.\n\nTo get a clearer view on whether corporate lobbying is legitimate or problematic, I should look into how different countries regulate lobbying and the general consensus among political scientists.\n</think>\n\n<search> legitimacy of corporate lobbying in democratic societies </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Corporate Capture Threatens Democratic Government) \nacy—and how it is overwhelming American democracy. Sen. Whitehouse writes, “Corporate money is calling the tune in Congress; Congress is unwilling or unable to stand up to corporate power (indeed, Congress is often its agent).” These are truths that must be faced to be fixed.\n\nOur democratic society must demonstrate its resilience and return to core American principles and values of government that serve the people. We have the power to demand that Congress break the nexus between Wall Street and Washington that keeps the rules of our economy rigged to benefit the wealthiest few at the expense of the many. Americans can resist the slide to secret political spending and require disclosure for the big money interests behind our toxic politics of personal destruction. We can demand that lobbyists be prohibited from acting as fundraisers. And, amidst the shocking scandal of Russian interference in America’s democracy, we can insist that Congress ban foreign corporate money in elections.\n\nLet us harbor no illusions—this battle won’t be easy, but that doesn’t mean it is impossible. Ever since our founding as a republic, Americans have fought to expand democratic freedoms and protect democratic society from being corrupted through unchecked private greed and undermined through grotesque inequality. One can clearly see the result of corporate power over policy in the present levels of wealth inequality—unmatched since the Great Depression—where all the economic gains in the past several years accrued to the [wealthiest](https://thinkprogress.org/the-1-percent-have-gotten-all-the-income-gains-from-the-recovery-6bee14aab1) 1 percent. But as Economist Thomas Piketty concluded his study of economic inequality in _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_ by writing, “If we are to regain control of capitalism, we must bet everything on democracy.”\n\nFor democracy to work, the rules must be rewritten to prevent corporate capture of government and to create a system that supports fair representation for all Americans. Whether we fight to preserve our free system of self-government for ourselves and posterity is not a choice—it is a moral obligation.\n\n_Liz Kennedy is Director of Democracy and Government Reform at the Center for American Progress_\nDoc 2(Title: Lobbying and influence) \n![Image 1](https://www.oecd.org/media/oecdorg/directorates/directorateforpublicgovernance/2024/lobbying-birds-300x237.JPG)\n\nA wide range of stakeholders should have a fair and equitable opportunity to contribute to public decision-making, allowing policymakers to decide on the best course of action on any given policy issue.\n\nPublic decision-making however may at times only consider the interests of a few, and undue influence can also be exercised without the direct involvement or knowledge of public decision makers or citizens. These challenges increase in today’s environment of information overload, with new mechanisms and channels of influence, such as social media and artificial intelligence tools, and lobbying and influence by foreign actors, including foreign governments and their related entities or individuals.\n\nLobbying and influence activities that seek to manipulate and deceive decision makers or the broader public, skew democratic processes in favour of narrow interest groups, or intentionally harm the collective interest of societies, can exacerbate economic and social inequalities, bias the outcome of an election, or even lead to deadly policy outcomes.\n\n**An ambitious, state-of-the art standard to strengthen transparency and integrity in lobbying and influence**\n\nThe 2024 OECD Recommendation on Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying and Influence provides concrete guidance for governments on ensuring lobbying and influence activities support public decision-making while safeguarding integrity, transparency and equity in public decision-making processes.\n\n**  \nConcretely, the Recommendation:**\n\n*   Covers all actors involved in lobbying and influence activities, including traditional lobbyists, as well as other actors, like businesses, civil society organisations, think tanks, lobbying firms or law firms representing third-party clients, business and trade associations, trade unions, and the natural persons who are mandated to represent these interests, whether or not they receive compensation for their activities.\n*   Encompasses the broad toolbox of influence activities that lobbying and influence actors use to engage in public decision-making processes and shape policy discourses. This includes, for example, activities to shape public opinion and policy debates through communications campaigns or influencing journalists, as well as providing contributions to political parties and candidates.\n*   Addresses the risks of interference by foreign powers in democratic processes through covert and deceptive lobbying and influence practices, by recommending the disclosure of all lobbying and influence activities conducted by any lobbying and influence actor on behalf of foreign state interests, including foreign governments, foreign political parties, or foreign state-owned and controlled entities. The principles also encourage governments to better account for these risks in their pre/post-public employment regulations.\n*   Provides for transparency and integrity rules for all those who are hired to provide advice or consultancy services to the government, for example individual experts or private consultancy firms, to limit the risks of undue influence and conflicts of interest.\n*   Provides a framework to support businesses and other influence actors in conducting their lobbying and influence activities in a responsible manner, including ensuring that these activities align with their public commitments on broader environmental, social and governance goals.\nDoc 3(Title: Corporate Capture Threatens Democratic Government) \nts.org reports that the [U.S. Chamber of Commerce](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s&showYear=a)—just one of many groups advocating for the interests of big business—spent $1.3 billion on lobbying the federal government compared to $720 million spent by [all labor unions](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=c&showYear=a).\n\nCorporate influence over government does not end with the passing of a law. Corporate entities with no natural limits and endless resources can wage a long-term, sustained attack across policymaking pressure points. For example, if a law is passed that corporate interests oppose, relentless industry pressure can be brought to bear on the agencies charged with enforcing that legislation. Again, in his book, Sen. Whitehouse describes “heavy lawyering of the rulemaking and enforcement processes, often as simple brute pressure to cause delay and cost” on the part of corporate interests. Furthermore, any final rule may be challenged in [courts](https://americanprogress.org/issues/courts/reports/2017/03/13/427905/trumps-supreme-court-nominee-puts-rights-corporations-individuals/) that are increasingly friendly to corporate forces at the expense of people.\n\nIn the short time that President Donald Trump has been in office, the revolving door between industry and the federal agencies regulating them is back in full swing thanks to the administration loosening restrictions on lobbyists taking posts at agencies they previously sought to influence on behalf corporate clients. The independent nonprofit newsroom [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-hundreds-of-officials-trump-has-quietly-installed-across-government) discovered dozens of federally registered lobbyists who were among the first Trump appointees to take positions in federal agencies. For example, lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry and health insurance companies are now in key posts at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; a lobbyist for the construction industry who fought wage and worker safety standards now works for the U.S. Department of Labor; a lobbyist for the extractive resources industry is now at the U.S. Department of Energy; and a for-profit college lobbyist who sought to weaken protections for students worked at the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nIn the Trump administration, as noted by Eric Lipton at _The_ _New York Times_, we continue to see “the [merging](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/us/politics/carl-icahn-trump-adviser-red-flags-ethics.html) of private business interest with government affairs.” In just one example, billionaire investor Carl Icahn has been named “special adviser to the president,” but because he is not officially a government employee, he is not subject to the same conflict of interest divestment requirements. As a consequence, Icahn maintains his majority holdings in an oil refinery while zealously advocating for a rule change that would have saved his refinery more than $200 million the previous year. We have reached an apotheosis of concentrated wealth running government for their interests—Trump’s [cabinet](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/310566-trumps-cabinet-picks-have-more-money-than-third-of-american) has more wealth than one-third of American households, and [Icahn](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/us/politics/carl-icahn-trump-adviser-red-flags-ethics.html) is wealthier than all of them combined.\n\n[_Captured_](http://thenewpress.com/books/captured)_: The Corporate Infiltration of American Democracy_ tells hard truths about the central threat posed by the rule of the rich—plutocracy—and how it is overwhelming American democracy. Sen. Whitehouse writes, “Corporate money is calling the tune in Congress; Congress is unwilling or unable to stand up to corporate power (indeed, Congress is often its agent).” These are truths that must be faced to be fixed.\n\nOur democratic society\nDoc 4(Title: Corporate Capture Threatens Democratic Government) \nAmerica faces a crisis of corporate capture of democratic government, where the economic power of corporations has been translated into political power with disastrous effects for people’s lives. In his new book, [_Captured_](http://thenewpress.com/books/captured)_: The Corporate Infiltration of American Democracy_, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) warns that “corporations of vast wealth and remorseless staying power have moved into our politics to seize for themselves advantages that can be seized only by control over government.” The book illustrates what he calls, the “immense pressure deployed by the corporate sector in our government.” We must rebalance our democracy by changing the rules to limit the power of money over government and empower people to engage politically as a countervailing force.\n\nCurrently, the domination of big money over our public institutions prevents government from being responsive to Americans. This certainly is not a new phenomenon—but it is growing. Even in 2009, before the _Citizens United v. FEC_ [ruling](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/08-205.html) removed constraints on corporate political spending, 80 percent of Americans agreed with the following statement:\n\n> I am [worried](http://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/McCutcheon-document.pdf) that large political contributions will prevent Congress from tackling the important issues facing American today, like the economic crisis, rising energy costs, reforming health care, and global warming.\n\nIn the first presidential contest after the _Citizens United_ decision, 84 percent of Americans agreed that corporate political spending drowns out the voices of average Americans, and 83 percent believed that [corporations](http://www.demos.org/publication/citizens-actually-united-bi-partisan-opposition-corporate-political-spending-and-support) and corporate CEOs have too much political power and influence. This aligns with more recent research showing that 84 percent of people think [government](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/08115321/TrustInGovernmentSlidesPublic.pdf) is benefitting special interests, and 83 percent think government is benefitting big corporations and the wealthy.\n\nAs already noted, the undue influence of corporate interests on the functions of government is not new, and Sen. Whitehouse’s book explains how Americans have faced and overcome this threat before. America’s founders recognized the danger of corporate capture: In 1816, Thomas [Jefferson](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-10-02-0390) warned the new republic to “crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of their country.” Almost a century later, President Theodore [Roosevelt](https://books.google.com/books?id=eyy4DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT28&lpg=PT28&dq=theodore+roosevelt+In+order+to+insure+a+healthy+social+and+industrial+life&source=bl&ots=hjv4_E0P9G&sig=QDAEzpW2UENcXihvSkUouuIatD8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixwaqdjPfSAhWos1QKHRvOBlsQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&q=theodore%20roosevelt%20In%20order%20to%20insure%20a%20healthy%20social%20and%20industrial%20life&f=false), in his annual address to Congress in 1907, said:\n\n> The fortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, and vest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of necessity to give to the sovereign—that is, to the Government, which represents the people as a whole—some effective power of supervision over their corporate use.\n\nPresident Roosevelt was responsible for the [first federal ban](http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a1907tillmanact) on corporate political contributions. But now America’s rules for using money in politics are out of date, and our system of government is out of balance. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has turned its back \nDoc 5(Title: Corporate Capture Threatens Democratic Government) \nfirst federal ban](http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a1907tillmanact) on corporate political contributions. But now America’s rules for using money in politics are out of date, and our system of government is out of balance. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has turned its back on reasonable limits for how concentrated wealth can be used to shape government and public choices. In 2010, _Citizens United_ allowed corporate money to be used to support or attack candidates and influence American elections. Previously, in a case overruled by _Citizens United_, the Court [upheld](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/494/652.html) corporate political spending rules, decrying “the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” In his book, Sen. Whitehouse calls out the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, which has “obediently repaid the corporate powers by changing the basic operating systems of our democracy in ways that consistently give big corporate powers even more power in our process of government, rewiring our democracy to corporate advantage.”\n\nCorporate interests can vastly outspend labor or public interest groups on elections. For example, in 2014, business interests spent [$1.1 billion](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2016-04-06/corporate-money-is-playing-a-shadowy-role-in-2016-politics) on state candidates and committees compared to the $215 million that labor groups spent. That same year, business political action committees, or PACs, [spent](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php?cycle=2014) nearly $380 million in federal elections, while labor union PACs gave close to $60 million. In 2016, it is estimated that $1 out of every $8 that went to super PACs came from corporate sources. Super PACs—which didn’t exist before 2010—raised almost $1.8 billion for the 2016 elections. Recently developed dark money channels have exploded, and more than [$800 million dollars](https://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money/basics) of political spending with no disclosure of donors has occurred since 2010. This denies voters information and blocks accountability by hiding the identity of political spenders who want to push their agendas and points of view without leaving fingerprints. Dark money has led to an increase in negative campaigning and deceptive statements in political advertisements, feeding the politics of destruction.\n\nMoreover, the anti-democratic influence of money in politics doesn’t end on election day. The dominance of corporations and business interests exists not just in election spending but also in lobbying elected officials and decision-makers. In 2012, an important study of political influence, [_Unheavenly Chorus_](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9685.html), looked at organized-interest activity aimed at influencing policymaking in Washington, D.C.. According to the [study](http://www.demos.org/stacked-deck-how-dominance-politics-affluent-business-undermines-economic-mobility-america), social welfare and labor organization made up just 2 percent of all organized-interest activity—corporations, trade associations, and business groups accounted for 48 percent. Corporations and business groups spend much more on [lobbying](http://www.demos.org/stacked-deck-how-dominance-politics-affluent-business-undermines-economic-mobility-america) than organizations that represent large constituencies of Americans. For example, between 1998 and 2016, OpenSecrets.org reports that the [U.S. Chamber of Commerce](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s&showYear=a)—just one of many groups advocating for the interests of big business—spent $1.3 billion on lobbying the federal government compared to $720 million spent by [all labor unions](https:/\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the documents provided, it appears that corporate lobbying can indeed be seen as undermining democratic principles.

In some cases, it is almost as if we’re just talking to ourselves.\nAs this happens, the algorithms figure out what we want, what is comfortable, and they just keep feeding us more of the same. Our confirmation bias compounds on itself. Meanwhile, alternative media outlets sow doubt and confusion based on what they want us to believe—even if it is not true.

In crucial cases, however, repugnance is the emotional \nexpression of deep wisdom, beyond reason&#x27;s power fully to articulate \nit. Can anyone really give an argument fully adequate to the horror \nwhich is father-daughter incest (even with consent), or having sex with \nanimals, or mutilating a corpse, or eating human flesh, or raping or \nmurdering another human being? Would anybody&#x27;s failure to give full \nrational justification for his revulsion at those practices make that \nrevulsion ethically suspect? Not at all.\n    Let me suggest that our repugnance at human cloning belongs in that \ncategory. We are repelled by the prospect of cloning human beings not \nbecause of the strangeness or novelty of the undertaking, but because \nwe intuit and feel, immediately and without argument, the violation of \nthings that we rightfully hold dear. We sense that cloning represents a \nprofound defilement of our given nature as procreative beings and of \nthe social relations built on this natural ground. We also sense that \ncloning is a radical form of child abuse. In this age in which \neverything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done and \nin which our bodies are regarded as mere instruments of our autonomous \nrational wills, repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to \ndefend the central core of our humanity. Shallow are the souls that \nhave forgotten how to shudder.\n    Yet repugnance need not stand naked before the bar of reason. The \nwisdom of our horror at human cloning can be partially articulated, \neven if that is finally one of those instances about which the heart \nhas its reasons that reason cannot entirely know.\n    I offer four objections to human cloning: (1) it constitutes \nunethical experimentation; (2) it threatens identity and individuality; \n(3) it turns procreation into manufacture (especially when understood \nas the harbinger of manipulations to come); and (4) it means despotism \nover children and perversion of parenthood. Please note: I speak only \nabout so-called reproductive cloning, not about the creation of cloned \nembryos for research (a subject to which I will have to return). The \nobjections that may be raised against creating (or using) embryos for \nresearch are entirely independent of whether the research embryos are \nproduced by cloning. What is radically distinct and radically new is \nreproductive cloning.\n    First, any attempt to clone a human being would constitute an \nunethical experiment upon the resulting child-to-be. In all the animal \nexperiments, fewer than two to three percent of all cloning attempts \nsucceed. Not only are there fetal deaths and stillborn infants, but \nmany of the so-called \\`\\`successes&#x27;&#x27; are in fact failures. As has only \nrecently become clear, there is a very high incidence of major \ndisabilities and deformities in cloned animals that attain live birth. \nCloned cows often have heart and lung problems; cloned mice later \ndevelop pathological obesity; other live-born cloned animals fail to \nreach normal developmental milestones. The problem, scientists suggest, \nmay lie in the fact that egg with the new somatic nucleus must \nreprogram itself in a matter of minutes or hours (whereas the nucleus \nof an unaltered egg has been prepared over months and years). There is \nthus a greatly increased likelihood of error in translating the genetic \ninstructions, leading to developmental defects some of which will show \nthemselves only much later. (Note well: these in\nDoc 4(Title: le activity or behavior.) As I said, this principle of refraining from every appearance of evil isn’t pertinent only to ministers. It applies to every believer who wants to maintain a godly reputation. The fact is, if your testimony in the eyes of others is important to you, you must make the decision to withdraw from, refrain from, desist from, discontinue, and permanently terminate any action that gives the appearance of evil. Although this may require a new set of rules for your life, you will be taking vital steps toward preserving your testimony and godly reputation.\nHow much is your reputation — and the reputation of the Holy One you represent — worth to you? If you want to maintain a good name and testimony in front of others, you must refrain from any action, language, or contact that gives the appearance of evil. And this is not just my suggestion — it is the commandment of God found in First Thessalonians 5:22.\nBy understanding the Greek words in this verse, we can interpret First Thessalonians 5:22 to read:\n“You need to terminate contact with any place, action, language, or relationship that gives people the impression that you are doing something wrong. It doesn’t matter what you think is acceptable; what matters is what other people perceive. So put a great deal of distance between yourself and anything you are doing that people could misinterpret and that could thereby stain your reputation.”\nSo many people have forfeited their testimony because they didn’t use their heads and think about how their actions might be perceived by others! Perception is often reality in the eye of the beholder.\nEven if you know that you’re doing nothing wrong at all, the fact remains that people don’t see your heart — they see your actions. If they see you do something that appears immoral or unethical, you will likely be judged by what they perceive.\nIf you’re like me, your highest desire is to glorify Jesus in this life in all you say and do. That’s why our hearts can agree with what Paul says in this verse — that it’s always best to “abstain from all appearance of evil” because we are His representatives on this earth!\nMY PRAYER FOR TODAY\nLord, I understand that Your Word commands me to break off and desist from doing anything that would give the impression of evil to people who are looking at my life from the outside. Today I have a new and a fuller realization of the great impact my actions can have on my reputation and on other people. Please forgive me for doing things that could be misconstrued, misunderstood, or misinterpreted. I am truly sorry. Help me today to put safeguards in my life that will help me to abstain from all appearances of evil from this point forward.\nI pray this in Jesus’ name!\nMY CONFESSION FOR TODAY\nI confess that I use common sense in the way that I conduct my life. I am thoughtful about my actions; I am careful to remember that people are watching me; and I am led by the Holy Spirit in how I conduct my life. Because I want to maintain a godly reputation, I care about what people think of me. I will not do anything that would cast a shadow on Jesus’ name, my name, or my testimony as a child of God. With God’s help, I will live a life that is free of accusation!\nI declare this by faith in Jesus’ name!\nQUESTIONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER\n- Have you ever known someone who stained his testimony because contact with a place, action, language, or relationship gave people the impression that he or she was doing something inappropriate?\n- As you look back on that particular situation now, what steps could that person have taken to circumvent the accusations and charges that were brought against him or her?\n- Are there any areas or actions in your life right now that others might perceive to be questionable? Be honest with yourself! What are those areas, and what steps should you begin to take to put distance between yourself and future accusation?\nDoc 5(Title: Abstain from all appearance of evil.) — 1 Thessalonians 5:22\nWhen I was getting started in the ministry, God blessed me with an opportunity to serve as associate pastor to an older man of God who taught me many important principles for my life and ministry. One of the most important principles he taught me — one that I now require of every leader who works in our ministry — is the necessity of abstaining from all appearance of evil.\nWhen I first heard this pastor’s rules, I thought they were a little overboard. For instance, men on the pastoral staff could not meet alone with members of the opposite sex, counsel a woman alone behind closed doors, or ride alone in a car with a woman other than one’s wife. I thought these types of rules made life very inconvenient. But the pastor was very strong on never doing anything that gave a wrong impression or that opened a door for criticism or accusation.\nI’ve been in the ministry many years and know of numerous times when pastors were accused of inappropriate behavior. The behavior was sometimes real and at other times imagined, but the opportunity for accusation was almost always the result of carelessness in keeping certain boundaries. So I now agree wholeheartedly that there is great wisdom in adhering to restrictions like the ones my senior pastor required in my early days of ministry. By taking this cautious approach, men and women of God are able to steer clear of insinuations and accusations. This, however, should apply not only to ministers of the Gospel, but to every believer who cares about the integrity of his or her witness.\nThe verse that my senior pastor used as the basis for his rules, and the verse I use in my own ministry to provide guidance to our team on such issues, was First Thessalonians 5:22. In this verse, the apostle Paul wrote, “Abstain from all appearance of evil.” Today I would like for us to take a deeper look to see what we can learn from this key verse in the Word of God.\nPaul began by saying, “Abstain.…” The word “abstain” is from the Greek word apecho. This word means to deliberately withdraw from; to stay away from; to put distance between oneself and something else; or to intentionally abstain. The word apecho is also used in First Peter 2:11, where Peter wrote, “Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.” In this case, the word “abstain” — apecho — means to deliberately refrain from something; hence, it could be translated, “…I urge you to refrain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.” The implication is that believers should put distance between themselves and temptations of the flesh and soul.\nThere are other examples of the word apecho in the New Testament that also demonstrate how this word depicts some type of distance between objects. For example:\n- In Luke 7:6, the word apecho is used to describe the physical distance between Jesus and the house of the centurion.\n- In Matthew 15:8 and Mark 7:6, the word apecho is used to describe human hearts that are hardened and therefore distant and far from God.\n- In Acts 15:20, the word apecho is used when James, the leader of the Jerusalem church, gave instructions that the new Gentile believers should abstain from food offered to idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from the consumption of raw blood. In that verse, the word apecho is so strong that it makes a demand on the new Gentile believers to withdraw from and permanently terminate their contact with these things. It is actually a command to refrain, to desist, to discontinue, and to terminate any further contact with them, and it calls for a permanent halt to the practice of allowing such contact.\nKeeping this in mind, we know that when Paul told us, “Abstain from all appearance of evil,” he was strongly urging you and me to put distance between ourselves and any appearance of evil. This Greek word apecho demands that we do not allow ev\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the provided documents, several factors contribute to the perception of increased evil:\n\n1. **Technology and Anonymity**: The internet and social media have amplified the spread of harmful content and harassment, making it easier for individuals to express extreme opinions without facing immediate consequences.\n\n2. **Disconnection and Lack of Empathy**: Increased connectivity does not necessarily lead to meaningful connections.

    "question": "Is it safe for dogs to eat bones?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the provided information, it is generally not safe for dogs to eat bones due to the risks of choking, internal injuries, and digestive issues. However, under strict supervision and with the appropriate precautions, certain types of bones can be given to dogs. Rawhide bones and specifically sized and shaped bones intended for dogs are safer options. Always consult with a veterinarian before introducing bones into your dog's diet. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> Bones can be dangerous for dogs as they can cause choking or internal injuries if swallowed. However, there are certain types of bones that are considered safe under supervision. </think>\n<search> safety of feeding dogs bones </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: ry protective of their bones.) Try a Bone After a Meal\nBecause they’ve just eaten, your dog is already full. As a result, they’re not likely to chew the bone as quickly.\nPut the Bone in the Fridge After 10 to 15 Minutes\nAfter your dog has spent 10 to 15 minutes chewing on the bone, take it away and put it in the refrigerator. Dogs have powerful jaws, and you don’t want your dog to ingest too much bone.\nThrow Out a Bone After a Few Days\nDispose of a bone after three or four days. Bacteria can grow on the surface and cause intestinal problems for your dog.\nGive Large Breeds Large Bones\nBones should be larger than the length of the dog’s muzzle, so they can’t be swallowed whole. So try giving large breeds, such as German Shepherd Dogs, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs, large bones. A beef shank bone is a good example of the type of bone to give to a large dog.\nSupervise Your Dog\nIt’s very important to check periodically on your dog when they are chewing a bone. Be ready to remove the bone if it’s breaking apart or getting too small.\nBone Alternatives\nConsider playing it safe and only providing commercially available chew toys and simulated dog bones that are made for dogs of all sizes.\nDoc 2(Title: AKC is a participant in affiliate advertising programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to akc.org. If you purchase a product through this article, we may receive a portion of the sale.) We’ve all heard the phrase “give a dog a bone,” but you might want to consider alternative treats to dog bones.\nBones can be a good source of minerals and other nutrients and help satisfy your dog’s appetite. Chewing stimulates saliva enzymes and helps prevent plaque buildup on teeth and gum disease. And a dog chewing on a bone is less inclined to excessively scratch or lick their paws.\nHowever, chewing bones can pose potential dangers to dogs. If you’re considering giving your dog a bone, consider whether it’s the right treat for your pet.\nPotential Health Hazards\nFatty Bones Can Cause Pancreatitis\nRib bones, especially pork rib bones, are high in fat. Dogs aren’t built to handle this amount of saturated fat, which can cause pancreatitis.\nPancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, often caused by too much fat in the diet. It can range from mild to severe, but symptoms typically include vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. Severe cases can be deadly, so it’s important to seek veterinary attention right away if you suspect your dog may have pancreatitis.\nCooked Bones Can Shatter and Cause Damage\nCooked bones splinter into shards. So if your dog eats one, they might choke on the tiny pieces. These pieces can cause serious damage to the dog’s mouth, throat, or intestines. Cooking can also remove nutrients from the bone.\nIf your dog does ingest cooked bones, give your veterinarian a call for advice or schedule an appointment to rule out any serious outcomes. Be careful to keep platters containing bones out of reach when you’re cooking or putting food on the table. And avoid putting bones in any trash cans that your dog might be able to get into.\nFragments Can Be Choking Hazards\nWhen your dog gnaws on a bone, they might chew it down into small pieces. Those fragments are a major choking hazard. Bone fragments can easily get lodged in your dog’s throat, blocking the airways and creating an emergency situation.\nAlso, these chunks are typically very sharp. They can puncture and cut the inside of your dog’s mouth, tongue, stomach, and intestines. Fragments of bone, especially rib bones, can also lodge in the descending colon near the rectum, causing constipation-like symptoms and pain. If this occurs, bring your dog to the veterinarian or emergency clinic for treatment.\nChunks of Bone Might Cause Blockages\nThe chance of bone chunks getting stuck in the intestines is fairly high. Blockages can occur if a bone fragment is too large to pass through the gut and obstructs the flow of all other digested food through the gastrointestinal tract. Obstructions are very serious and can quickly lead to severe illness and death.\nBones Can Irritate Canine Stomachs\nA bone and its marrow can cause diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome. Bones could also further irritate already sensitive stomachs.\nWhat to Do When Giving Your Dog a Bone\nAsk Your Vet About Raw Meat Bones\nSome veterinarians suggest raw meat bones for dogs. But raw meat bones may carry bacteria like salmonella. And bones that are too hard, even raw bones, could damage your dog’s teeth. If a bone is harder than a tooth, the tooth can fracture and your dog will need an expensive dental evaluation and treatment. So before giving your dog a raw meat bone, ask your vet if this would be a safe treat.\nGive Your Dog a Bone if They’re Alone\nIt’s a good idea not to give your dog a bone if there’s another dog visiting. Even friendly dogs can be very protective of their bones.\nTry a Bone After a Meal\nBecause they’ve just eaten, your dog is already full. As a result, they’re not likely to chew the bone as quickly.\nPut the Bone in the Fridge After 10 to 15 Minutes\nAfter your dog has spent 10 to 15 minutes chewing on the bone, take it away and p\nDoc 3(Title: Weâre sorry, this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.)

In most animals, reproductive cloning \ncurrently has no better than a 3 to 5 percent success rate. In fact, \nscientists have been attempting to clone numerous species for the past \n15 years with no success at all. What that means, simply and \ngraphically, is that very few of the cloned animal embryos implanted in \na surrogate mother animal survive. The others either die in utero--\nsometimes at very late stages of pregnancy--or die soon after birth. \nOnly in cattle have we begun to achieve some improvement. What I am \nsaying is that we cannot extrapolate to humans the data from the \nhandful of species in which reproductive cloning is now possible. This \ngrim record emphasizes just how unsafe this procedure is, whether it&#x27;s \napplied to sheep, goats, dogs, cats, whatever.\n    I understand that it took over 270 attempts before Dolly was \nsuccessfully cloned. Even if the odds of cloning a healthy child were \nbrought down to one in three or one in two, it would be simply \nunacceptable. Rogue and grandstanding so-called scientists who claim \nthey can--and will--clone humans for reproductive purposes insult the \nhundreds of thousands of responsible, reputable scientists who are \nworking hard to find new therapies and cures for millions of \nindividuals suffering from a wide range of genetic diseases and \nconditions.\n    The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has publicly stated that it \nhas jurisdiction over human reproductive cloning experiments and that \nit will not approve them. BIO supports that view and hopes that the \nnext FDA commissioner--whoever that might be--will assert FDA&#x27;s current \nstatutory authority forcefully.\n                 beneficial uses of cloning technology\n    Allow me to shift gears now, and make a critical distinction. It is \ncritical to distinguish the use of cloning technology to create a \nbaby--reproductive cloning--from therapeutic cloning. Therapeutic \ncloning techniques are central to the production of breakthrough \nmedicines, diagnostics and vaccines to treat Alzheimer&#x27;s, diabetes, \nParkinson&#x27;s, heart attacks, various cancers and hundreds of other \ngenetic diseases. Therapeutic cloning could also produce replacement \nskin, cartilage and bone tissue for burn and accident victims and bring \nus ways to regenerate retinal and spinal cord tissue. Therapeutic \ncloning cannot produce a whole human being. This work should be allowed \nto move forward.\n    Allow me a minute or two to explain how therapeutic cloning can be \nused to develop products that will greatly improve the practice of \nmedicine and, in turn, enormously improve the quality of life of \nindividuals suffering from many of the most serious illnesses known to \nhuman kind.\n    Regenerative Medicine\n    Many diseases disrupt cellular function or destroy tissue. Heart \nattacks, strokes and diabetes are examples of common conditions in \nwhich critical cells are lost to disease. Today&#x27;s medicine cannot \ncompletely restore this function. Regenerative medicine holds the \npotential to cause an individual&#x27;s malfunctioning cells to work \nproperly again or even to replace dead or irreparably damaged cells \nwith fresh, healthy ones, thereby restoring organ function. The goal is \nto provide cells that won&#x27;t be rejected when they are transplanted into \nthe body.\n    Again, as I wrote in my letter to President Bush in February, \\`\\`To \nbe perfectly clear, we support cloning of specific human cells, genes \nand other tissues that do not and cannot lead to a cloned human \nbeing.&#x27;&#x27; Therapeutic cloning technology can create pure populations of \nfunctional cells to replace damaged cells in the human body.

How blacks and whites view the state of race in America\nThere are large gaps between blacks and whites in their views of race relations and racial inequality in the United States. Explore how the opinions of blacks and whites vary by age, education, gender and party identification in key questions from our report.\nThe economic realities of black and white households\nTrends in key economic and demographic indicators provide some context for the experiences and outlook of blacks today. While there has been clear progress in closing the white-black gap in some areas – particularly when it comes to high school completion rates – decades-old black-white gaps in economic well-being persist and have even widened in some cases.\nThe racial gap extends to household wealth – a measure where the gap has widened since the Great Recession. In 2013, the most recent year available, the median net worth of households headed by whites was roughly 13 times that of black households ($144,200 for whites compared with $11,200 for blacks).\nFor most Americans, household wealth is closely tied to home equity, and there are sharp and persistent gaps in homeownership between blacks and whites. In 2015, 72% of white household heads owned a home, compared with 43% of black household heads.\nAnd on the flipside of wealth – poverty – racial gaps persist, even though the poverty rate for blacks has come down significantly since the mid-1980s. Blacks are still more than twice as likely as whites to be living in poverty (26% compared with 10% in 2014).\nBlacks and whites are divided on reasons that blacks may be struggling to get ahead\nDespite these economic realities, when asked about the financial situation of blacks compared with whites today, about four-in-ten blacks either say that both groups are about equally well off (30%) or that blacks are better off than whites financially (8%). Still, about six-in-ten (58%) blacks say that, as a group, they are worse off than whites.\nAmong whites, a plurality (47%) say blacks are worse off financially, while 37% say blacks are about as well off as whites and 5% say blacks are doing better than whites.\nBlacks and whites with a bachelor’s degree are more likely than those with less education to say blacks are worse off financially than whites these days. Roughly eight-in-ten (81%) blacks with a four-year college degree say this, compared with 61% of blacks with only some college education and 46% of blacks with a high school diploma or less. In a similar pattern, about two-thirds (66%) of white college graduates say blacks are worse off financially than whites, while fewer among those who attended college but did not receive a degree (47%) and those who did not attend college (29%) say the same.\nWhen asked about the underlying reasons that blacks may be having a harder time getting ahead than whites, large majorities of black adults point to societal factors. Two-thirds or more blacks say failing schools (75%), racial discrimination (70%) and a lack of jobs (66%) are major reasons that black people may have a harder time getting ahead these days.\nOn each of these items, the views of blacks differ significantly from those of whites. But, by far, the biggest gap comes on racial discrimination, where only 36% of whites say this is a major reason that blacks may be struggling to get ahead, 34 percentage points lower than the share of blacks who say the same.\nThe views of blacks and whites are more closely aligned when it comes to the impact that family instability (57% and 55%, respectively) and a lack of good role models (51% and 52%) has on black progress. However, the relative ranking of these items varies among blacks and whites. While w\nDoc 2(Title: Racial pay gap in the United States) In the United States, despite the efforts of equality proponents, income inequality persists among races[1] and ethnicities. Asian Americans have the highest median income, followed by White Americans, Hispanic Americans, African Americans, and Native Americans.[2] A variety of explanations for these differences have been proposed—such as differing access to education,[3] two parent home family structure (70% of African American children are born to parents who are not legally married), high school dropout rates and experience of discrimination and deep-seated and systemic anti-Black racism—and the topic is highly controversial.\nWhen the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, it became illegal for employers to discriminate based on race;[4] however, income disparities have not flattened out.[5][6][7] After the passage of the act, the wage gap for minority groups narrowed, both in absolute difference with white wages and as a percentage of white wages, until the mid-1970s; at this time, progress for many racial minorities slowed, stopped, or reversed.[6] As of 2009, the median weekly wage for African American and Hispanic workers was about 65 percent and 61 percent that of white workers, respectively. Asian workers' median wage was about 110 percent that of white workers.[8] Overall, minority women's wages in comparison to those of white women are better than minority men's wages when compared to those of white men.[6]\nWages from the labor market are the primary source of income for most families in America,[6] and income is a socio-demographic status indicator that is important in understanding the building of wealth.[7]\nHistory of the racial wage gap\n[edit]The documented history of the racial wage gap in the United States goes back before the Civil Rights Act, where many modern causes of racial wage inequity, such as educational disparities and discrimination, stem from were even more prevalent. Public state records from the 1930s indicate white owned schools in the south spent approximately $61 per student, or $1,074.14 in 2018 dollars when adjusted for inflation, compared to just $9 per student, or $158.48 in 2018 dollars. Simultaneously, the same schools saw a discrepancy in school time, with white schools in sessions for 156 days on average, compared to 123 days on average for black schools.[9]\nWhile statistical measures of wage discrepancy between black individuals and their white counterparts exist, wage inequity is still poorly understood due to a lack of literature with solid empirical data to link data with an accurate model of wage discrimination.[9] During the 1970s and 80s the scholarly community debated the link between geographical location and wage inequality. Following urban-dominated studies and shifting research based on evolved conceptual and study-driven thinking, sociologists determined that the racial composition of a local population affects racial wage inequality. Studies performed by Leslie Mcall[10] indicate immigration population density is one of the leading factors in racial wage inequality. While black immigrant earnings do not deviate from the already substandard average earnings,[11][12] numbers on Hispanic and Asian immigrant earnings suggest more extensive negative effects, especially in areas of high immigration density. Hispanic and Asian women, in particular, are shown to be most affected; Hispanic and Asian women are shown to fill less skilled, domestic service jobs where the concentration of their black and white counterparts are lower. Barriers such as language show that such large dominance of immigrant population in such sectors only breed competition between lower-earning groups, further lowering average wages for such families.[10] Since 1980, studies have found that, conversely, such low earning labor may actually boost the economy as a whole, keeping many corporations and higher level jobs afloat with cheap skilled work, boosting the salaries of n\nDoc 3(Title: More than four-in-ten Americans say the country still has work to do to give black people equal rights with whites. Blacks, in particular, are skeptical that black people will ever have equal rights in this country.) Americans generally think being white is an advantage in society, while about half or more say being black or Hispanic hurts people’s ability to get ahead. Opinions are more mixed when it comes to what impact, if any, being Asian or Native American has.\nMost adults, regardless of race or ethnicity, say blacks are treated less fairly than whites in encounters with police and by the criminal justice system, but there’s less consensus about the treatment of blacks in other situations, such as when applying for a loan or mortgage or in stores or restaurants.\nThis chapter also explores what Americans see as obstacles for black people getting ahead as well as attitudes about what impact, if any, the legacy of slavery has on the current status of blacks.\nMajorities see advantages for whites, disadvantages for blacks\nA majority of adults say that being white helps people’s ability to get ahead in the country at least a little (59%); 28% say being white neither helps nor hurts and 12% say it hurts. On the flip side, a majority (56%) sees being black as a disadvantage, with 25% saying it hurts people’s ability to get ahead a lot. About a quarter (26%) say being black neither helps nor hurts and 17% say it helps at least a little.\nMore also say that being Hispanic hurts people’s ability to get ahead in this country (51%) than say it helps (18%) or that it neither helps nor hurts (30%). Opinions are more split when it comes to the impact of being Native American – about the same shares say this hurts as say it neither helps nor hurts, while a smaller share says it helps. And while a plurality says being Asian neither helps nor hurts, more say it helps (34%) than hurts (21%) people’s ability to get ahead.\nMajorities across racial and ethnic groups say being white helps one’s ability to get ahead, though Asians (73%), blacks (69%) and Hispanics (61%) are more likely than whites (56%) to say this.\nAmong whites, education and partisanship are linked to perceptions of white advantage. About three-quarters of whites with at least a bachelor’s degree (72%) say being white helps at least a little, compared with 52% of those with some college experience and 43% of those with a high school education or less.\nWhite Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are about twice as likely as white Republicans and Republican leaners to say being white helps one’s ability to get ahead (78% vs. 38%). Meanwhile, 22% of white Republicans say being white hurts people’s ability to get ahead at least a little (compared with 3% of white Democrats). White Democrats are more likely than black Democrats to say whites have an advantage (78% vs. 71%).\nAmong blacks, 76% of those with a bachelor’s degree or more education say being white helps a lot, compared with 61% of those with some college and 49% of those with a high school diploma or less education (a majority in this group – 57% – says being white helps at least a little). And while about six-in-ten blacks ages 30 and older say there’s a lot of advantage in being white, about half (49%) of those younger than 30 say the same (again, majorities of blacks across age groups say being white helps at least a little).\nAsked about the extent to which being black helps or hurts one’s ability to get ahead, 68% of blacks and 64% of Asians say being black hurts at least a little; 55% of whites and half of Hispanics say the same. Blacks are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to say being black hurts a lot: 42% say this vs. a third or fewer among Asians, whites and Hispanics.\nAmong whites, blacks and Hispanics, those with at least a bachelor’s degree are more likely than those with less education to say race hurts blacks’ ability to get ahead. Some 81% of black college graduates and 74% of\nDoc 4(Title: Almost eight years after Barack Obama’s election as the nation’s first black president –an event that engendered a sense of optimism among many Americans about the future of race relations1 – a series of flashpoints around the U.S. has exposed deep racial divides and reignited a national conversation about race. A new Pew Research Center survey finds profound differences between black and white adults in their views on racial discrimination, barriers to black progress and the prospects for change. Blacks, far more than whites, say black people are treated unfairly across different realms of life, from dealing with the police to applying for a loan or mortgage. And, for many blacks, racial equality remains an elusive goal.) These findings are based on a national survey by Pew Research Center conducted Feb. 29-May 8, 2016, among 3,769 adults (including 1,799 whites, 1,004 blacks and 654 Hispanics).2 The survey – and the analysis of the survey findings – is centered primarily around the divide between blacks and whites and on the treatment of black people in the U.S. today. In recent years, this centuries-old divide has garnered renewed attention following the deaths of unarmed black Americans during encounters with the police, as well as a racially motivated shooting that killed nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\nThe survey finds that black and white adults have widely different perceptions about what life is like for blacks in the U.S. For example, by large margins, blacks are more likely than whites to say black people are treated less fairly in the workplace (a difference of 42 percentage points), when applying for a loan or mortgage (41 points), in dealing with the police (34 points), in the courts (32 points), in stores or restaurants (28 points), and when voting in elections (23 points). By a margin of at least 20 percentage points, blacks are also more likely than whites to say racial discrimination (70% vs. 36%), lower quality schools (75% vs. 53%) and lack of jobs (66% vs. 45%) are major reasons that blacks may have a harder time getting ahead than whites.\nBlacks and whites also differ in their opinions about the best approach for improving race relations: Among whites, more than twice as many say that in order to improve race relations, it’s more important to focus on what different racial and ethnic groups have in common (57%) as say the focus should be on what makes each group unique (26%). Among blacks, similar shares say the focus should be on commonalities (45%) as say it should be on differences (44%).\nWhen asked specifically about the impact President Barack Obama has had on race relations in the U.S., a majority of Americans give the president credit for at least trying to make things better, but a quarter say he has made race relations worse. Blacks and whites differ significantly in their assessments. Some 51% of blacks say Obama has made progress toward improving race relations, and an additional 34% say he has tried but failed to make progress. Relatively few blacks (5%) say Obama has made race relations worse, while 9% say he hasn’t addressed the issue at all.\nWhen asked about their views of Black Lives Matter, the activist movement that first came to national prominence following the 2014 shooting death of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, roughly two-thirds (65%) of blacks express support, including 41% who strongly support it. Among whites, four-in-ten say they support the Black Lives Movement at least somewhat, and this is particularly the case among white Democrats and those younger than 30.\nAnd while about eight-in-ten (78%) white Democrats say the country needs to continue making changes to achieve racial equality between whites and blacks, just 36% of white Republicans agree; 54% of white Republicans believe the country has already made the changes necessary for blacks to have equal rights with whites.\nHow blacks an\nDoc 5(Title: nough in giving black people equal rights with whites, 54% say this is likely to happen eventually and 46% say it’s not too or not at all likely.) Most say legacy of slavery affects black people’s position in society a great deal or fair amount\nFor the most part, Americans believe slavery continues to have an impact on black people’s status. About six-in-ten U.S. adults say the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people in American society today either a great deal (31%) or a fair amount (32%). Some 36% say slavery doesn’t have much or anything at all to do with the current situation of black people.\nBlacks are by far the most likely to say slavery continues to have an impact. More than eight-in-ten say slavery affects the position of black people at least a fair amount, including 59% who say it does so a great deal. By comparison, 26% of whites, 29% of Hispanics and 33% of Asians say slavery affects the situation of black people today a great deal, though majorities of each group say it does so at least a fair amount.\nAmong whites, 18- to 29-year-olds are the most likely to say slavery still has an impact today. About two-thirds of whites in that age group say this (68%), compared with 55% of 30- to 49-year-olds, 54% of 50- to 64-year-olds and 60% of those 65 and older. Age differences are less evident among blacks.\nEducation is also associated with views of whether slavery still has an effect today, and this is the case among whites and blacks. Whites with a bachelor’s degree or higher (67%) are more likely to say that slavery continues to have a great deal or a fair amount of influence on black people’s position in society, compared with 56% of those with some college experience and 50% of those with a high school diploma or less. Blacks with at least a bachelor’s degree or some college experience (90% of each group) are also more likely than those with a high school diploma or less (76%) to say this.\nWhite Democrats are twice as likely as white Republicans to say that the legacy of slavery has had a lasting impact (80% vs. 40%). Black Democrats are even more likely to say this is the case (87% do so).\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information gathered, it is clear that while there have been significant advancements in civil rights, black people and white people in America do not yet have truly equal rights. There are still significant economic, social, and political disparities. For instance, there are racial pay gaps, racial wealth gaps, and disparities in homeownership. Additionally, there are still widespread perceptions of racial discrimination and unfair treatment in various aspects of life, such as interactions with law enforcement and accessing loans. Many Americans, particularly whites, believe that being white provides an advantage in society, while being black is often seen as a disadvantage.\n\nIn summary, <answer>no, black people and white people in America do not currently have equal rights. </answer>",

Wrong. While the belief that sugar causes hyperactivity in children is widespread and perpetuated by the children themselves, it’s a myth, according to Sabiha Kanchwala, MD, general pediatrics specialist at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital.) The popularized Feingold diet, which eliminated food additives, brought sugar under close scrutiny in the 1970s. But some years later in the 1980s, the Feingold diet came under the same scrutiny, and multiple contradicting studies were established. The findings concluded sugar has no influence on children’s behavior.\n“We’re almost 40 years later, and people still think sugars make their kids really active or hyperactive,” Kanchwala says.\nExpectation and perception\nKanchwala says a large part of this myth comes from the power of our own minds. If we go into a situation expecting a certain outcome, we will likely see that outcome. It’s a placebo effect.\n“Even children know the power of their brains. They say, ‘I ate all this candy, I’m never going to go to sleep!’” Kanchwala says. “We know sugar in and of itself is not what’s making your child hyper, but there are a variety of other things leading to their excessive activity.”\nMost often, hyperactivity in children results from poor sleep. Kanchwala recommends following careful sleep hygiene to ensure your child sleeps enough. Turn off electronics well before bedtime, create a sleep conducive environment, follow a bedtime routine (including time), and make sure your child gets anywhere from 10-12 hours a night for school-aged children, and 8-10 hours a night for teenagers. Getting enough exercise during the day also helps children sleep.\n“Adults are more tired and somnolent throughout the day when they’re not getting good sleep; kids can be really hyper,” Kanchwala says. “One of the biggest factors for patient’s hyperactivity is lack of sleep.”\nA chronic condition can also cause hyper behavior, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Kanchwala says these kids’ behavior can look like hyperactivity when it’s not. If you believe your child struggles with a such a condition, speak to your pediatrician about an evaluation right away, particularly for school-aged children.\nOther factors include stress, trauma, or caffeine. Some candies, such as chocolate, contain caffeine and create a supposed ‘sugar rush.’ Caffeine can prevent drowsiness, cause restlessness, increase heart rate, and cause other side effects. It’s possible your child’s behavior matches up with caffeine intake.\nIt’s important to remember that children are children, and what a parent interprets as hyperactivity may be the natural, healthy energy of young life. Delve into the source of your child’s hyperactivity. Consider when and where your child’s hyperactivity blooms, if their hyperactivity corresponds with their sleep, or if another kind of behavioral health issue might play a role.\nSugar’s actual effect\nSugar itself may not make your child hyper, but it does affect your child’s health and future. Kanchwala says processed sugar intake leads to obesity in childhood. This major health problem results in both childhood and adulthood health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, liver disease, and even mental health conditions.\nProcessed sugar often shows up on labels of overall unhealthy foods — fast, processed foods that make easy grab-and-go snacks for a busy household.\n“Unfortunately, foods readily available are going to have added sugars that make it taste better and last longer,” Kanchwala says. “Parents should be mindful of the foods children eat that contain this processed sugar.”\nThe more unprocessed the diet, the healthier for the child, says Kanchwala. She recommends avoiding juice and other sugary snacks such as fruit gummies and replacing them with foods containing naturally occurring sugars.

Research shows these advertisements reach, and strongly influence, children and teens.\nSmoke Signals\nNearly 7 out of 10 middle and high school students say they've seen e-cigarette ads, for example, according to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. Statistics like these worry public health experts, since studies show the more cigarette ads teens see, the more likely they are to try smoking. Research also suggests that seeing characters who smoke in movies makes them more likely to try cigarettes.\nMany teens who try smoking don't stop. In fact, about 9 out of 10 smokers began the habit by age 18, according to a U.S. Surgeon General\nreport.\nTeens go through big developmental changes, forming their own identities and taking more risks. They also begin to pay more attention to being accepted by friends. One\nstudy found that cigarette ads may make teens feel like smoking would make them popular, sophisticated, attractive or tough.\nWhat Parents Can Do\nBe aware of and discuss how seemingly subtle points in cigarette ads can send a powerful, and potentially harmful, message to teens.\nTalk with your teen. Teens really do value the opinions of their parents. If you are with your teen and you see a cigarette ad, talk about it. Tell your teen that his or her feelings are important, and start a constructive and respectful discussion where both of you can express your feelings and opinions about smoking.\nThink beyond tobacco. E-cigarettes and other electronic smoking devices, such as\nhookah, might be advertised as less harmful to health than regular cigarettes. Ads may make a point of saying that e-cigarettes vaporize flavored “vape juice\" rather than burning tobacco. Make sure your teen knows the nicotine from vaping is still highly addictive. In addition,\nresearch shows teens who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke regular tobacco. This research supports the concept that e-cigs serve as a “gateway\" to traditional cigarettes.\nMonitor screen time. Many teens exposed to cigarette ads, especially those for e-cigarettes, report seeing them on the internet and TV (unlike ads for regular cigarettes, e-cigarette ads are legally allowed to air on TV). A 2018\nstudy in Pediatrics found that teenagers who watched videos about tobacco products online, for example, were more likely to try and use tobacco products more frequently. They were also less likely to stop using the products. Make a family\nmedia use plan to help limit the influence of these ads on your children.\nIdentify your teen's talents. Adolescence is a time when teens are trying to find their identity. It is important for parents to be positive about their teen's talents and goals—whether it be basketball or social studies. This will help them develop a strong sense of identity outside of potentially unhealthy habits.\nGet involved in the community. Whether it be with the school's parent-teacher association or local health programs in your city, parents have a strong voice in the\ncommunity. You can say no to cigarette ads in places where your child lives and plays.\nShop Around. If your local pharmacy or mini-mart displays cigarette ads, consider shopping at stores that do not sell traditional cigarettes or e-cigarettes.\nRemember\nCigarette ads can have a strong influence on children and teens. But there are steps you can take to protect against their powerful pull, helping kids avoid a future clouded by tobacco and nicotine.\nMore information:\nAbout Dr. Duh-Leong:\nDoc 4(Title: rug I., McLean S.A.

Moreover, in Korea, there are little data on how much simple sugar children obtain from snacks or if higher consumption of simple sugar is associated with ADHD risk.) Snacks play a critical role in the diets of school-age children, given that they supply additional nutrients as well as refreshment, mental relaxation, and emotional stability [2]. However, in Korea as well as other developed countries, sugar consumption has steadily increased with economic growth [17]. Over-consumption of saturated fat and simple sugar from fast foods, instant foods, and carbonated drinks is considered a potential risk factor for obesity, decayed teeth, and diabetes [18]. Due to these problems, the World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed that the proportion of daily calories obtained from simple sugar be 10% or less.\nTherefore, this study was designed to investigate the consumption of simple sugar from snacks, the relationship between ADHD and sugar consumption, and the quality of diet and dietary behaviors of fifth graders at primary schools in Seoul. For this, we investigated sugar consumption from meals and snacks over 1 day and examined ADHD development based on teachers' ratings.\nSubjects and Methods\nParticipants\nA total of 112 students, 58 boys and 54 girls, enrolled in the fifth grade at two elementary schools in Seoul participated in this study. Data collection was conducted from December 17, 2008 to April 10, 2009 using a questionnaire that was administrated to subjects and completed individually with the help of trained researchers. Questionnaires were collected from 112 subjects and five were excluded due to incompleteness. The data of 107 subjects were used in the final analysis, representing a response rate of 95.5%.\nMeasurements and procedure\nTwo types of questionnaires, one for teachers and one for students, were used for data collection. The questionnaire for teachers was based on the Conner Abbreviated Teacher Rating Scale (CATRS-10) [3,4,19], which is a widely accepted measurement tool for ADHD symptoms, and a revised 'hyperactivity rating scale' developed by Goyette, Conners, and Ulrich [20] with 10 question items. A total score was obtained for the 10 items (0 = not at all, 1 = just a little, 2 = pretty much, and 3 = very much hyperactive), which characterized subjects based on deficit-attention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. The homeroom teachers completed the questionnaire by considering students' behaviors displayed over the previous 10 months. Possible scores ranged from 0 to 30 points, with higher scores indicating higher severity of the listed behavioral issues.\nThe second questionnaire for students was separated into three sections: dietary assessment, 10 items about dietary behaviors, and demographic variables.

Putin also served as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000[e] and again from 2008 to 2012.[f][7] He has been described as the de facto leader of Russia since 2000.[8]\nPutin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He resigned in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, less than four months later in May 2000, was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations on two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018.\nDuring Putin's initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year[9] as a result of economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas.[10][11] Additionally, Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists, re-establishing federal control over the region.[12][13] While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions which together with a drop in oil prices led to the financial crisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war.\nIn February 2022, during his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts into Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes[14] related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war.[15] In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed constitutional amendments into law that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036.[16][17] In March 2024, he was reelected to another term.\nUnder Putin's rule, the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship with a personality cult. His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections.[18][19][20] Russia has consistently received very low scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, The Economist Democracy Index, Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, and the Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index.\nEarly life and education\nPutin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia),[21] the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin, was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.[22][23] Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 durin\nDoc 2(Title: . 1 on the Time's Most Influential People List.[426][427] Forbes ranked him the World's Most Powerful Individual every year from 2013 to 2016.[428] He was ranked the second most powerful individual by Forbes in 2018.[429]) In Germany, the word \"Putinversteher\" (female form \"Putinversteherin\") is a neologism and a political buzzword (Putin + verstehen), which literally translates \"Putin understander\", i.e., \"one who understands Putin\".[430] It is a pejorative reference to politicians and pundits who express empathy to Putin and may also be translated as \"Putin-empathizer\".[431]\nPutinisms\nPutin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms.[432] Many of them were first made during his annual Q&A conferences, where Putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language, often alluding to Russian jokes and folk sayings.[432] Putin sometimes uses Russian criminal jargon (known as \"fenya\" in Russian), albeit not always correctly.[433]\nAssessments\nAssessments of Putin's character as a leader have evolved during his long presidency. His shifting of Russia towards autocracy and weakening of the system of representative government advocated by Boris Yeltsin has met with criticism.[434] Russian dissidents and western leaders now frequently characterise him as a \"dictator\". Others have offered favourable assessments of his impact on Russia.\nOtto von Habsburg, the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary and former Member of the European Parliament, was an early critic of Putin. In a newspaper interview[435] in 2002 and in two speeches[436] in 2003 and 2005, he warned of Putin as an \"international threat\", that he was \"cruel and oppressive\", and a \"stone cold technocrat\".[437]\nPutin was described in 2015 as a \"dictator\" by political opponent Garry Kasparov,[438] and as the \"Tsar of corruption\" in 2016 by opposition activist and blogger Alexei Navalny.[439] He was described as a \"bully\" and \"arrogant\" by former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton,[440][441][442] and as \"self-centered\" by the Dalai Lama.[443] In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a \"raw materials colony\" of China.[444]\nFormer U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger wrote in 2014 that the West has demonized Putin.[445] Egon Krenz, former leader of East Germany, said the Cold War never ended, adding: \"After weak presidents like Gorbachev and Yeltsin, it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin\".[446]\nMany Russians credit Putin for reviving Russia's fortunes.[447] Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while acknowledging the flawed democratic procedures and restrictions on media freedom during the Putin presidency, said that Putin had pulled Russia out of chaos at the end of the Yeltsin years, and that Russians \"must remember that Putin saved Russia from the beginning of a collapse\".[447][448] Chechen Republic head and Putin supporter, Ramzan Kadyrov, stated prior to 2011 that Putin saved both the Chechen people and Russia.[449]\nRussia has suffered democratic backsliding during Putin's tenure.[450] Freedom House has listed Russia as being \"not free\" since 2005.[451] Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy,[452][453][454] citing purges and jailing of political opponents,[455][456] curtailed press freedom,[457][458][459] and the lack of free and fair elections.[460][461][462] In 2004, Freedom House warned that Russia's \"retreat from freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989, when the country was part of the Soviet Union\".[463]\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Russia as \"authoritarian\" since 2011,[464][465] whereas it had previously been considered a \"hybrid regime\" (with \"some form of democratic government\" in place).[466] According to political scientist Larry Diamond,\nDoc 3(Title: w York: Routledge.

In the global turn against democracy, he has played, at times, the role of figurehead, impish provocateur, and field marshal. We are living in the Age of Vladimir Putin.\nElectoral history\nVladimir Putin has been nominated and elected as President of Russia all five times since 2000, typically under an independent banner. In the most recent 2024 Russian presidential election, Putin achieved 88% of the popular vote.[489] There were reports of irregularities at this election,[490] including ballot stuffing and coercion.[491][492] Russian authorities claimed that in occupied areas of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions,[493] Putin won 88.12% and 92.83% of votes.[494] In Chechnya, Putin won 98.99% of the vote.[64]\nPersonal life\nFamily\nOn 28 July 1983, Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva, and they lived together in East Germany from 1985 to 1990. They have two daughters, Maria Putina, born on 28 April 1985 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and Yekaterina Putina, born on 31 August 1986 in Dresden, East Germany (now Germany).[495]\nAn investigation by Proekt published in November 2020 alleged that Putin has another daughter, Elizaveta, also known as Luiza Rozova,[496] (born in March 2003),[497] with Svetlana Krivonogikh.[4][498] Elizaveta studied in Paris under the name Elizaveta Olegovna Rudnova.[499] In April 2008, the Moskovsky Korrespondent reported that Putin had divorced Lyudmila and was engaged to marry Olympic gold medalist Alina Kabaeva, a former rhythmic gymnast and Russian politician.[2] The story was denied,[2] and the newspaper was shut down shortly thereafter.[3] Putin and Lyudmila continued to make public appearances together as spouses,[500][501] while the status of his relationship with Kabaeva became a topic of speculation.[502]\nOn 6 June 2013, Putin and Lyudmila announced that their marriage was over; on 1 April 2014, the Kremlin confirmed that the divorce had been finalised.[503][504][505] Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to a daughter by Putin in 2015;[506][507] this report was denied.[506] Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to twin sons by Putin in 2019.[5][508] However, in 2022, Swiss media, citing the couple's Swiss gynecologist, wrote that on both occasions Kabaeva gave birth to a boy.[6]\nPutin has two grandsons, born in 2012 and 2017,[509][510] through Maria.[511] He reportedly also has a granddaughter, born in 2017, through Katerina.[512][513] His cousin, Igor Putin, was a director at Moscow-based Master Bank and was accused in a number of money-laundering scandals.[514][515]\nWealth\nOfficial figures released during the legislative election of 2007 put Putin's wealth at approximately 3.7 million rubles (US$280,000) in bank accounts, a private 77.4-square-meter (833 sq ft) apartment in Saint Petersburg, and miscellaneous other assets.[516][517] Putin's reported 2006 income totaled 2 million rubles (approximately $152,000). In 2012, Putin reported an income of 3.6 million rubles ($270,000).[518][519] Putin has been photographed wearing several expensive wristwatches, collectively valued at $700,000, nearly six times his annual salary.[520][521] Putin has been known on occasion to give watches valued at thousands of dollars as gifts, for example a watch identified as a Blancpain to a Siberian boy he met while on vacation in 2009, and another similar watch to a factory worker the same year.[522]\nAccording to Russian opposition politicians and journalists,[523][524] Putin s\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, the term \"Putin stooge\" refers to someone who is perceived to have a close alignment or support for Putin's policies and actions.

    "question": "Should polygamous marriages be made legal?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information gathered, the legality of polygamy raises significant concerns regarding gender equality, child welfare, and societal stability. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Legal Framework**: In the U.S., polygamy is illegal, and this law is based on the belief that it violates women's rights to equality in marriage. There is no evidence that the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to overturn this stance.\n\n2. **Human Rights and Equality**: Legal polygamy is seen as a violation of women's rights to equality in marriage. This includes unequal responsibilities and support for children, and increased risk of domestic violence and abuse.\n\n3. **Societal Impact**: Legalizing polygamy might undermine societal norms and potentially lead to more secretive and isolated communities, which could harm women and children.\n\n4. **Public Opinion**: While there is a small percentage of the population that supports polygamy, the general public and media often view it negatively, reinforcing traditional monogamous values.\n\nGiven these points, making polygamous marriages legal in the United States would likely face significant challenges and potential negative consequences. Therefore, it is not advisable to make polygamous marriages legal.</think>\n\n<answer> No, polygamous marriages should not be made legal. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> To address this question, I need to consider various perspectives including legal, social, and ethical aspects. However, my current knowledge base does not provide a comprehensive analysis of these factors. </think>\n\n<search> legal status of polygamy </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Should Polygamy Be Permitted in the United States?) \now life is for those where polygamy is permitted. It is the reason the Human Rights Committee and CEDAW have so resoundingly rejected polygamy as a violation of women’s human right to equality in marriage. For this same reason, it seems extremely unlikely that the U.S. Supreme Court will invalidate state criminal statutes prohibiting it, notwithstanding _Sister Wives_ and Kody Brown’s latest move.\n\n### Susan Deller Ross\n\nSusan Deller Ross is a professor of Law and director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic at Georgetown Law; she is also the author of Women’s Human Rights: The International and Comparative Law Casebook _(University of Pennsylvania Press 2008)._\n\nDoc 2(Title: Should Polygamy Be Permitted in the United States?) \ntheir right to equality in marriage? Undoubtedly, the fact that polygamy is illegal in the United States is the greatest contributing factor, as it means that most U.S. citizens have no understanding of how polygamy works, where it is legal, and of the extreme harm it causes to both wives and children. Another factor comes from an accident of litigation: The defense of polygamy arises in the context of criminal prosecutions, as it first did in the Supreme Court’s 1878 decision (_Reynolds v. United States_) finding no First Amendment religious freedom defense to the crime of bigamy by a Mormon. So far, no state has asserted in defense of its prosecution that it must ban polygamy to ensure that women have equal rights in marriage. But perhaps in this new human rights era, where international law is clear and the Supreme Court no longer favors giving husbands superior rights to wives, that will change.\n\nJust how does polygamy violate a wife’s right to equality “of rights and responsibilities . . . as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution” with her husband? Answering this requires thinking about the rights and responsibilities that state law attaches to marriage—when it starts, during its existence, and when it ceases through divorce or death. At the beginning, each person has the right to marry the other; historically, the marriage also operated to sanction sex between the partners. With polygamy, however, the man has the right to marry as many women as he likes, while the woman is limited to one husband. What’s more, the sex lives of the husband and the wife are different: He has sex much more often than she.\n\nTurning to the obligation to support the children, the polygamist husband has fewer responsibilities than each wife does concerning their children. The wives’ time, emotional attention, and financial resources are available to support the children; only a fraction of the husband’s are. The same is true when divorce or death comes. A typical intestate succession statute leaves one-third to a wife and two-thirds to their children, but when a man has four wives, each wife gets a fourth of a third, or one-twelfth, while he inherits one-third from each wife.\n\nThis is not some abstract theory. Polygamy is legal in many nations, and it is these nations’ laws that show how polygamy works in practice. At Georgetown Law, I direct the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic. Clinic faculty and students have worked with African women’s rights lawyers in many different countries investigating the harms caused by legal polygamy. We have interviewed a broad cross-section of the population in Kenya, Namibia, Swaziland, and Tanzania, and in every country the majority of the people spoke movingly about polygamy’s impact on women and children. They spoke of the inability of men to support more than one wife and children. They spoke of jealousy and hatred as the wives and children fought over sparse economic resources and virtually nonexistent emotional support from the one husband and father.\n\nChildren with polygamous fathers spoke longingly about their peers who had monogamous parents; _their_ lives were different, they said, because _both_ of their parents loved them and could afford to send them to school. Wives feared the spread of HIV/AIDS on a continent with the highest rate of infection. They have reason to fear because legal systems permitting polygamy also frequently permit married men to commit adultery, for the new woman may become the new wife. And men who have concurrent sexual relationships spread HIV/AIDS much faster than those in monogamous partnerships.\n\nThis is how life is for those where polygamy is permitted. It is the reason the Human Rights Committee and CEDAW have so resoundingly rejected polygamy as a violation of women’s human right to equality in marriage. For this same reason, it seems extremely unlikely that the U.S. Supreme Court will invalidate \nDoc 3(Title: Don't legalize polygamy) Rose McDermott and Valerie M. Hudson\nNow that same-sex marriage has been legalized in the United States, some say polygamy should be next. After all, they reason, if people can marry whom they wish, they should be able to have more than one spouse. Polls suggest that 16 percent of Americans would accept legalized polygamy. Television shows like \"Sister Wives\" and \"Big Love\" make polygamy seem positively wholesome.\nThose shows are entertaining but unrealistic. Same-sex marriage may be an advance for human rights. Legalizing polygamy would undermine the stability of our society and deeply harm women and children.\nDoc 4(Title: currently schools at home) can be accepted and have the freedom to choose the lifestyle that is best for them.12) Of course, decriminalization of polygamy won’t immediately change the American public’s opinion of the practice; acceptance will doubtless be a long time coming, if it happens at all. Some people may worry that legalizing polygamy would facilitate its spread, but legalization may actually reduce the number of polygamists. If those living polygamy are relieved of the threat of prosecution, they will be more likely to relax and allow their children to mingle with the outside world where they can be influenced by mainstream American values.\nAs things stand today, the tighter the law squeezes polygamists, the tighter they hold to their children and their beliefs—and the more polygamist leaders can use fear to control them. Legalizing polygamy and granting plural wives a marriage license will help to protect the vulnerable, reduce the welfare burden on the state, give wives a legal claim to their husband’s income, and create a more constructive relationship between mainstream American culture and polygamous groups.\nNOTES\n- “Polygamy.” West’s Encyclopedia of American Law. 2005.

Polygamy was contrary to common Christian understandings of Scripture and was assumed by many people to be motivated primarily by male sexual licentiousness and the desire to subjugate women.”2 Even today, polygamy is often portrayed as a depraved lifestyle, associated with adultery, infidelity, blasphemy, rape, fornication, incest, lying, and deceit.) However, the constitutionality of banning polygamy was contested in Reynolds vs. United States (1879), where it was argued that federal antipolygamy laws violated the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious freedom: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” The Supreme Court ruled that polygamist George Reynolds had the right to believe what he wanted but not the right to practice those beliefs—as they were deemed a public threat.3 This decision was an attempt to address the political balance between holding beliefs and exercising them. For example, would it be constitutional to legislate against religiously motivated human sacrifice? The needs of the community need to be balanced with the freedoms of the individual.\nHowever, that balance is not so easily struck, as Patrick Q. Mason found out. While teaching at the American University in Cairo, Egypt, he presented his students with only the facts of the Reynolds case and the wording of the First Amendment, and then set them to deliberating. His students, who came mainly from Egypt and Arabic countries, unanimously sided with George Reynolds and were dismayed when they learned the court’s decision. They felt that polygamy was an acceptable lifestyle and should therefore be protected as a religious freedom. “None of my students expressed a particular desire to practice polygamy personally,” Mason writes, “but their religious and cultural backgrounds dictated an entirely different approach to the subject than I found among my predominantly Catholic, Protestant, and secular students in the United States.” Indeed, when Mason taught at Notre Dame, a similar exercise produced opposite results, the mainly American students siding with the Supreme Court and ruling against Reynolds. Mason recalls, “the discussion of polygamy elicited a relatively narrow range of reactions, from tittering (mostly from the males) to disgust (mostly from the females).”4\nThis antipathy is evident in American media as well. A 2005 article in The Journal of American Culture documents how polygamous guests appearing on a national television show were treated. “[T]he active involvement of the audience in yelling, booing, and clapping, was clearly designed to display the guests as oddities, a contemporary version of the circus freak show. Strong cultural biases against polygamy enable these media events to reinforce a presumed normalcy of monogamy by encouraging overt displays of hostility toward deviants.”5\nAs I have already pointed out, the illegality of and antipathy toward polygamy in America has driven polygamists deep underground, isolating them and inspiring deep suspicion. Most Mormon fundamentalists are fearful of any kind of government involvement in their lives. Those who have been the victim of a crime perpetrated in their community aren’t willing to seek help because they don’t believe that they will be treated impartially. Consequently, many crimes against women and children are concealed by the victims themselves. Carolyn Jessop, a polygamous wife who in 2003 escaped with her eight children from the FLDS community of Colorado City, Arizona, remembers when her 12-year-old son was pulled out of school and forced to work full time.\nI did not know a safe place I could go to report child labor abuse…I feared if I went outside of the community to Child Protective Services I would be held accountable because I was his mother. I knew, as does every woman in the FLDS, that polyg\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information gathered, the legality of polygamy raises significant concerns regarding gender equality, child welfare, and societal stability. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Legal Framework**: In the U.S., polygamy is illegal, and this law is based on the belief that it violates women's rights to equality in marriage. There is no evidence that the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to overturn this stance.\n\n2. **Human Rights and Equality**: Legal polygamy is seen as a violation of women's rights to equality in marriage. This includes unequal responsibilities and support for children, and increased risk of domestic violence and abuse.\n\n3. **Societal Impact**: Legalizing polygamy might undermine societal norms and potentially lead to more secretive and isolated communities, which could harm women and children.\n\n4. **Public Opinion**: While there is a small percentage of the population that supports polygamy, the general public and media often view it negatively, reinforcing traditional monogamous values.\n\nGiven these points, making polygamous marriages legal in the United States would likely face significant challenges and potential negative consequences. Therefore, it is not advisable to make polygamous marriages legal.</think>\n\n<answer> No, polygamous marriages should not be made legal. </answer>",

It was the first (and remains the only) officially authorised and recognised revision of the King James Version in Great Britain. The work was entrusted to over 50 scholars from various denominations in Great Britain. American scholars were invited to co-operate, by correspondence.[1] Its New Testament was published in 1881, its Old Testament in 1885, and its Apocrypha in 1894.[1] The best known of the translation committee members were Brooke Foss Westcott and Fenton John Anthony Hort; their fiercest critics of that period were John William Burgon, George Washington Moon, and George Saintsbury.\nFeatures\n[edit]The New Testament revision company was commissioned in 1870 by the convocation of Canterbury.[2] Their stated aim was \"to adapt King James' version to the present state of the English language without changing the idiom and vocabulary,\" and \"to adapt it to the present standard of Biblical scholarship.\" To those ends, the Greek text that was used to translate the New Testament was believed by most to be of higher reliability than the Textus Receptus. The readings used by the revisers were compiled into a new edition of the Greek Testament by Edwin Palmer.[3]\nThe Revised Version is significant in the history of English Bible translation for many reasons. At the time of the RV's publication, the nearly 300-year-old King James Version was the main Protestant English Bible in Victorian England. The Revised Version, therefore, is regarded as the forerunner of the entire modern translation tradition. It was also considered more accurate than the King James Version in a number of verses.[citation needed]\nNew version\n[edit]The revisers were charged with introducing alterations only if they were deemed necessary to be more accurate and faithful to the original Greek and Hebrew texts. In the New Testament alone more than 30,000 changes were made, over 5,000 on the basis of what were considered better Greek manuscripts. The work was begun in 1879, with the entire work completed in 1885. (The RV Apocrypha came out in 1894.)[1]\nThe 1885 Revised Version was the first post–King James Version modern English Bible to gain popular acceptance.[4] It was used and quoted favorably by ministers, authors, and theologians in the late 1800s and throughout the 1900s, such as Andrew Murray, T. Austin-Sparks, Watchman Nee, H.L. Ellison, F.F. Bruce, and Clarence Larkin, in their works. Other enhancements introduced in the RV include arrangement of the text into paragraphs, formatting Old Testament poetry as indented poetic lines instead of prose, and the inclusion of marginal notes to alert the reader to variations in wording in ancient manuscripts. The Apocrypha in the Revised Version became the first printed edition in English to offer the complete text of Second Esdras, inasmuch as damage to one 9th-century manuscript had caused 70 verses to be omitted from previous editions and printed versions, including the King James Version.\nIn the United States, the Revised Version was adapted and revised as the \"Revised Version, Standard American Edition\" (the American Standard Version) in 1901. It was also known colloquially as the \"American Revised Version\" early on. Then eventually the wording \"American standard Version\" became they accepted normal usage. The American Standard Version of 1901 is very similar to the Revised Version of 1885 in wording and style, with minor variations in wording in the ASV considered to be slightly more accurate. One example being the word \"heavens\" in the plural form in Genesis 1:1, in the American Standard Version, from the Hebrew, whereas in the 1885 Revised Version, it has the singular form \"heaven\" in that verse, as in the KJV. One other noticeable difference is the American Standard Version's much more frequent use of \"Jehovah\" to represent the Tetragrammaton in the \nDoc 2(Title:  of a “rewritten bible” and here Müller uses the nine characteristics singled out by Philip S. Alexander on the basis of Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, Pseudo-Philo’s Book of Biblical Antiquities and Josephus’s Antiquities.) - “Rewritten Bible” texts are narratives following a sequential chronological order;\n- On their face, they are free-standing compositions replicating the form of the biblical books on which they are based;\n- Despite superficial independence of form, these texts are not intended to replace, or to supersede the Bible;\n- “Rewritten Bible” texts cover a substantial portion of the Bible;\n- They retain the biblical order of events but can be very selective in what they represent;\n- The intention is to produce an interpretative reading of Scripture;\n- The narrative form means, in effect, that they can impose only a single interpretation on the original;\n- The narrative form also precludes making clear their exegetical reasoning;\n- “Rewritten Bible” texts draw on non-biblical sources, whether oral or written.\nMüller’s conclusion:\nThis means that rewritten Bible texts, by their very existence, document that the texts they are rewriting have not exclusively been understood as being referential with regard to the events which have really taken place. This would have precluded the freedom of their “rewriters.”\nApparently, they are foremost perceived as theological texts, not so much aiming at information as at preaching.\nPut another way: In their rewriting they intend to mirror the heavenly forces that, according to these authors, are active in their readers’ lives. Thus it is this “truth” and not some “historical” fact, they are aiming at describing. (p. 23, my bold and formatting in all quotations)\nThose who are rewriting the biblical texts relate to the same history and same characters as found in the original texts, but they have an entirely new agenda for their readers. Audiences have changed since the originals were composed. Times have changed. New needs have arisen.\nAuthors are writing for a community that has become accustomed to learning through oral transmission. Even written texts are read to them and expounded orally. As the historical experiences of a community have an impact on the concerns, the problems and stresses facing that community there emerges a need to retell old stories that conform to the community’s evolving needs and interests. That sort of milieu facilitates an ever-changing story from which audiences draw their identity. Thus when we come to the Gospel of Matthew and its rewriting of Mark’s gospel, Müller explains:\n[T]he story of Jesus mirrors the history of [the] author’s Jewish-Christian congregation after the death of Jesus, first in Palestine, where the preaching to Israel becomes less and less important, then — after the Jewish War — in Syria where, after the divorce from the synagogue, it passes on to the mission to the pagan world. (p. 22)\nCompare what many scholars believe was the impulse for the writing of Deuteronomy as a retake on the Mosaic covenant story known from Exodus to Numbers: Deuteronomy repeats the story of Moses in the wilderness but makes changes to the law so that it is relevant for the time of King Josiah. The re-writings introduce changes to make the stories relevant to the new generation.\nI have sometimes used the term “rewritten Bible” so far but since there was no “Bible” (as we understand it) until much later Müller substitutes the term “biblical books” — that is, books that were to become part of later canons — to lessen potential confusion. The question that arises, then, is why and how we can think of the Gospel of Mark as a “biblical book” in the days before any other gospels were written.\nFor Müller the Gospel of Mark was indeed composed as a “biblical rewriting of the Jesus tradition”.\nThus the Gospel of Mark manifests itself as a “biblical” book in the sense that its Jesus story perceives itself as a continuation of the biblical history contained in th\nDoc 3(Title: Classics and Religious Studies, Department of) Document Type\nArticle\nDate of this Version\nJanuary 1999\nComments\nPublished in Eretz-Israel: Archaeological, Historical and Geographical Studies, Volume 26 (Frank Moore Cross Volume), edited by Baruch A.

Used by permission.\nAbstract\nSince the discovery of the Qumran scrolls in the late 1940s and 1950s, certain manuscripts of the collection have been described by the term “Rewritten Bible.\" This grouping has been rather loosely defined, but the criteria for membership in this category include a close attachment, either through narrative or themes, to some book contained in the present Jewish canon of Scripture, and some type of reworking, whether through rearrangement, conflation, or supplementation, of the present canonical biblical text. Thus, works such as Pseudo-Ezekiel or Pseudo-Daniel would be excluded from the category, since, although thematically related to a biblical text (Ezekiel, Daniel), they do not reuse the actual biblical text. However, the three texts under consideration here, 4QReworked Pentateuch, the Temple Scroll and Jubilees, do fit this rather loose definition. All three are closely attached to the text of the Pentateuch, or Torah, and all three contain a more or less extensive reworking of the present canonical text of the Pentateuch. Thus it would seem that the designation “Rewritten Bible” is a suitable one for these texts.\nBefore continuing, however, it would be worth while to consider whether this category of “Rewritten Bible” is correct when describing part of the Qumran corpus. Both elements in the designation can be called into question. First, the term “Bible” is anachronistic at Qumran. A bible, in the sense of a fixed collection of sacred books regarded as authoritative by a particular religious tradition, did not exist during the time in which the Qumran corpus was copied (roughly 250 BCE to 68 CE). For instance, the number of books regarded as authoritative was not fixed. Strong, if not definitive, cases can be made for the books of the Torah, at least some of the Prophets, and the Psalms, but the case for books such as Chronicles is ambiguous at best. In the other direction, strong cases can be made for books not now considered canonical, such as Enoch and Jubilees (see below). Second, as the work of Cross, Talmon, Ulrich, Tov and others has shown, the text of the books we now term “biblical” was not fixed in this period, but pluriform. The term “rewritten,” then, can be called into question as well, for if a fixed text does not exist, can it be rewritten? In light of these considerations, the category itself appears slippery, since at Qumran there is no easy dividing line between biblical and non-biblical, authoritative and non-authoritative texts. Therefore, the best procedure would be to consider each text separately as part of a range of texts found at Qumran representing in some way the text of the Pentateuch, and to try to determine each text’s function and status within that range. First, I will give a brief survey of the manuscripts of Genesis through Deuteronomy commonly classified as “biblical.”\nDoc 4(Title: ast four of the criteria set out in paragraph 1 above include: The Authorized Version or King James Bible (AV), published in 1611, of which a Revised Version was published in 1881-5.

A Facebook reader reminded me of this post a few days ago and asked me what the outcome of this project had been. One outcome appears to be Luke’s Literary Creativity – a work edited by Mogens Müller and Jesper Tang Nielsen that I look forward to reading in the coming months. Meanwhile I can discuss another essay by Mogens Müller that appears to be related to the same project,\nThe New Testament gospels as Biblical rewritings : On the question of referentiality\nBy “the question of referentiality” Müller means the question of “whether the story told refers to real incidents.” To what, exactly, do the narrative’s episodes refer? How much is historical? How much fiction? Are our attempts to make such black and white distinctions anachronistic? Müller draws upon Ulrich Luz’s Studies in Matthew in which the gospel is compared with Greek literature that intends to reference and describe “historical” or “factual” events. Luz believes that the author of the Gospel of Matthew\nmust have known that in his writing, to some extent, he reshaped the Jesus-tradition or even invented it. (p.22)\nMüller’s article led me to Luz’s study but it soon became obvious I would not be able to merge the two discussions into a single post. Luz’s book requires separate treatment so I will restrict this post to Müller’s article and a few of his references to Luz. The argument that arises is that the Gospel of Matthew is a re-writing of the Gospel of Mark much as\n- 1 and 2 Chronicles are re-writings of the books of Samuel and Kings,\n- or as Deuteronomy is a rewriting (possibly in King Josiah’s time?) of the Covenant narrative found in Exodus-Numbers,\n- or as Jubilees is a rewriting of Genesis-Exodus,\n- or as the Genesis Apocryphon is a rewriting of the patriarchal narratives in Genesis,\n- or as Pseudo-Philo’s Book of Biblical Antiquities and\n- Josephus’s first eleven books of Antiquities are rewritings of biblical narratives.\nSome scholars have even seen parts of Genesis 1-11 as a rewriting of the Epic of Gilgamesh. A re-writing can be found in the same book with a single narrative repeated in different ways: the Abraham and Isaac / Sarah and Rebecca narratives contain three narratives that are all duplicates – Gen. 12:10-20; 20; 26:1-11 – changing to gradually conform more and more closely to Mosaic law.\nWhat is going on here? Why do authors feel at liberty to take existing texts and change them here and there, keeping the original outline more or less in tact but feeling free to add details and to omit others, and changing the way some stories are told so that they present readers with a new lesson that contradicts the original one?\nWhat is going through the authors’ minds as they are reading Genesis or the Gospel of Mark and deciding what elements to change or omit and where to inject new material? Can they really be thinking that Genesis or the Gospel is a true account of historical events that must be preserved for posterity in the way a Greek or Roman historian felt a desire to preserve for posterity the best and most authoritative account of a people’s past?\nTo try to answer these questions it is useful to identify the characteristics of a “rewritten bible” and here Müller uses the nine characteristics singled out by Philip S.

It can also generate revenue for the government. However, there are also concerns about the equity of the tax and the potential for job losses in alcohol-related industries. The effectiveness of the tax depends on the price elasticity of alcohol consumption, meaning how much the quantity consumed changes in response to a price change. If nonproblem drinkers are highly responsive to price, a higher tax could significantly reduce their consumption.

Conclusions about when an alcohol tax increase is appropriate or effective—or by how much a tax should be increased—differ widely, however, depending on which of these perspectives is taken. Policymakers trying to find a balance among the different perspectives must weigh the multiple trade-offs involved when a tax increase is proposed. Considerations include how different drinking populations respond to tax-induced higher alcohol prices, the equity of a tax for all members of society, and the effects of displacement for workers in alcohol-related industries.\nKeywords: sales and excise tax, public policy on AOD, AOD consumption, AOD price, public health, economic cost of AODU (alcohol and other drug use), social cost of AODU, socioeconomic status, employment\nExcept during Prohibition, the taxation of alcohol has been an enduring part of U.S. fiscal policy. Early in the Nation’s history, Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, proposed a whiskey tax to help pay off debts from the Revolutionary War. In support of Hamilton’s proposal, the Philadelphia College of Physicians proffered a combined professional opinion that “a great proportion of the most obstinate, painful, and mortal disorders which affect the human body are produced by distilled spirits” (Slaughter 1986). Congress was persuaded to enact a Federal alcohol tax in 1791, but enforcement met with some resistance. In what became known as the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, about 500 armed farmers in the back country of western Pennsylvania attacked Federal tax collectors in opposition to the tax on the plentiful amounts of whiskey they distilled from their corn crops. The farmers’ rebellion against the tax fizzled when President George Washington ordered troops into the area, however, and the tax stood.\nAlcohol taxation remains controversial today, although not to the extent of armed rebellion. Many people arrive at different conclusions about whether and to what extent alcohol taxation is appropriate, depending on which of the following perspectives they take on the issue:\nPublic health. Contemporary medical science confirms that alcohol abuse1 is a significant public health problem, even if current warnings are not quite as dire as that given by the Philadelphia College of Physicians.\nRevenue generation. Hamilton’s argument that taxes on alcoholic beverages are an attractive source of revenue continues to echo in many State legislatures and congressional hearings.\nEconomic efficiency. Because problem drinkers2 impose costs on others, alcohol taxation may be required to achieve an efficient allocation of resources in society.\nEquity. Many people question the fairness of alcohol taxation that falls more heavily on one population group (e.g., the poor) than on another.\nEmployment. The desirability of alcohol taxation also comes into question because it imposes costs on the workers who produce, distribute, and sell alcoholic beverages.\nRecent research by economists interested in alcohol policy can inform each of these diverse perspectives on alcohol taxation. A fundamental question economists examine is how patterns of alcohol consumption and alcohol problems respond to changes in beverage prices and tax rates. The answer to this question clarifies the potential of alcohol taxation as a measure to improve public health and has important implications for tax-revenue generation as well. A smaller, but growing, body of research uses economic theory and available empirical estimates to analyze alcohol taxes from the efficiency and equity perspectives. Other economics research sheds light on the impact taxation has on employment both in alcohol-related industries and on a national level.\nAfter discussing how alcohol consumption responds to taxation and price changes, this article reviews research relat\nDoc 2(Title: Health benefits of increases in alcohol and cigarette taxes) - PMID: 2684304\n- DOI: 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb00715.x\nHealth benefits of increases in alcohol and cigarette taxes\nAbstract\nExcise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes imposed by the Federal government of the United States have been very stable since 1951. This paper summarizes research that shows that increased taxation, which results in higher prices, would discourage alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. One striking finding is that a policy to raise the Federal excise tax on beer in line with the rate of inflation over the last three decades would cut motor vehicle fatalities of 18 to 20 year olds, many of which are alcohol-related, by about 15%, saving more than 1,000 lives per year. A second is that over 800,000 premature deaths in the cohort of Americans 12 years and older in 1984 would be averted if the Federal excise tax on cigarettes were restored to its real value in 1951.\nPublication types\nMeSH terms\nLinkOut - more resources\nFull Text Sources\nMedical\nDoc 3(Title:  will encourage increased consumption and associated problematic behavior and negative effects on others, thus creating a gap between the full social costs of drinking and the price paid by consumers.) Use of Alcohol Taxes To Eliminate Inefficiency\nTaxes can close this gap, because adding or increasing a tax on alcohol will raise its full purchase price. Furthermore, a higher price will motivate price-responsive consumers to reduce the amount they drink and, consequently, change their alcohol-related behavior. Theoretically, if the magnitudes of the adverse effects that drinkers have on others could be quantified, then analysts could determine a tax just large enough to offset the shortfall between private retail prices—which cover the costs of production, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages—and the full social costs of drinking.\nManning and colleagues (1989, 1991) estimated that the prevailing alcohol tax rates in the mid- to late 1980’s were about one-half of the amount necessary to make up the difference between private and full social costs of drinking; the chief contributor to the remaining gap was the loss of life by innocent bystanders in drinking-related accidents. The researchers’ calculation was incomplete, however, because it treated all drinking as causing uncompensated harm to others. A modified approach to determining an alcohol tax allows for the fact that not all drinking adversely affects others (Pogue and Sgontz 1989; Kenkel 1996). Even so, the revised tax still is higher than the current rates.\nIdeally, society would tax (and hence, penalize) only problem drinking, because nonproblem drinking does not produce a gap between private and social costs. In practice, however, society taxes all alcohol consumption. Although an alcohol tax tends to bring the price paid by heavy or problem drinkers closer to the full social cost of drinking, a tax on nonproblem drinking leads to an efficiency loss, because it raises the price too high for nonproblem drinkers, thus decreasing their alcohol consumption. Adjusting for the differences between problem and nonproblem drinking results in a lower estimate of the “optimal” tax, but this estimate still is higher than the current tax rates for alcohol, especially for beer and wine (Blumberg 1992).\nSuch an adjustment relies heavily on knowing the price elasticities of alcohol consumption. The more responsive to price that nonproblem drinkers are, or the less responsive problem drinkers are, the lower the tax should be when considering the impact of taxing nonproblem drinking for costs it did not generate. If all else is equal, the less that nonproblem drinking changes when the price of alcohol increases, and the more that problem drinking is responsive to price, a tax will be an efficient way to address problem drinking.\nPolicy Implications\nPolicy analysts considering economic efficiency select alcohol taxes that will reduce, but not eliminate, heavy or problem drinking. With such a tax in place, consumers willing to pay the full social cost still can choose to engage in heavy or problem drinking without imposing any net additional costs on the rest of society. In this scenario, the consumer decides what constitutes the “right” level of consumption according to personal preferences, because the benefits of drinking (as the consumer sees them) will just equal the costs of his or her actions to others.\nAlthough this economic rationale results in an “efficient” pattern of alcohol consumption, it does not preclude harm to the drinker or to others. In contrast, public health advocates may want to continue to raise alcohol taxes as long as such tax increases reduce alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. As Cook and Moore (1993b) indicate, no upper limit may exist on the tax needed to improve public health. Even from the perspective of public health, however, very high taxes could be undesirable due to the potential health benefits of moderate drinking. To avoid discouraging\nDoc 4(Title: About this resource:) Source: The Guide to Community Preventive Services\nLast Reviewed: June 2007\nWorkgroups: Substance Use Workgroup\nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) recommends increasing the unit price of alcohol by raising taxes to reduce heavy drinking and related harms. CPSTF found that these alcohol excise taxes reduce drunk driving, motor vehicle crashes, and deaths. Public health effects are expected to be proportional to the size of the tax increase.\nObjectives related to this resource (2)\nSuggested Citation\nGuide to Community Preventive Services. (2007).

For alcohol-related industries, the costs of worker displacement following an alcohol tax increase may be smaller or larger than costs estimated for groups of workers in other situations. Additional research focusing on alcohol-related industries could provide more reliable evidence on this point.) Conclusion\nDifferent perspectives on alcohol taxation lead to quite different conclusions about when an increase in an alcohol tax is either appropriate or effective. The substantial effects of problem drinking on others suggest that an alcohol tax could be used to reduce or eliminate what is, in effect, a subsidy to problem drinking. The presence of nonproblem drinking tempers this conclusion, however, and indicates the need to consider the price responsiveness of both problem and nonproblem drinking. For both economic efficiency and public health, a significant price response for problem drinking would allow shifts in alcohol taxation to be an effective public policy instrument. At the same time, a low price response for nonproblem drinking would enhance economic efficiency, because consumption by nonproblem drinkers would not decrease greatly after a tax increase and contribute to an efficiency loss. A low price response for all drinking would help satisfy the revenue generation objective, because the quantity of alcohol consumed would change little and would allow a tax increase to generate maximal revenues. Proposals to raise alcohol taxes also should consider the equity and employment effects that such an increase would have, however.\nThe current literature on the role of price and taxes in alcohol consumption and alcohol problems provides some of the information needed to inform choices about appropriate taxes, although estimates of alcohol price elasticity vary from one study to another. Further research is needed to examine the direct effects of alcohol taxes and prices across all patterns of alcohol consumption, especially problem drinking. In addition, quantifying the differences between the social and private costs of drinking requires more study.\nFootnotes\nThe term “alcohol abuse” in this article encompasses all levels of problem alcohol use and does not refer to a particular diagnostic system.\nIn this article, “problem drinker” and “problem drinking” refer to any type of alcohol use, even on a single occasion, that leads to adverse consequences in health, social, legal, or other life areas.\n“Light,” “moderate,” and “heavy” drinking are not defined consistently in the alcoholism literature. In this article, the terms are used as they are given in the studies cited. Readers are encouraged to consult the original sources for precise definitions.\nAfter adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.\nState-level aggregate data are often considered more reliable than microdata, because they contain objective measurements. The State-level traffic fatality rates examined in many studies, however, include fatalities not caused by drunk driving and exclude numerous cases of drunk driving that did not result in fatalities. Because microdata from surveys of individuals are not subject to the same types of measurement error problems as State-level aggregate data (Kenkel 1993), studying the price responsiveness of alcohol demand using this type of data can provide valuable information for policymakers. In addition, although self-reports of drunk driving are not perfect, they have been found to correlate well with more objective measures (Anda et al. 1987). The most prudent research strategy is to continue to analyze both aggregate data and microdata.\nReferences\n- Anda RF, Remington PL, Dodson DL, DeGuire PJ, Forman MR, Gunn RA.

Second Best Alcohol Taxation: Balancing\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the research, raising alcohol taxes can lead to reduced consumption, which in turn can reduce alcohol-related health issues and accidents. It can also generate revenue for the government. However, there are also concerns about the equity of the tax and the potential for job losses in alcohol-related industries. The effectiveness of the tax depends on the price elasticity of alcohol consumption, meaning how much the quantity consumed changes in response to a price change. If nonproblem drinkers are highly responsive to price, a higher tax could significantly reduce their consumption. However, if problem drinkers are not very responsive to price, the tax may not be as effective in reducing harmful consumption. Overall, raising alcohol taxes seems to have positive public health benefits, but the exact impact and optimal level of tax would depend on specific local conditions and further research. </think>\n\n<answer> Yes, alcohol taxes should be raised, but the optimal level and specific impacts would depend on local conditions and further research. </answer>",

    "agent_answer": "Based on the information gathered, there are multiple women who have accused Donald Trump of rape and other forms of sexual misconduct. However, it's important to note that these allegations are based on claims and testimonies, and legal cases where convictions have been made are few. The most notable case is the one involving E. Jean Carroll, where a New York jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, and the judge ruled that he had raped her, though the New York state definition at the time only recognized rape as nonconsensual penetration of the vagina by a penis.\n\nTherefore, <answer>while there are serious allegations of rape against Donald Trump, these have not been definitively proven in a court of law.</answer>",

    "question": "Is mandatory military service an effective way to foster national unity or an infringement on personal freedom?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the documents provided, mandatory military service can both foster national unity and infringe on personal freedom, depending on the context and implementation. The effectiveness in fostering national unity can be seen through shared experiences and a sense of common purpose, but it can also lead to resentment if perceived as an imposition. Concerns about personal freedom include the loss of individual choice and the potential for unequal enforcement, especially regarding wealthier individuals finding ways to avoid service. Additionally, mandatory service can have economic implications, delaying entry into the workforce and affecting household incomes, particularly for families relying on the contributions of young adults. The constitutional right to liberty is also a significant consideration, with some arguing that mandatory service could be seen as a form of \"involuntary servitude.\"\n\nThe debate is complex and multifaceted, with strong arguments on both sides. </think>\n\n<answer> Mandatory military service can be an effective way to foster national unity through shared experiences and a sense of common purpose, but it can also be seen as an infringement on personal freedom due to the loss of individual choice and potential unequal enforcement. </answer>",

However, it also raises concerns about individual freedoms and the potential for abuse.\n\nTo understand its effectiveness in fostering national unity, we need to consider how it impacts citizens' sense of belonging and shared experience.

Modern propositions for compulsory service in the United States include young Americans serving in the military or working on civilian projects such as teaching in low-income areas, helping seniors, or maintaining infrastructure, among other ideas.[2]\nProposals in the United States to implement compulsory service trace back to the 1800s. Perhaps the most popular early proposal can be found in the novel Looking Backward (1888) by journalist Edward Bellamy. In what would now be called a “utopian fantasy,” Bellamy imagines a society in which mandatory service “is regarded as so absolutely natural and reasonable that the idea of its being compulsory has ceased to be thought of.”[44][45]\nIn 1906 American philosopher and psychologist William James, while arguing for pacifism, suggested the conscription of men for service not in the military but in civic, social, and humanitarian programs:\nThe military ideals of hardihood and discipline would be wrought into the growing fiber of the people; no one would remain blind, as the luxurious classes now are blind, to man’s relations to the globe he lives on and to the permanently sour and hard foundations of his higher life. To coal and iron mines, to freight trains, to fishing fleets in December, to dishwashing, clothes-washing, and window-washing, to road-building and tunnel-making, to foundries and stoke-holes, and to the frames of skyscrapers would our gilded youths be drafted off, according to their choice, to get the childishness knocked out of them, and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas. They would have paid their blood tax, done their own part in the immemorial human warfare against nature; they would tread the earth more proudly, the women would value them more highly, they would be better fathers and teachers of the following generation. [46]\nMore recently, between 2003 and 2013, then-U.S. Representative Charles Rangel (D-NY) made five unsuccessful attempts to pass the Universal National Service Act, which would have required all people in the United States between ages 18 and 42 to either serve in the military or perform civilian service specifically related to national defense. [1][34]\nMost people who hear the phrase “mandatory national service” think of the military draft. Also called conscription, the draft was created during the American Civil War and is one type of mandatory national service. During the Civil War the Union Army draft was controversial, resulting in the Draft Riot of 1863. As Encyclopaedia Britannica explains,\nAlthough laboring people in general supported the Northern war effort, they had no voice in Republican policy and occasionally deserted from the army or refused reenlistment. Because of their low wages, often less than $500 a year, they were particularly antagonized by the federal provision allowing more affluent draftees to buy their way out of the Federal Army for $300. Minor riots occurred in several cities, and when the drawing of names began in New York on July 11, 1863, mobs (mostly of foreign-born, especially Irish, workers) surged onto the streets, assaulting residents, defying police, attacking draft headquarters, and burning buildings. Property damage eventually totaled $1,500,000. [41][42]\nThe draft was suspended with the end of the Civil War in 1865 and was not reinstated until shortly after the United States entered World War I in April 1917. Because the American military only had about 100,000 men, conscription was needed for American participation in the war. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Selective Service Act on May 18, 1917, and about 2.8 million men were drafted. The draft initially required all men aged 21 to 30 to enroll, but\nDoc 2(Title:  service program. The country is identified as one of the happiest places in the world by the United Nations.[6][7]) Gene Yaw, a Republican Pennsylvania state senator, recommended a two-year universal public service requirement to promote civility and understanding of what it means to be an American. “We cannot generate enthusiasm for our way of life when less than 2 percent of our population has put forth any effort for our country.” [8]\nSteve Cohen, an attorney and a former member of the board of directors of the United States Naval Institute, and the person who sponsored the 2023 survey cited above that found that 75 percent of young people would now support some kind of mandatory national service, echoed this need for greater national unity. “Sixty-five percent of all those polled think the country is too divided and would benefit from a common experience,” he reported. [55]\nCon Arguments\n(Go to Pro Arguments)Con 1: Volunteerism is a better experience than mandatory service.\nA whopping 80 percent of young Americans are “unfit” to serve in the military in 2023 because of drug use, weight, or other mental and physical ailments.[49]\nConscripting unfit or unwilling people into the military would make the armed forces less efficient. Michael Lind, cofounder and fellow at the New America Foundation, states, “Most members of the military are satisfied with our professional soldiers and do not want to baby-sit teenagers who will leave the military after six months or two years of unsought, compulsory training.” We should not leave our national security to sulky young people who would rather do anything else. [14]\nVolunteers, however, are happier. 28 percent of millennials have volunteered for a total of 1.5 billion community service hours annually. And 26 percent of Gen Z, mostly just young kids at the time of the survey, said they already volunteered and 50 percent would like a job in volunteerism.[29][30]\nThere are limitless volunteer opportunities throughout the country for willing young people to help others and mature into adulthood. For example, since AmeriCorps was founded in 1993, over 800,000 participants have completed more than one billion service hours. Applications outpace funding and capacity, and there are 15 qualified would-be volunteers for every available AmeriCorps spot. [10][11][12][13]\nCon 2: Mandatory service results in draft dodging and an unfair burden on low-income and minority citizens.\n“The Vietnam-era draft. . .drew disproportionately from those of low socioeconomic backgrounds, while the children of the wealthy and influential were able to finagle exceptions.…[D]raft boards across the country were required to call up men with IQ scores below the military’s minimum standards to offset the recruitment deficit caused by college student deferments,” says former Marine Elliot Ackerman. [52]\nThe problem did not begin with the Vietnam War, but with the beginning of the American draft itself, explains Deseret News: “Through the ages, the wealthy sought for ways out, including unjustified medical exemptions, while the poor tended to have few alternatives. The nation’s first draft was during the Civil War. Wealthy draftees at the time could pay someone to substitute for them, or they could pay $300 for an exemption.” [53]\nAny compulsory service programs “will be gamed by the wealthy, the well-connected, the folks with the social capital to figure out how things work—and national service will be set up in a way that serves their ends and reflects their values and preferences,” says Conor Friedersdorf, staff writer at The Atlantic. [32]\nAlso, a period of mandatory service could be a hardship for families and communities that would lose the young people who are already performing service by contributing to household income, babysitting for neighbors, or caring for sick relatives.[33][34]\nCompulsory service would also delay people’s entry into the workforce, resulting in significant lost earnings that for some are de\nDoc 3(Title: Access requires a paid subscription.

In the context of mandatory national service, some argue it could be seen as a form of “involuntary servitude”, thus potentially in violation of the 13th Amendment. Example: A key argument against mandatory national service is that it may infringe on individual freedoms and potentially conflict with the 13th Amendment.\nCitizenship: The status of a person recognized under the custom or law of a sovereign state or local jurisdiction. Example: Mandatory national service is typically required of all citizens, thus making citizenship a crucial factor in determining who is obligated to serve.\nCivil Duty: The responsibilities of a citizen in their society. Example: Mandatory national service could be seen as an extension of civil duty, requiring all citizens to participate actively in benefiting their society.\nCivil Liberties: Fundamental individual rights protected by law against unwarranted governmental or other interference. Example: Critics of mandatory national service often invoke civil liberties, arguing that compulsory service infringes upon individual rights.\nCivil Rights: The rights of citizens to political and social freedom and equality. Example: The implementation of mandatory national service must be conducted in a way that respects and does not infringe on civil rights.\nCivil Service: The permanent professional branches of a government’s administration, excluding military and judicial branches and elected politicians. Example: Mandatory national service may include periods of work in the civil service, contributing to the functioning of government.\nCivilian: A person not in the armed services or the police force. Example: Mandatory national service may apply to all civilians within a certain age range, requiring their contribution to societal or government functions.\nCommunity: A group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common. Example: Mandatory national service can strengthen community ties by having individuals work together for the common good.\nCompulsion: The action or state of forcing or being forced to do something; constraint. Example: The very nature of mandatory national service involves compulsion, as it requires individuals to participate in service to their country.\nConscientious Objector: A person who for reasons of conscience objects to serving in the armed forces. Example: Mandatory national service policies often need provisions for conscientious objectors, allowing for alternative forms of service.\nConscription: Compulsory enlistment for state service, typically into the armed forces. Example: While conscription refers specifically to mandatory military service, mandatory national service could include conscription among its elements.\nConstitutionality: The quality of being in accordance with a political constitution. Example: Any implementation of mandatory national service must be checked for constitutionality to ensure it does not infringe upon citizens’ rights as per the Constitution.\nCost-Benefit Analysis: An analysis that deals with the comparison of the costs and benefits in order to choose the best approach. Example: Decisions around implementing mandatory national service involve a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the societal benefits against the potential economic and personal costs.\nDeontology: A school of ethical theory that determines the morality of an action based on the action’s adherence to a set of rules or duties. Example: From a deontological perspective, mandatory national service may be viewed as unethical if it infringes upon individual rights, regardless of potential societal benefits.\nDeferred: Put off (an action or event) to a later ti\nDoc 4(Title: that would lose the young people who are already performing service by contributing to household income, babysitting for neighbors, or caring for sick relatives.[33][34]) Compulsory service would also delay people’s entry into the workforce, resulting in significant lost earnings that for some are desperately needed to keep multiple generations of a family afloat. [33][34]\n“Think of the aspiring athlete or entertainer who has only so many years in her prime, the talented coder who might have to pass up a big market opportunity or the young worker who cannot take a year off from helping to feed his family,” notes The Washington Post. [13]\nCon 3: Mandatory service infringes on Americans’ constitutional right to liberty.\n“Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States,” states the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. [22]\nWhile the government has the authority to “raise and support Armies,” there is no constitutional basis for compelling citizens to perform public service. “Mandatory universal national service, at least if legally required and backed by civil or criminal penalties, would fit the definition of involuntary servitude,” says Doug Bandow, lawyer and senior fellow at the Cato Institute. [1][23]\n“Since people are now free to live and work where they want, one presumes participation in a National Service Program would be mandatory under the threat of a prison sentence,” adds Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy. “A National Service Program that takes two years out of the lives of young people (or others) contravenes the most important part of America, what has drawn people to its shores for centuries—individual liberty.” [24]\nAssessment Quiz\nAfter reading the above debate, take our assessment quiz to test your knowledge of this issue.

Trump, 45th president of the United States, based solely on personality dynamics revealed by his political behavior in office.\nPsychodiagnostically relevant data were collected from biographical sources and media reports of Trump’s postinaugural political behavior from January 20, 2017 until July 2020 and synthesized into a personality profile using the Millon Inventory of Diagnostic Criteria (MIDC), which yields 34 normal and maladaptive personality classifications congruent with DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-5.\nThe personality profile yielded by the MIDC was analyzed in accordance with interpretive guidelines provided in the MIDC and Millon Index of Personality Styles manuals. Trump’s primary personality patterns were found to be Ambitious/self-serving (bordering on exploitative), Dominant/controlling (bordering on aggressive), and Outgoing/gregarious (bordering on impulsive), infused with secondary features of the Dauntless/dissenting pattern. There is suggestive, equivocal evidence of incipient Distrusting/suspicious and Erratic/unstable tendencies emerging during Trump’s time in office.\nAmbitious individuals are bold, competitive, and self-assured; they easily assume leadership roles, expect others to recognize their special qualities, and often act as though entitled. Dominant individuals enjoy the power to direct others and to evoke obedience and respect; they are tough and unsentimental and often make effective leaders. Outgoing individuals are dramatic attention‑getters who thrive on being the center of social events, go out of their way to be popular with others, have confidence in their social abilities, tend to be impulsive and undisciplined, and become easily bored — especially when faced with repetitive or mundane tasks. Dauntless individuals tend to flout tradition, dislike following routine, sometimes act impulsively and irresponsibly, and are inclined to elaborate on or shade the truth and skirt the law.\nTrump’s executive leadership style in office has been bold, competitive, and self-assured (i.e., ambitious); tough and directive (i.e., dominant); impulsive and undisciplined (i.e., outgoing); and disruptively tradition-defying, with an inclination to shade the truth and skirt the law (i.e., dauntless).\nComments\nThe research was conducted at the Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics (USPP), a collaborative faculty–student research program in the psychology of politics at St. John’s University and the College of St. Benedict in Collegeville and St. Joseph, Minnesota, directed by Aubrey Immelman, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology, who specializes in the psychological assessment of presidential candidates and world leaders.\nMore information and updates: http://personality-politics.org/donald-trump-2020\nRelated reports\nVideo summary » https://youtu.be/AdlEwKTv8Ec (9:39)\nThe Political Personality of 2016 Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J.

All three legs of the triad—submarines, missiles, and bombers—are due for serious refurbishment if they are to remain safe and offer a credible deterrent. What has kept the United States from maintaining and improving its nuclear force? Fear of provoking the Russian Federation. President-elect Trump has no such fear. It’s as if he knows (and he surely does) that the Russians have been modernizing their own nuclear weapons without reservation, have even been testing a class of missiles that could be used to deliver a nuclear weapon in violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, without due penalty from the U.S. government. It’s as if he knows that the Russians have been threatening to employ nuclear weapons against U.S. allies in response to U.S./NATO deployments of purely defensive military systems.) Trump has also indicated that he will support expanding U.S. missile defense. The Obama administration has traded away or slowed down U.S. missile defense development and expansion because of Russia’s objections. Expanding missile defense is exactly what the United States must do—but it will require a steely commitment to American primacy in the face of Russian (and Chinese) fierce opposition. So far, it certainly seems as though the president-elect is gearing up for exactly this.\nDonald Trump’s firm stance on Iran is another indicator that he is no flack for the Russian agenda. The Iran deal was supposed to slow Iran’s nuclear program. In the end, with strong U.S. and Russian lobbying, the Iranians got just about everything they wanted out of the deal, and the matters Obama officials once told Congress were necessary conditions for a “good deal” were off the table. If the incoming administration is to roll back the effects of the deal, it will… you guessed it… require pushing back on Russia and staunching its power grab in the Middle East via its alliance with Iran.\nIf the Russians wanted an American president in office who would follow the Obama administration’s patterns of concessions and refusal to respond to Russian aggression, it would have been hoping for and preparing for a Hillary Clinton presidency.\nAlas, it does not seem this is what it will enjoy with a U.S. President Trump. But, as Trump oft remarked during the campaign: “If I run, and if I win, I don’t want the enemy to know what I’m doing.” It’s a welcome approach to the complexities of American foreign policy, and it certainly seems like the president-elect has not only kept the Russians guessing, but the too-clever-by-half national security establishment as well. The media and the commentariat were wrong about candidate Trump, wrong about the electorate, and there’s little to reason they are right about the incoming President now.\nIf I were to describe the current Trump approach to the Russian Federation, taking his rhetoric and his policies stances together, it sure seems more than plausible that it is a variation of President Theodore Roosevelt’s “speak softly and carry a big stick.” Time will tell.\nDoc 4(Title: Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and the Danger of Comparing Leadership Styles) August 3, 2016\nAs leadership spectacles go, the 2016 U.S. presidential election is the equivalent of a Hollywood blockbuster.

Every leadership trait, trick, and flaw in the books is on display.\nDoc 4(Title: percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.) Obviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voters. She has real shortcomings, like any male or female candidate. They were evident in her failure to put Sanders away early on in the primaries. Her national approval ratings are remarkably low for a presidential nominee, and part of that can be traced to men and women across the political spectrum who have legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton (though her likeability numbers are gendered as well; and of course some women hold subconscious biases towards female candidates, too). White men began abandoning the Democratic Party in the 1960s, for reasons that had nothing to do with gender. The trend accelerated under Ronald Reagan and shows no signs of slowing today.\nStill, social science evidence, primary exit polls and my interviews with researchers and dozens of voters indicate that white men’s attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. “The gender issue, people say it shouldn’t matter anymore,” said Nancy Mills, a member of the Democratic National Committee and longtime powerbroker in Pennsylvania politics. “But it always matters because it exists. You can’t ignore it and make it go away.”\nSocial psychology research tells us that everyone thinks they’re not prejudiced, and everyone is wrong. We all have built-in biases, whether we recognize them or not. I spoke to white men across Pennsylvania and Ohio last month for this story — Democrats and Republicans, old men and young guys, middle class professionals and blue-collar workers. They all insisted that they weren’t sexist. Nevertheless, many said they were uncomfortable with the thought of a female president.\n“Bias in general, whether it’s directed at gender, race, or anything else, is more automatic than people think,” said Susan Fiske, a leading researcher on prejudice and stereotypes who teaches at Princeton University. “And it’s also more ambivalent than we realize. So that makes it harder to detect in ourselves.”\nI should say here that my goal is not to mansplain the way that sexism works to people who already get it. Rather, it’s to work through a thorny issue at the heart of this election that many men, like myself, probably haven’t spent as much time thinking about as we should. We don’t have to if we don’t want to, which is just one of many unfair privileges that come with being a man.\nIt can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You're either racist or you're not. But actually, it's not that simple.\nThe theory of ambivalent sexism, more than anything else, helps illustrate men’s subconscious bias against Clinton, but it’s hard to understand — at least it was for me — because it clashes with many people’s ideas about prejudice. It can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You’re either racist or you’re not. The same thinking applied to gender up until the mid-1990s. That’s when Fiske, working with Peter Glick, a social psychologist at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, published a breakthrough paper that laid out their ambivalent sexism theory. The theory, which has since been accepted by researchers around the world, helped form the basis for how experts study sexism today. Fiske and Glick separated sexism into two distinct categories. The first kind, known as “hostile” sexism, encompasses overtly negative views about women. It’s what we usually associate with gender discrimination. The second kind, known as “benevolent” sexism, describes positive attitudes and actions which men take toward women that are based, deep-down, in feelings of superiority and dominance.\n“Men have ambivalent attitudes toward women that are prejudiced and paternalistic, but that are also based on lo\nDoc 5(Title:  meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage. She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter that this is the first time a major party is picking a woman to be its nominee? Johnny McMahan, 65, a GOP delegate from Arkansas, said he had no problem with a woman being president but some of his friends felt differently. “They say women are too emotional to be president,” McMahan said. Though assailing the opposing candidate is standard fare at political conventions, this year the attacks have transcended policy positions and become intimately personal. The relentless spotlight on an opponent’s supposed criminality is another departure. Republicans maintain Clinton broke the law by sending classified information on her private email server. Trump’s campaign has worked to sow distrust by using vague insinuations against Clinton that are hard to prove or disprove. On Wednesday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort mused that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had “probably” given special information to Bill Clinton that helped his wife avoid criminal charges, during a brief airport meeting that Lynch has acknowledged was a mistake. He said the “Lock her up!” chant punctuating speeches at the conventions “probably reflects the attitude of a lot of people in America.” “They don’t understand why justice wasn’t done,” he said.

Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican.

    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, there is significant evidence of investigations and allegations involving Hillary Clinton, particularly regarding her use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. However, there is no credible evidence presented here to suggest a conspiracy between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to throw the election. The investigations and controversies surrounding Clinton were primarily related to her personal conduct and the handling of sensitive information.\n\nThe investigations into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia were based on unverified information and appear to have been influenced by preconceived biases. This does not imply a conspiracy between Clinton and Trump, but rather suggests a flawed and biased investigation process.\n\nIn conclusion, the speculation about a conspiracy between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to throw the election lacks credible evidence.

Slightly more, 63 percent overall, viewed Trump unfavorably; 62 percent of independents. It’s those independents that Trump’s campaign hopes it can peel off — if it can keep up a steady drumbeat of negativity about Clinton. Three-quarters of voters in the poll said their pick for president is motivated by a desire to cast their ballot against either Clinton or Trump. Still, the criticism has triggered a backlash from some Republicans who say it’s beyond the pale. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who’s skipping the GOP convention, tweeted that Republicans “can make the case that she shouldn’t be elected without jumping the shark.” And Bill Pickle, a South Carolina delegate and talk radio host, said those doing the name-calling “sound and act like demons.” “I personally hate — I mean hate — all of the negativity,” Pickle said. “What happened to professionalism, manners and humanity in our politicians and citizens?” But most Republicans seem unperturbed. Wisconsin delegate Jim Geldreich said the stay-on-offense strategy was spot-on. Clinton, meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage.

He also “suggested that the Trump team had received some kind of suggestion from Russia that it could assist this process with the anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to Mrs. Clinton and [then-President Barack] Obama.”) The Australian diplomats later informed the FBI that the reason they even sent the email about Papadopoulos, whom they characterized as “insecure” and “trying to impress,” was because of the public release by Wikileaks of email communications that had been hacked from the Democratic National Committee’s servers.\nZero Investigation\nDurham noted on Page 58 of his report that the information from Papadopoulos was “clearly raw and unevaluated.” The information, even though unverified or uncorroborated, was the sole basis for the full-scale investigation of Trump.\nAs Durham noted, “the Crossfire Hurricane investigation [into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia] was immediately opened as a full investigation [rather than as an assessment or as a preliminary investigation], despite the fact that it was … predicated on unvetted hearsay information.” In fact, the “matter was opened as a full investigation without [the FBI] ever having spoken to the persons who provided the information.”\nDurham concluded that “the record reflects, as of early 2017, the FBI still did not possess any intelligence showing that anyone associated with the Trump campaign was in contact with Russian intelligence officers during the campaign.”\nBut worse still, “an experienced FBI analyst assessed that as a result of their access to information, [the sub-sources (secondhand sources) of certain information the FBI possessed] could have been compromised by the Russians at a point in time prior to the date of the first … dossier report” that was provided to the FBI.\nIn other words, Russian intelligence officers could have fed disinformation to the very people who were ultimately cited in the series of six reports prepared by Christopher Steele—the so-called Steele dossier—on behalf of the Clinton campaign and furnished to the FBI.\nDurham detailed how the FBI agents in charge of the investigation failed to take simple investigative steps, such as questioning the sources of some of this information and how befuddled allied intelligence services eventually declined to provide further assistance into this absurd investigation.\nBut some of these missteps may make more sense considering that “ … at the direction of [FBI] Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Deputy Assistant Director for Counterintelligence Peter Strozk opened Crossfire Hurricane immediately.”\n“Strzok was the agent who both wrote and approved the electronic communication opening the matter from the very start … .”\nDurham said, though, that his “investigation gathered evidence that showed that a number of those closest to the investigation believed that the standard [for opening a full investigation] had not been met.” Durham emphasizes that “(e)ven Strzok, who both drafted and approved the opening EC [electronic communication], said that ‘there’s nothing to this, but we have to run it to ground.’”\nStill, as Durham understatedly put it, “Strzok, at a minimum, had pronounced hostile feelings toward Trump.” Durham said that the “record reviewed by [his] office demonstrated a rather clear predisposition on the part of at least certain FBI personnel at the center of Crossfire Hurricane to open an investigation into Trump.”\nAs evidence, Durham cited the series of now-infamous text messages Strzok exchanged with McCabe’s special assistant, Lisa Page, denigrating Trump and saying things like “ … Hillary should win 100,000,000-0” and “Trump is a disaster. I have no idea how destabilizing his presidency would be.”\nHillary Clinton Gets a Pass\nNot only did Durham’s investigation reveal that Strzok and Page wanted Clinton to be president, but it also revealed that they thought she would be president and, as a \n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, there is significant evidence of investigations and allegations involving Hillary Clinton, particularly regarding her use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. However, there is no credible evidence presented here to suggest a conspiracy between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to throw the election. The investigations and controversies surrounding Clinton were primarily related to her personal conduct and the handling of sensitive information.\n\nThe investigations into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia were based on unverified information and appear to have been influenced by preconceived biases. This does not imply a conspiracy between Clinton and Trump, but rather suggests a flawed and biased investigation process.\n\nIn conclusion, the speculation about a conspiracy between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to throw the election lacks credible evidence. The focus of the investigations and controversies was on Clinton's private email server and the handling of classified information, not on a conspiracy involving both candidates. \n\n<answer>No</answer>",

    "question": "Do social media filters and editing promote unhealthy body image ideals?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, social media filters and editing tools can indeed contribute to promoting unhealthy body image ideals. Here's why:\n\n1. **Unrealistic Standards**: Filters and editing tools allow users to present themselves in highly idealized forms, which can create unrealistic beauty standards that users strive to meet. This can lead to dissatisfaction with one's own appearance.\n\n2. **Constant Exposure**: With billions of users on social media, people are constantly exposed to these idealized images, leading to frequent comparisons and feelings of inadequacy.\n\n3. **Self-Consciousness and Anxiety**: The ease of editing and sharing images can lead to increased self-consciousness and anxiety about one's appearance. Even when images are edited, people may feel that they do not measure up to what they see online.\n\n4. **Body Dysmorphic Disorder**: The constant comparison and the desire to achieve an impossible standard can contribute to conditions like body dysmorphic disorder, where individuals are overly concerned with perceived flaws in their appearance.\n\n5. **Negative Effects on Mental Health**: Studies show that spending more time on social media is correlated with higher levels of body dissatisfaction and depression, particularly among teenagers and young adults.\n\n6. **Cognitive Distortions**: Filters and editing can introduce distortions in how people perceive their own appearance, leading to cognitive biases and misperceptions about their body.\n\nIn conclusion, while social media filters and editing tools can offer some benefits, such as enhancing self-expression and creativity, they can also contribute to promoting unhealthy body image ideals and negative mental health outcomes.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Yes, social media filters and editing promote unhealthy body image ideals. </answer>",

Research clearly shows that media exposure contributes to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Social media is unfortunately shaping our concept of beauty. With constant exposure to images posted online, it is evident that there is a link to how individuals compare themselves and perceive their own body. There are an estimated 3.6 billion users worldwide on social media, therefore there must be negative and positive effects linked with social media users.) A negative body image can cause unrealistic expectations of how your body should look and can lead to unhealthy eating behaviors and disordered eating. Studies have found a correlation between the time spent on social media and a negative body image. The correlation is especially true when participants were scrolling through appearance-related content, like accounts of a fitness instructor or model on Instagram. Social media images are filled with people presenting the best version of themselves. Social media can then hurt your body image by constantly exposing yourself to the ideal body type, leading to constant comparison of yourself to unrealistic standards. Additionally, photoshop and filters are readily available to users playing into the unrealistic body image.\nHowever, social media can also have positive effects on body image and can promote body positivity. Viewing body-positive content on social media platforms can help individuals become more accepting and appreciative of their bodies. Additionally, social media can connect you with others to build a body-accepting community.\nIt is important to examine ways to use social media in a positive way to avoid a negative body image. It is important to take a break from social media if you feel worse after using it. Additionally, examine who you are following on social media and unfollow accounts if they do not make you feel good. Instead, pay attention to accounts, people, and images that lift you up. Follow accounts that promote body positivity that does not agree with the beauty standards set by society. (A great account to follow to begin your search for body positivity accounts is @realistic.body.therapist on Instagram.) Finding body-positive accounts and joining support groups can help shift your mindset about the ideal body image set by society. Furthermore, you can use your own social media to be an advocate for positive body talk. Shout out to media outlets, retailers, advertisers, and celebrity product endorsers who celebrate and promote natural looks, healthy body size, and diverse body shapes. You can take a stand and refuse to read, view, or listen to media or buy advertised products that do not promote a healthy and diverse body image.\nStudents should also consider participating in The Body Project or More Than Muscles programs offered through Student Counseling Services. These workshops help students develop and maintain a positive body image and are scientifically supported eating disorder prevention programs. Students will get a chance to dive deeper in conversations about the body image ideal set by society and promoted to us by the media.\nFor more information on how media effects body image visit https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/media-eating-disorders.\nDoc 2(Title: Filters and editing can lead to low self-esteem, depression and even body dysmorphic disorder) It’s normal to feel self-conscious about a picture of yourself from time to time, but when does self-judgment go too far? Selfies and filters have created a culture of insecurity and comparison that can be hard to drown out.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n“For the first time in human history, we’re carrying around devices that we use to take and share photographs,” says facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon Patrick Byrne, MD. “That has led to an obsession with appearance as it appears on a screen, which has fundamentally changed the challenges people face.”\nDr. Byrne explains how social media can affect your self-image and how today’s photo-editing culture has amplified a condition called body dysmorphic disorder.\nFilters and photo editing apps have made it easy to take the “perfect selfie.” But you may not realize exactly how much editing is going on behind the scenes of what we see posted on social media.\n“When you go to post your own picture or even appear on a Zoom call, you may be shocked and disappointed by the fact that you don’t look as glamorous or as perfect as what you see on social media,” Dr. Byrne notes. “For some people, this can be a source of anxiety and even shame.”\nThat anxiety and shame can quickly turn into self-esteem issues and even body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental health condition in which you’re consumed by thoughts about how you look and the defects you think you see.\n“Body dysmorphia is characterized by an overwhelming concern for one or more physical flaws,” Dr. Byrne explains.\nAdvertisement\nNo. Struggling with your self-image doesn’t automatically equal body dysmorphic disorder, which is a specifically diagnosed condition. People with BDD are so consumed by thoughts of their perceived flaws that they may have trouble maintaining a job, be too anxious to leave the house, and deal with depression and substance abuse.\nBut even if you don’t have body dysmorphia, you can still face very real self-esteem concerns that start with or are made worse by what you see on social media.\n“Everybody can feel these things sometimes,” Dr. Byrne clarifies. “Some of the traits that we see in body dysmorphic disorder we also see in people who don’t have this condition.”\nHave you ever looked in the mirror and liked what you saw … but then looked at a photo of yourself and hated it? Dr. Byrne says he often sees this happen in his office, when patients come to see him about their perceived flaws. They’ll look into a mirror and tell him, “Well, you can’t really see it here,” or “It’s not really showing up.”\n“Then, they instinctively pull out their phone and start showing us that their nose is too big or too crooked,” he continues. “That’s an incredible dynamic, to suggest that an image on your phone is more reflective of reality than the actual physical you who’s sitting in the room.”\nOne study of teen girls found that the more time they spend using social media, the more likely they were to experience “body dissatisfaction” and even depression. But teens aren’t the only ones who can have these internal responses to what they see online.\n“Everyone is prone to concerns about their appearance or having certain features they wish they could change,” Dr. Byrne concedes. “From typical concerns about wishing you could look a little different, all the way to the extreme end of body dysmorphic disorder, there are a lot of shades of gray in between.”\nLet’s dig a little deeper into some of the reasons why social media can be so deceptive — and can make you feel so bad.\nThese days, you can easily edit photos to your liking, from simple FaceTune “fixes” to TikTok filters that completely change your features, to nearly undetectable AI tools that can warp the size and shape o\nDoc 3(Title: into some of the reasons why social media can be so deceptive — and can make you feel so bad.) These days, you can easily edit photos to your liking, from simple FaceTune “fixes” to TikTok filters that completely change your features, to nearly undetectable AI tools that can warp the size and shape of your body.\n“We see that filters and editing tools are driving a lot of self-concern and anxiety,” Dr. Byrne says. “When you don’t like the way you look on screen, you can just magically fix it with the swipe of your finger on the screen.”\nOne British report studied 175 people ages 18 to 30. It found that 90% of respondents had used a filter or photo-editing tools to change their photos before posting them online.\nAdvertisement\nThe average American checks their phone 144 times a day, which can mean seeing a lot of your face (and others’) on social media. That constant exposure can take a toll.\n“Even before filters, we started to see that many people believe they look worse than they do,” Dr. Byrne says, “and they care more because they’re subjected to their own imagery all the time on social media platforms.”\nPlus, many of us now work remotely, staring at our own images all day long — not just on social media but also on video calls with colleagues.\n“People are on screens for virtual meetings for hours a day, often with unfavorable viewing angles and poor lighting,” he adds. “Sometimes, people come in saying they need a neck lift, and when we ask what prompted it, they say, ‘I’ve been staring at my neck on Zoom all day.’”\nWhat you see on your phone isn’t actually what others are seeing in real life. And even without filters, technology isn’t always telling you the truth.\nThe mirror-image function (where selfies are backward from the way you actually look) can confuse you into thinking that your face is exaggerated in size and symmetry. And one study found that selfies can distort facial proportions, making your nose look up to 30% larger than it is.\nAdvertisement\n“There are a number of ways that technology introduces cognitive distortions,” Dr. Byrne explains. “For example, we take high-depth professional studio images of our patients — but sometimes, people see that accurate version of themselves on our screen and they get confused and can’t even point out what they think the problem is. They’re basing their self-image on a medium that oftentimes distorts their facial features.”\nThere’s an old saying that “Comparison is the thief of joy,” and nowhere does that seem to be truer than on social media.\nEven in the early 2010s, long before the evolution of today’s filters and photo-editing technology, studies found that using social media (in those days, mostly Facebook) led users to compare themselves and their bodies to other people’s.\n“People are becoming progressively more image-obsessed, and I think that the progression of social media algorithms drives some of that,” Dr. Byrne reflects. “It really is an unhealthy dynamic, especially for young people who are still developing their self-esteem.”\nSo, what’s the solution? Well, as with so many other things in life, there’s no simple way forward. But here are some steps you can take to try to rein in your tendency to judge yourself and to stop the comparison game in its tracks.\nAdvertisement\nTake breaks from social media\nIf your social media use has your self-esteem in a free fall, it’s time to step back. Know when it’s time to unplug, and practice going analog by limiting your time online, scheduling your social media use and embracing mindfulness techniques.\nAcknowledge technology’s limitations\nRemember: You’re a whole, 3D human, and that’s how other people see you — in motion, on the go, vibrant and multidimensional. Photos and videos are just a snippet in time, and they’re not necessarily even accurate ones.\n“Try to take digital data sources with a grain of salt,” Dr. Byrne advises.\nEmbrace imperfection\nDid you know that only 2% of the global population has a symmetrical face?

On one hand, AI can improve efficiency, solve complex problems, and enhance human capabilities in various fields. On the other hand, there are concerns about potential dangers such as job displacement, privacy issues, and even existential risks if AI becomes uncontrollable or malfunctions.\n\nHowever, to fully understand the dangers, we need to consider current developments and expert opinions.\n</think>\n\n<search> development of artificial intelligence dangers </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: SQ10. What are the most pressing dangers of AI?) As AI systems prove to be increasingly beneficial in real-world applications, they have broadened their reach, causing risks of misuse, overuse, and explicit abuse to proliferate. As AI systems increase in capability and as they are integrated more fully into societal infrastructure, the implications of losing meaningful control over them become more concerning.1 New research efforts are aimed at re-conceptualizing the foundations of the field to make AI systems less reliant on explicit, and easily misspecified, objectives.2 A particularly visible danger is that AI can make it easier to build machines that can spy and even kill at scale. But there are many other important and subtler dangers at present.\nTechno-Solutionism\nOne of the most pressing dangers of AI is techno-solutionism, the view that AI can be seen as a panacea when it is merely a tool.3 As we see more AI advances, the temptation to apply AI decision-making to all societal problems increases. But technology often creates larger problems in the process of solving smaller ones. For example, systems that streamline and automate the application of social services can quickly become rigid and deny access to migrants or others who fall between the cracks.4\nWhen given the choice between algorithms and humans, some believe algorithms will always be the less-biased choice. Yet, in 2018, Amazon found it necessary to discard a proprietary recruiting tool because the historical data it was trained on resulted in a system that was systematically biased against women.5 Automated decision-making can often serve to replicate, exacerbate, and even magnify the same bias we wish it would remedy.\nIndeed, far from being a cure-all, technology can actually create feedback loops that worsen discrimination. Recommendation algorithms, like Google’s page rank, are trained to identify and prioritize the most “relevant” items based on how other users engage with them. As biased users feed the algorithm biased information, it responds with more bias, which informs users’ understandings and deepens their bias, and so on.6 Because all technology is the product of a biased system,7 techno-solutionism’s flaws run deep:8 a creation is limited by the limitations of its creator.\nDangers of Adopting a Statistical Perspective on Justice\nAutomated decision-making may produce skewed results that replicate and amplify existing biases. A potential danger, then, is when the public accepts AI-derived conclusions as certainties. This determinist approach to AI decision-making can have dire implications in both criminal and healthcare settings. AI-driven approaches like PredPol, software originally developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and UCLA that purports to help protect one in 33 US citizens,9 predict when, where, and how crime will occur. A 2016 case study of a US city noted that the approach disproportionately projected crimes in areas with higher populations of non-white and low-income residents.10 When datasets disproportionately represents the lower power members of society, flagrant discrimination is a likely result.\nSentencing decisions are increasingly decided by proprietary algorithms that attempt to assess whether a defendant will commit future crimes, leading to concerns that justice is being outsourced to software.11 As AI becomes increasingly capable of analyzing more and more factors that may correlate with a defendant's perceived risk, courts and society at large may mistake an algorithmic probability for fact. This dangerous reality means that an algorithmic estimate of an individual’s risk to society may be interpreted by others as a near certainty—a misleading outcome even the original tool designers warned against. Even though a statistically driven AI system could be built to report a degree of credence along with every prediction,12 there’s no guarantee that the people using these predictions will make intelligent use of them.

The likely concentration of data and growing use of alternative data in AI/ML could result in, respectively, the risk of uniformity (herding) and out-of-sample risk that eventually could lead to systemic risk.\n    \n*   ■ The widespread use of AI/ML could potentially increase procyclicality of financial conditions. For instance, credit underwriting and risk management processes are inherently procyclical, reacting to financial conditions in ways that reinforce and amplify those changes (that is, falling default rates lead to more lending, which can further lower default rates). AI/ML may automate and accelerate the procyclicality and potentially obscure it (due to explainability issues).\n    \n*   ■ Moreover, in the case of a tail risk event, an inaccurate risk assessment and reaction by ML algorithms could quickly amplify and spread the shock throughout the financial system and complicate or even undermine the effectiveness of the policy response.\n    \n*   ■ Challenges in interpretation, sustainability of analytical power, and prediction of models raise the concern that economic policies or market strategies based on these models will be challenging to interpret or predict by the relevant counterparties, creating additional asymmetric information in the market, with an uncertain impact on financial stability.\n    \n*   ■ Finally, regulatory gaps could adversely impact financial stability if technological advances outpace existing regulations. Such advances are often led by providers who may fall outside existing regulatory perimeters.[21](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn21)\n    \n\nThe rapid evolution of AI/ML has led to a range of regulatory responses. While some jurisdictions have taken a more holistic approach to addressing the issues involved (for example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore[22](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn22) and De Nederlandsche Bank[23](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn23)), others have concluded that existing regulations and expectations on good governance are sufficient to address the emerging issues. Whether it is by way of new regulations or existing ones, regulators have generally focused on AI/ML governance frameworks, risk management, internal controls, and better controls over the model and data.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires broad regulatory and collaborative efforts. An adequate policy response requires developing clear minimum standards and guidelines for the sector, coupled with stronger focus on securing the necessary technical skills. Given the inherent interconnectivity of issues related to the deployment of AI/ML systems in the financial sector, collaboration among financial institutions, central banks, financial supervisors, and other stakeholders is important to avoid duplication of work and to help counter potential risks. Many leading jurisdictions in the AI/ML sector have relied on well-articulated national AI strategies for promoting AI/ML development while ensuring that regulatory gaps do not materialize. Annex 3 provides an overview of country approaches to developing AI national strategies.\n\n4\\.

This trend is driven by rapid increases in computational powers, data storage capacity, and big data, as well as by signifi\nDoc 3(Title: imination and Risk in the Medical Setting) While personalized medicine is a good potential application of AI, there are dangers. Current business models for AI-based health applications tend to focus on building a single system—for example, a deterioration predictor—that can be sold to many buyers. However, these systems often do not generalize beyond their training data. Even differences in how clinical tests are ordered can throw off predictors, and, over time, a system’s accuracy will often degrade as practices change. Clinicians and administrators are not well-equipped to monitor and manage these issues, and insufficient thought given to the human factors of AI integration has led to oscillation between mistrust of the system (ignoring it) and over-reliance on the system (trusting it even when it is wrong), a central concern of the 2016 AI100 report.\nThese concerns are troubling in general in the high-risk setting that is healthcare, and even more so because marginalized populations—those that already face discrimination from the health system from both structural factors (like lack of access) and scientific factors (like guidelines that were developed from trials on other populations)—may lose even more. Today and in the near future, AI systems built on machine learning are used to determine post-operative personalized pain management plans for some patients and in others to predict the likelihood that an individual will develop breast cancer. AI algorithms are playing a role in decisions concerning distributing organs, vaccines, and other elements of healthcare. Biases in these approaches can have literal life-and-death stakes.\nIn 2019, the story broke that Optum, a health-services algorithm used to determine which patients may benefit from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental racial biases. The system designers ensured that race was precluded from consideration, but they also asked the algorithm to consider the future cost of a patient to the healthcare system.17 While intended to capture a sense of medical severity, this feature in fact served as a proxy for race: controlling for medical needs, care for Black patients averages $1,800 less per year.\nNew technologies are being developed every day to treat serious medical issues. A new algorithm trained to identify melanomas was shown to be more accurate than doctors in a recent study, but the potential for the algorithm to be biased against Black patients is significant as the algorithm was trained using majority light-skinned groups.18 The stakes are especially high for melanoma diagnoses, where the five-year survival rate is 17 percentage points less for Black Americans than white. While technology has the potential to generate quicker diagnoses and thus close this survival gap, a machine-learning algorithm is only as good as its data set. An improperly trained algorithm could do more harm than good for patients at risk, missing cancers altogether or generating false positives. As new algorithms saturate the market with promises of medical miracles, losing sight of the biases ingrained in their outcomes could contribute to a loss of human biodiversity, as individuals who are left out of initial data sets are denied adequate care. While the exact long-term effects of algorithms in healthcare are unknown, their potential for bias replication means any advancement they produce for the population in aggregate—from diagnosis to resource distribution—may come at the expense of the most vulnerable.\n[1] Brian Christian, The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values, W.

Machine learning algorithms are used for forecasting and benefit from using large data sets.

Artificial intelligence systems can communicate by understanding and generating human language.

Facial and signature recognition is being used by some financial institutions and financial technology companies to assist with carrying out certain anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements (for example, the identification and verification of customers for customer due diligence process), and for strengthening systems security.\n    \n*   _Anomaly detection_. Classification algorithms can be applied to detect rare items, outliers, or anomalous data. In the financial sector, insider trading, credit card and insurance fraud detection, and AML/CFT are some of the applications that leverage this capability ([Chandola, Banerjee, and Kumar 2009](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001ref06)).\n    \n\n2\\. Artificial Intelligence in the Financial Sector\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe capability of acquiring large sets of data from the environment and processing it with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is changing the financial sector landscape. AI/ML facilitates enhanced capacity to predict economic, financial, and risk events; reshape financial markets; improve risk management and compliance; strengthen prudential oversight; and equip central banks with new tools to pursue their monetary and macroprudential mandates.\n\n### A. Forecasting\n\nAI/ML systems are used in the financial sector to forecast macro-economic and financial variables, meet customer demands, provide payment capacity, and monitor business conditions. AI/ML models offer flexibility compared to traditional statistical and econometric models, can help explore otherwise hard-to-detect relationships between variables, and amplify the toolkits used by institutions. Evidence suggests that ML methods often outperform linear regression-based methods in forecast accuracy and robustness ([Bolhuis and Rayner 2020](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001ref05)).\n\nWhile the use of AI/ML in forecasting offers benefits, it also poses challenges. Use of nontraditional data (for example, social media data, browsing history, and location data) in AI/ML could be beneficial in finding new relationships between variables. Similarly, by using AI natural language processing (NLP), unstructured data (for example, the information in email texts) can be brought into the forecasting process. However, the use of nontraditional data in financial forecasting raises several concerns, includin\nDoc 5(Title: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Statement for the Record Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community) \ninue to develop\n\nand deploy AI capabilities, AI-enhanced systems are likely to be trusted with increasing levels of\n\nautonomy and decisionmaking, presenting the world with a host of economic, military, ethical, and\n\n16\n\nprivacy challenges.

And I also want to\n\nrecognize the University of Virginia's Institute of Democracy for more generally\n\nsupporting our efforts to understand what's been happening since the aftermath of\n\nthe presidential election in November.\n\nOur topic today is whether the president can pardon himself. As President Trump\n\nprepares to leave office, can he give himself a presidential pardon? Is that\n\nconstitutional? We want to ask questions about the arguments for and against self-\n\npardoning. What does the original meaning of the Constitution say about this\n\nissue? Is there precedent for it?\n\nThis expert panel will focus on the constitutional basis of the pardon power, its\n\nhistory and limits, the relationship between pardoning and impeachment-- which,\n\nof course, has become that much more important this week, and also the legal and\n\npolitical implications of an attempt by the president to self-pardon. We have with us\n\ntoday three experts in this area. Let me introduce them in the order in which I'll ask\n\nthem to present first.\n\nIs Brian Kalt, who is a professor of law and the Harold Norris faculty scholar at\n\nMichigan State University. His research focuses on structural constitutional law in\n\njuries. His recent publications include the books _Constitutional Cliffhangers, A Legal_\n\n_Guide for Presidents and Their Enemies,_ and, incredibly timely, the book _Unable,_\n\n_The Law, Politics and Limits of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment._\n\nNext in order of presentation is Professor Bernadette Meyler, who is the Carl and\n\nSheila Spaeth Professor of Law, and professor by courtesy in English, and the\n\nAssociate Dean for Research and Intellectual Life at Stanford University. She's a\n\nscholar of British and American constitutional law, and of law in the humanities,\n\nand of 2020, Guggenheim fellow in constitutional studies.\n\nAnd we have with us as well my colleague John Harrison, who is the James Madison\n\ndistinguished Professor of Law and the Thomas F. Bergen teaching professor of law\n\nat the University of Virginia School of Law. He joined our faculty after a\n\ndistinguished career with the US Department of Justice, including the Office of\n\nLegal Counsel. He's also served as counselor on international law in the Office of\n\nthe Legal Advisor at the US Department of State.\n\nI'm going to give our panelists about 10 minutes to share some thoughts about the\n\nquestions that I've prompted, and perhaps other ideas and thoughts about this\n\ntopic. And then we'll have about 30 minutes for question and answers. If you have a\n\nquestion, please enter it in the Q&A function, which should be at the bottom of your\n\nscreen, and I'll convey those questions to our panelists.\n\nI'm going to start with Brian Kalt, and maybe you can begin by telling us what the\n\npardon power is and what is its basis in the Constitution?\n\n**BRIAN KALT:**\n\nArticle 2 gives the president the power to grant pardons and reprieves for offenses\n\nagainst the United States, except in cases of impeachment. And there aren't a lot\n\nof limits expressed in the text, so it is one of the president's broadest, least limited\n\npowers. It's not subject to congressional authorization, like most of his take care\n\npowers. It's not subject to judicial review. The merits of a pardon, anyway, are not\n\nreviewable in court under \nDoc 3(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \n I'll make-- and realizing that the\n\nconsequences of the president pardoning himself for bad reasons would be\n\nnegative, but they generally wouldn't be disastrous or catastrophic. Important thing\n\nto remember-- the president can pardon only for offenses against the United\n\nStates. A lot of the really bad scenarios involving presidential pardons of the\n\npresident involve conduct that may well violate the law of the state and be\n\nseparately punishable.\n\nSo does the Constitution contemplate bad self-pardons in order to allow a good\n\nthing, good self-pardons? Yes, I think it does. That's the way power works, and\n\nthere's no way around that.\n\n**MICAH**\n\n**SCHWARTZMAN:**\n\nThanks, John.\n\nWe have a lot to talk about. And there are lots and lots of questions. Let me lead off\n\nwith this one, which picks up on what John has been talking about in terms of the\n\nabuse of the pardon power. And this question asks, \"Can a president commit\n\ntreason while in office and pardon him or herself for that crime?\"\n\nI suspect, Brian, that you have thoughts about this. And maybe some responses to\n\nJohn's comments. So let me start with you, and we'll go from there.\n\n**BRIAN KALT:**\n\nSure. Really quickly, I want to respond to one thing that John said. Conflict of\n\ninterest is different from being a judge in your own case. I think John elided the\n\ndistinction between legislative and adjudicative. And if you're doing something in\n\ngeneral, like legislation, then, yeah, that could affect you. But something\n\nadjudicative that's about your own case, not being a judge in your own case means\n\nit's just about you. It's not about everyone and you're part of everyone. It's just\n\nabout you. So I think that's an important distinction, especially because, generally\n\nspeaking, due process principles only really apply to those adjudicative functions\n\nrather than the legislative ones.\n\nAs far as treason is concerned, this question tees up a very important part of the\n\nconstitutional history. So treason is one of the things the president can pardon for.\n\nIt was the basis of the first pardons that George Washington gave to the Whiskey\n\nRebellion defendants.\n\nAnd this troubled people. So when the convention was debating whether the\n\npresident should have a restriction on his power, one of the things they said was he\n\nshouldn't be able to pardon for treason. Or if he pardons for treason, there should\n\nbe more process.\n\nAnd so, Edmund Randolph, in proposing a restriction on pardoning for treason, said\n\nthe president may himself be guilty. The traitors may be his own instrument. And\n\nthe response that drew was, if the president be himself a party to the guilt, he can\n\nbe impeached and prosecuted. That was James Wilson's response. And it carries\n\ntoday. They didn't restrict the pardon power for treason.\n\nEven contemplating that a president might abuse the power-- as John said, power\n\ncan be abused. Even contemplating the president could abuse the power, they\n\nwanted to keep the power broad, so that people like George Washington could use\n\nit for things like the Whiskey Rebellion.\n\nBut no, if the safeguard here is that the president can be impeached and\n\nprosecuted, you'd be relying on a president who's a traitor, who's leading a\n\ntreasonous insurrection and pardoning all of his minions, to not pardon himself.\n\nAnd at best, I think that suggests that they didn't even think that a self-pardon\n\nmight be a thing.\n\nBut reading that back-and-forth in Madison's notes, it suggests that they thought a\n\nself-pardon just wouldn't be a thing. Otherwise, the possibility of hemming in a\n\npresident like that, by prosecuting him, wouldn't have given anyone comfort and\n\nthey would have voted to restrict the pardon power. So, yeah. If the president can\n\npardon himself-- maybe he can, maybe he can't-- but if he can, he can pardon\n\nhimself for treason.\n\n**MICAH**\n\n**SCHWARTZMAN:**\n\nI have a question from the audience. This one is directed to you, Bernie, and it go\nDoc 4(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \nren't a lot\n\nof limits expressed in the text, so it is one of the president's broadest, least limited\n\npowers. It's not subject to congressional authorization, like most of his take care\n\npowers. It's not subject to judicial review. The merits of a pardon, anyway, are not\n\nreviewable in court under the political question doctrine.\n\nBut the self-pardon presents an interesting question as to whether and what sorts\n\nof other limits might exist. And starting with the text-- I just said, there aren't a lot\n\nof limits there, but there are limits implicit in the notion of what a pardon actually\n\nis. So for instance, as an analogy, a pardon can only be granted for something that\n\nthe person receiving the pardon has already done. You can't pardon a future act.\n\nThe Constitution doesn't say that. It's just implicit in the definition of what a pardon\n\nis.\n\nSo one textual argument against self-pardons is that a pardon is inherently\n\nsomething that you give to somebody else. The Latin root of \"pardon\" comes from\n\nthe same root as words like \"condone\" or \"donate.\"\n\nYou can't make a donation to yourself. It just doesn't make sense. I mean, you can\n\npass money from one hand to another. But if you call it a donation, you're wrong. It\n\njust doesn't fit the category. And so the argument goes that is not a pardon.\n\nSimilarly, the Constitution talks about granting pardons, and some have argued\n\nthat granting something inherently means something you give to someone else.\n\nThere's also, not in the text, but in the general jurisprudence, the principle that you\n\ncannot be the judge in your own case. Of course, a pardon isn't something that a\n\njudge gives. The president isn't being a judge, he's being a president.\n\nBut if you look at the pardon as part of the criminal justice process, it would be odd\n\nif, unlike everyone else at every other stage, the president was able to deal himself\n\nsome sort of self-judgment. If you're a criminal defendant, we don't let you be on\n\nthe jury, we don't let you be the prosecutor, we don't let you be the judge, and\n\narguably, we don't let you be the president who decides if you should get a pardon\n\nor not. In all of those other cases, we have someone else fill that role.\n\nAnd here, the argument would be someone else should be president. Someone\n\nelse, your successor, should decide whether you merit a pardon or not.\n\nFinally, there's a structural argument against self-pardons. The presidency is\n\nsupposed to be limited. And the pardon power derives, in a lot of ways, from the\n\nBritish monarch's pardon power. It's more limited in some ways.\n\nBut the issue of pardon wouldn't come up in the British context because it's not\n\nthat the King couldn't have pardoned himself in 1787, it's that such a thing\n\nwouldn't make sense. The King could do no wrong. He couldn't be prosecuted. He\n\ncould be deposed and executed, but such extralegal options wouldn't respond to\n\nthe pardon power either.\n\nSo when we think about converting, translating the King's pardon power to the\n\npresident's pardon power, we're left with a translation problem. Presidents aren't\n\nsupposed to be kings. At the same time, they can pardon people, which makes\n\nthem look like kings. But a self-pardon is something that would allow the president\n\nto burst free from the limits that the Constitution imposes. You're supposed to be\n\npresident until you're not. If you're a king, you're a king for the rest of your life. But\n\nif you're a president, you're supposed to, at some point, not be president anymore.\n\nAllowing a president to pardon himself would be allowing him to project his power\n\nas president past the end of his term in a way that doesn't sit well with the\n\nstructure.\n\nI did want to say briefly something about scholarship in general, because I know\n\nthere are some students in the audience. And that is this question came up for me\n\nwhen I was a second-year law student in a criminal procedure class. We were\n\ntalking about presidenti\nDoc 5(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \neir spouses. Lots of people care more about their children than they care about\n\nthemselves. If anything is a conflict of interest, it's the possibility of giving a pardon\n\nto your child.\n\nBut the Constitution permits that. There isn't a general principle either broadly or\n\nas to the pardon power that people can't act when their own interests are being\n\naffected.\n\nThe main argument against the president pardoning himself is that would be a\n\nterrible thing. And the hypothetical that people have in mind when they think about\n\nthat is the president has committed a crime and has decided, \"I don't want to have\n\nto go to jail for this.\" And it's certainly true that the pardon power, like any power,\n\ncan be misused.\n\nBut one of the things that people do in law school, and it's a good thing, is learn to\n\nthink about different hypothetical possibilities that may be cut against their initial\n\npresuppositions. So I want to suggest a situation in which it might be quite\n\nreasonable for the president to give a pardon to the president. Suppose that the\n\nPresident of the United States decides to say to a couple of close aides-- and here I\n\nwill demonstrate that I remember Watergate-- \"You should deep six those\n\ndocuments.\"\n\nAnd maybe there's a really good reason to deep six the documents. Maybe they\n\nwould be very embarrassing to the head of another government from which the\n\nUnited States wants something. Maybe deep sixing the documents is a crime in my\n\nhypothetical, but maybe it's not. The law is unclear about this, as it may well be.\n\nAnd maybe the law is unconstitutional because it unduly intrudes into the\n\npresident's control of the executive branch.\n\nSo suppose an act that's a good idea as a policy matter, arguably illegal but\n\narguably legal, in the law, arguably unconstitutional. And the president realizes\n\nthat the incoming president is a very vindictive political opponent of his who would\n\nlove nothing better than to bring a criminal prosecution so as to discredit his\n\npredecessor. That President might think, \"If it were anybody but me, I'd issue a\n\npardon. I'd issue a pardon to the people I told to deep six the document. And\n\nprosecuting me, in addition to being bad for me, would be bad for the country. So\n\nI'm going to pardon everybody, including myself.\"\n\nThat, I think, would be a legitimate use of the pardon power from the standpoint of\n\nits purposes, which include preventing miscarriages of justice and serving the\n\npublic interest. So just as there are misuses of the power for the president to\n\npardon himself, there are good uses of the power. And there's a general principle\n\nabout power, which is it can be misused.\n\nCongress can do things that are entirely lawful and are extremely bad policy or\n\nextremely bad as a matter of moral principle. Congress can launch a war of\n\naggression. Congress can do that-- Congress has done that. That's what the\n\nMexican-American War was. It was entirely constitutional.\n\nSo yes, power can be misused. But it can also be used for good purposes. And the\n\npeople in the federal convention in 1787 realized that the person who was in the\n\nchair was not going to be there forever. They understood that some of his\n\nsuccessors could be people who were not such splendid individuals.\n\nBut they also hoped, I think reasonably, that most of Washington's successors\n\nwould be decent people who had the public interest at heart. And so they gave\n\nthose people power, including the power to pardon themselves, that can be abused\n\nlike any power can be abused, but hoping that it wouldn't normally be abused. Like\n\nmost powers would not be abused.\n\nAnd realizing-- and this is the last point I'll make-- and realizing that the\n\nconsequences of the president pardoning himself for bad reasons would be\n\nnegative, but they generally wouldn't be disastrous or catastrophic. Important thing\n\nto remember-- the president can pardon only for offenses against the United\n\nStates. A lot of the reall\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the discussion, it appears that the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit a president from pardoning themselves. However, there are several legal and ethical arguments against it:\n\n1. **Conflict of Interest**: A president pardoning themselves would be acting as both the prosecutor and the judge, which goes against the principle that no one should be the judge in their own case.\n2. **Impeachment**: While a president could be impeached for misuse of the pardon power, this relies on the assumption that the president is not already guilty of the crime they are trying to pardon.\n3. **Historical Precedent**: The framers of the Constitution did not explicitly address self-pardons, and it seems they did not consider it a relevant scenario.\n4. **Policy and Public Interest**: A self-pardon could undermine public trust and the integrity of the justice system.\n\nDespite these arguments, the Constitution does not explicitly prevent a president from pardoning themselves, making the legality somewhat ambiguous. However, the ethical and practical considerations strongly suggest that a president should not pardon themselves.\n</think>\n\n<answer> No, the President cannot legally pardon themselves, but the constitution does not explicitly prohibit it.

They are not laws but have the force of law when based on authority granted by a statute or the Constitution. The debate often centers around whether they are a necessary part of governance or an overreach of executive power.\n\nTo better understand this, I should check the general perception and legal framework regarding executive orders.</think>\n\n<search> importance and legality of executive orders </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: One of the first “orders” of business for President Donald Trump was signing an executive order to weaken Obamacare, while Republicans figure out how to replace it. So what powers do executive orders have?) An executive order is a directive from the President that has much of the same power as a federal law. Several landmark moments in American history came about directly from the use of executive orders issued from the White House’s desk, including one Supreme Court decision that limited a presidential executive order issued by Harry Truman.\nIn President Trump’s case, his executive order on Obamacare allows federal agencies to “take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the [Affordable Care] act, and prepare to afford the states more flexibility and control to create a more free and open health care market.”\nThe constitutional basis for the executive order is the President’s broad power to issue executive directives. According to the Congressional Research Service, there is no direct “definition of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations in the U.S. Constitution, there is, likewise, no specific provision authorizing their issuance.”\nBut Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests executive powers in the President, makes him the commander in chief, and requires that the President “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Laws can also give additional powers to the President.\nWhile an executive order can have the same effect as a federal law under certain circumstances, Congress can pass a new law to override an executive order, subject to a presidential veto.\nEvery President since George Washington has used the executive order power in various ways. Washington’s first orders were for executive departments to prepare reports for his inspection, and a proclamation about the Thanksgiving holiday. After Washington, other Presidents made significant decisions via executive orders and presidential proclamations.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War using executive orders in 1861. Lincoln cited his powers under the Constitution’s Suspension Clause, which states, “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion and invasion the public safety may require it.”\nSupreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, in his role as a federal circuit judge, ruled that Lincoln’s executive order was unconstitutional in a decision called Ex Parte Merryman. Lincoln and the Union army ignored Taney, and Congress didn’t contest Lincoln’s habeas corpus decisions.\nTwo other executive orders comprised Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln was fearful that the Emancipation Proclamation would be overturned by Congress or the courts after the war’s end, since he justified the proclamation under his wartime powers. The ratification of the 13th Amendment ended that potential controversy.\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt established internment camps during World War II using Executive Order 9066. Roosevelt also used an executive order to create the Works Progress Administration.\nAnd President Harry Truman mandated equal treatment of all members of the armed forces through executive orders. However, Truman also saw one of his key executive orders invalidated by the Supreme Court in 1952, in a watershed moment for the Court that saw it define presidential powers in relation to Congress.\nThe Court ruled in Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer that an executive order putting steel mills during the Korean War under federal control during a strike was invalid. “The President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker,” Justice Hugo Black said in his majority opinion.\nIt was Justice Robert Jackson’s concurring opinion that stated a three-part test of presidential powers that has since been used in arguments involving the executive’s\nDoc 2(Title: hat the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker,” Justice Hugo Black said in his majority opinion.) It was Justice Robert Jackson’s concurring opinion that stated a three-part test of presidential powers that has since been used in arguments involving the executive’s overreach of powers.\nJackson said the President’s powers were at their height when he had the direct or implied authorization from Congress to act; at their middle ground – the Zone of Twilight, as he put it, when it was unsure which branch could act; and at their “lowest ebb” when a President acted against the expressed wishes of Congress.\nThe use of executive orders also played a key role in the Civil Rights movement. In 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower used an executive order to put the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and to enforce desegregation in Little Rock. Affirmative action and equal employment opportunity actions were also taken by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson using executive orders.\nPresident Roosevelt issued the most executive orders, according to records at the National Archives. He issued 3,728 orders between 1933 and 1945, as the country dealt with the Great Depression and World War II.\nPresident Truman issued a robust 896 executive orders over almost eight years in office. President Barack Obama issued 277 orders during his presidency. His predecessor, President George W. Bush, issued 291 orders over eight years, while President Bill Clinton had 364 executive orders during his two terms in office.\nThe most-active President in the post-World War II era, in terms of executive orders, was Jimmy Carter, who averaged 80 orders per year during his four-year term.\nDoc 3(Title: Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity) \nhe establishment of the related Office within the Executive Office of the President, pursuant to section 1752 of Public Law 116-283, portions of this order may be modified to enable the NCD to fully execute its duties and responsibilities.  \n    (b)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  \n        (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or  \n        (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.  \n    (c)  This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  \n    (d)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  \n    (e)  Nothing in this order confers authority to interfere with or to direct a criminal or national security investigation, arrest, search, seizure, or disruption operation or to alter a legal restriction that requires an agency to protect information learned in the course of a criminal or national security investigation.\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,  \n    May 12, 2021.\nDoc 4(Title: Weekly Columns) I’ve heard from thousands of Arkansans who are concerned about President Obama’s executive action to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. I share those concerns because the President’s order is unconstitutional. While Congress works to defund the President’s overreach, a recent court decision by a U.S. District Court Judge has fortunately put the brakes on that plan.\nIn his 123-page decision blocking the President’s immigration policy Judge Andre Hanen wrote, “These changes go beyond mere enforcement or even non-enforcement of this nation’s immigration scheme.”\nThis ruling verifies that when the President moved from enforcement to simply ignoring the law, he clearly overstepped his authority.\nThis is a recurrent pattern by the President. He has arbitrarily changed who has to follow the law, what laws to follow and when. He directed his administration to make changes to our nation’s immigration policy, circumventing Congress and the system of checks and balances clearly defined in the Constitution. The President acknowledged nearly two dozen times that he doesn’t have the authority to grant this executive action before he announced his unilateral plans.\nI was pleased that Arkansas joined 25 other states to challenge this executive overreach. The judicial process is one tool in the fight against this overreach. I also support using the power of the purse to defund these actions.\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) funding expires at the end of February. The House passed a bill that defunds the President’s immigration executive action while funding the rest of the DHS’s responsibilities, but Senate Democrats blocked the bill from even being debated in the senate. Considering the recent court ruling, passing this bill is not an unreasonable request.\nWe face serious threats to our national security. Filibustering this bill leaves our country vulnerable to terrorists. It’s time to stop putting the vital DHS security programs at risk. Senate Democrats should stop protecting this unconstitutional overreach and debate the bill to ensure the safety and security of our nation.\nOur immigration system needs to be fixed but improvements must be made by Congress. We need to secure our borders, enforce the immigration laws we have and hold those people who break the law accountable.\nAmerica continues to be a beacon of hope and attracts people from around the world who are encouraged to live the American Dream. However, we are a nation of laws and everyone must follow those laws or face the consequences. Judge Hanen’s ruling is an important first step in reversing the President’s unconstitutional overreach because even he is not above the law.\nDoc 5(Title: er executive order signed by the president in January.) April 23: President Trump issued an executive order stating that it is the policy of the administration to eliminate the use of disparate impact liability in all contexts to the maximum degree possible. The order seeks to rewrite several civil rights laws and weaponize them to require discrimination, and it directs regulation, non-enforcement, and a review of existing enforcement actions.\nApril 23: President Trump issued six education-related executive orders regarding school discipline policies, artificial intelligence, preparing Americans for high-paying skilled trade jobs, HBCUs, reforming accreditation, and foreign influence at American universities. The school discipline order, for example, gives the secretary of education, in consultation with the attorney general, 30 days to issue new school discipline guidance that will undo the important guidance issued during the Obama and Biden administrations.\nApril 24: The Department of Justice asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the president’s discriminatory policy banning all transgender people from joining or continuing to serve in the military to take effect.\nApril 28: President Trump issued an executive order that directs federal resources to promote aggressive policing tactics and further militarize local law enforcement agencies, provides greater protections for law enforcement officers accused of misconduct, and wields threats of possible federal prosecutions for certain activities, including certain “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives.\nApril 28: President Trump issued an executive order that directs the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions that “obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” and to pursue legal remedies and enforcement measures to bring non-compliant jurisdictions into compliance. The order calls for the identification of federal funds that can be suspended or terminated to sanctuary jurisdictions, and it instructs the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to develop mechanisms for eligibility verification in sanctuary jurisdictions to prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal public benefits.\nApril 28: According to reports, all senior civil servants working as managers in the voting section of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division were removed, and attorneys were directed by political appointees to dismiss all active cases.\nApril 28: The Department of the Treasury published in the Federal Register a request for public comment seeking to remove sexual orientation and gender identity from the internal EEO form that employees use to allege discrimination.\nApril 29: The Department of Justice announced that it is withdrawing from a decades-old desegregation consent decree in Louisiana, with Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon claiming that dismissing a remedy against intentional segregation was “righting a historical wrong, freeing the local school district of federal oversight.”\nMay 2: President Trump announced the first judicial nominee of his second term — Whitney Hermandorfer for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Tennessee). The nomination replaces a nominee during the previous administration who had critical civil rights and labor law experience.

    "agent_answer": "The information provided discusses the challenges of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, particularly oil, and the impact of the Paris Climate Agreement on oil production. It mentions that the demand for oil is expected to peak before 2030 according to BP scenarios, but other estimates suggest it might not happen until after 2030. The information also touches on the role of oil in various sectors beyond transportation, such as petrochemicals and fertilizers, indicating that reducing oil consumption is complex and multifaceted.\n\nHowever, the main point regarding the Paris Climate Agreement is that it does not directly ban or limit oil production, but it sets a framework for reducing emissions from production processes. Companies are exploring ways to reduce emissions through carbon capture and sequestration technologies. Some countries are even marketing low-emission oil, although the effectiveness of this strategy remains debatable.\n\nGiven this context, the Paris Climate Agreement is not a dead letter, but it faces significant challenges in achieving its goals due to the ongoing demand for oil and the complexity of transitioning away from fossil fuels. The best scenario for reducing dependence on fossil fuels would involve a combination of technological advancements, policy changes, and international cooperation to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources.\n</think>\n\nBased on the information provided, the Paris Climate Agreement is not a dead letter but faces challenges in achieving its goals.

In traditionally public spaces set aside for the exchange of ideas, like public parks, the government may not completely ban artistic expression unless it has a compelling interest that cannot be accomplished through less restrictive means. The government may, however, enforce reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, such as requiring performances to take place within certain hours or limiting the size of the audience for purposes of public safety. In the event the government does enforce time, place, and manner restrictions, these elements must be viewpoint neutral and may not censor one opinion and favor another.\nA designated public forum is one that the government has made available for public expression, but has not been traditionally set aside for the free exchange of ideas.\nFor example, a city hall allowing an art exhibit has been held to be a designated public forum. In this context, the government may censor artistic expression based on content only to the extent that such restriction preserves the purpose of the place. Thus, a city hall art exhibition could allow for quiet performances, yet restrict raucous musical groups from performing.\nThe government may completely censor expression in a nonpublic forum, such as a military facility or a mayor’s private office. Even in nonpublic spaces, the restrictions must be reasonable and not an effort to suppress a specific viewpoint while allowing for the expression of others.\nGovernment may use funding to indirectly censor art\nTo the extent that the government funds the arts, it may indirectly censor artists by refusing to finance projects.\nThe federal government did not become significantly involved with sponsoring the arts until it created the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in 1965. In the 1980s, the NEA sparked a public and political uproar when it helped fund exhibits with controversial themes.\nCritics accused the NEA of financing obscenity, and Congress passed an arts funding law in 1990 requiring that public values be considered in awarding grants. The Supreme Court upheld that law in 1998, ruling in National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley (1998) that the government need not subsidize art it considers indecent.\nAlthough Finley does not stand for the proposition that disagreeable art is subject to censorship, it does mean that the government need not sponsor art it finds offensive.\nSimilar to the Finley case, government officials sometimes invoke the government speech doctrine in art display cases.\nFor example, a controversy ensued over a high school student’s painting that was removing from the Capitol Building, because it had anti-police themes and offended some members of Congress.\nThe student artist and the representative who supported the painting challenged the removal in federal court. However, a federal district court judge in Pulphus v. Ayers (D.D.C. 2017) ruled that the art display was a form of government speech largely because the government retained the ability to exercise editorial control over which paintings were displayed.\nThis article was originally published in 2009 and updated in 2017.

Despite this early recognition, artistic expression has historically been subject to some measure of direct or indirect censorship in the United States.\nThe First Amendment provides significant protection to artistic expression and, as a result, severely limits the government’s right to censor controversial works in most contexts. Nonetheless, restrictions on the publication of art continues in several contexts.\nThe scope of protection afforded to artistic expression largely depends on the nature of the speech. Artistic expression through the spoken or written word, particularly in the form of political protest or satirical speeches or writings, such as plays or stories, is akin to “pure speech”and is entitled to comprehensive protection.\nBy contrast, art created for commercial purposes or not designed to convey an expressive message (such as nude dancing) is entitled to less protection.\nObscene artistic expression without “serious artistic value” may be censored\nSome artistic expression is subject to censorship based on its content.\nFor example, “obscene” materials may be censored. Legitimate artistic expressions are never, however, considered obscene because in Miller v. California (1973) the Supreme Court excluded materials with “serious artistic value” from the definition of obscenity.\n“Indecent” works, which are less than obscene but make use of patently offensive terms to describe sexuality or bodily functions, may be restricted. In Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation (1978), the Court held that indecent material, particularly in the context of television or radio broadcasts, which cannot be banned entirely under the First Amendment, may be restricted to avoid broadcast during times when children might typically view or hear it.\nExpression that offends others’ rights may be censored\nArtistic expressions that are neither obscene nor indecent may also be censored because they offend the rights of others.\nFor example, defamatory works — those that maliciously harm a person’s character through falsehoods — fall outside the scope of the First Amendment and may be censored.\nBy contrast, the First Amendment does protect obvious satire of a public figure, so such expressions are not subject to censorship. In addition, artistic expressions that break various statutory laws, such as artistic renderings of currency that violate anti-counterfeiting law or works that offend copyright laws, may also be subject to censorship.\nPrior restraint attempts have been unsuccessful\nThe maxim against prior restraint prohibits federal, state, and local governments from requiring a person to seek permission before publishing or speaking.\nThe rationale for placing a heavy burden on the government in this regard is that a ruling denying the right to exhibit or publish a work of art prior to its publication amounts to censorship. In light of this reasoning, attempts by the government to limit expression through prior restraint have largely been unsuccessful.\nPrior restraints have, however, been upheld in some limited forms. For example, courts have held that requiring a movie producer to submit a film for rating prior to showing it publicly is a constitutional exercise of government power despite the strong presumption against the legality of prior restraints.\nGovernment may not censor expression in public forums\nControversy sometimes arises when publicly owned space is used for exhibitions or communication of art. The degree to which the government may censor such expression depends on the nature of the public space.\nIn traditionally public spaces set aside for the exchange of ideas, like public parks, the government may not completely ban artistic expression unless it has a compelling interest that cannot be accomplished through less restrictive m\nDoc 4(Title: eopolitics of oil.)

It mentions that the demand for oil is expected to peak before 2030 according to BP scenarios, but other estimates suggest it might not happen until after 2030. The information also touches on the role of oil in various sectors beyond transportation, such as petrochemicals and fertilizers, indicating that reducing oil consumption is complex and multifaceted.\n\nHowever, the main point regarding the Paris Climate Agreement is that it does not directly ban or limit oil production, but it sets a framework for reducing emissions from production processes. Companies are exploring ways to reduce emissions through carbon capture and sequestration technologies. Some countries are even marketing low-emission oil, although the effectiveness of this strategy remains debatable.\n\nGiven this context, the Paris Climate Agreement is not a dead letter, but it faces significant challenges in achieving its goals due to the ongoing demand for oil and the complexity of transitioning away from fossil fuels. The best scenario for reducing dependence on fossil fuels would involve a combination of technological advancements, policy changes, and international cooperation to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources.\n</think>\n\nBased on the information provided, the Paris Climate Agreement is not a dead letter but faces challenges in achieving its goals.

    "question": "Should there be a US law allowing not more than 2 children per couple, in order to stabilize U.S. population?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it's evident that the U.S. is experiencing a significant shift towards religious unaffiliation, particularly among younger generations. This trend is expected to continue, with the number of Christians declining and the unaffiliated becoming the largest religious group by 2070. This demographic shift is driven by several factors, including intergenerational transmission, switching rates, and fertility rates.\n\nImplementing a law that limits families to two children would not directly address the core issues contributing to the declining birth rate and the shift towards religious unaffiliation. Instead, it might have unintended social and economic consequences, such as reducing the overall population and workforce size, which could impact economic growth and social services.\n\nTherefore, <answer> a law limiting families to two children is not a suitable solution to stabilize the U.S. population. </answer>",

We try to address this not with sweeping predictions or grand theories, but with mathematical projections that combine techniques standardly used in demography (the study of human populations) with data we have collected in surveys on religion.) Demographers project the growth or shrinkage of populations based on factors such as age, sex, fertility, mortality and migration. For religious populations, projections also need to include data on “switching” – voluntary movement into and out of religious groups. Finally, the shifting sizes of U.S. religious groups depend partly on rates of religious transmission – whether parents pass their religious identity on to their children. In this report, Pew Research Center has incorporated estimates of “intergenerational transmission of religion” into our projections for the first time.\nSwitching rates are estimated based on responses from more than 15,000 adults to two questions posed in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey: “In what religion, if any, were you raised?” and “What is your present religion, if any?” Results were weighted to the Center’s National Public Opinion Reference Survey, conducted by mail and online in 2020. Long-term cohort trends in switching (going back to the 1970s) come from two similar questions in the long-running General Social Survey: “In what religion were you raised?” and “What is your religious preference?”\nShifts in religious identity, or switching, are concentrated among young adults. During earlier childhood years, a parent’s religion (or lack thereof) is often, but not always, transmitted to a child. Rates of transmission for three identity categories (Christian, other religion, and religiously unaffiliated) are estimated based on the percentages of teens (ages 13 to 17) who shared their mother’s religious affiliation in a 2019 survey of 1,811 pairs of U.S. parents and teens. These observed patterns are used to model whether future generations of newborn children inherit their mother’s religion.\nGroup differences in fertility (the number of children women tend to have), migration and age structures also drive change. Fertility differences by religion are based on the National Survey of Family Growth, while the average U.S. fertility rate used in each period is based on the 2019 revision of United Nations World Populations Prospect data. Migration data comes from the UN. Religious composition by age and sex groups is based on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel. We estimate the religious composition of children based on the religious composition of young adults, and fertility patterns.\nThe various input data is used in projection models to illustrate what the future religious composition of the U.S. might look like under a range of hypothetical scenarios. See Methodology for more information on inputs and modeling.\nSince the 1990s, large numbers of Americans have left Christianity to join the growing ranks of U.S. adults who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular.” This accelerating trend is reshaping the U.S. religious landscape, leading many people to wonder what the future of religion in America might look like.\nWhat if Christians keep leaving religion at the same rate observed in recent years? What if the pace of religious switching continues to accelerate? What if switching were to stop, but other demographic trends – such as migration, births and deaths – were to continue at current rates? To help answer such questions, Pew Research Center has modeled several hypothetical scenarios describing how the U.S. religious landscape might change over the next half century.\nThe Center estimates that in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones,” acc\nDoc 2(Title: e the study’s model – such as war, economic depression, climate crisis, changing immigration patterns or religious innovations – could reverse current religious switching trends, leading to a revival of Christianity in the United States. But there are no current switching patterns in the U.S. that can be factored into the mathematical models to project such a result.) None of these hypothetical scenarios is certain to unfold exactly as modeled, but collectively they demonstrate how much impact switching could have on the overall population’s religious composition within a few decades. The four main scenarios, combined with four alternatives outlined in Chapter 2, show that rates of religious switching in adulthood appear to have a far greater impact on the overall religious composition of the United States than other factors that can drive changes in affiliation over time, such as fertility rates and intergenerational transmission (i.e., how many parents pass their religion to their children).\nThe decline of Christianity and the rise of the “nones” may have complex causes and far-reaching consequences for politics, family life and civil society. However, theories about the root causes of religious change and speculation about its societal impact are not the focus of this report. The main contribution of this study is to analyze recent trends and show how the U.S. religious landscape would shift if they continued.\nThis report focuses on Christians and the religiously unaffiliated, the two most common, very broad religious identities in the United States today. People with all other religious affiliations are combined into an umbrella category that includes Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and a diverse array of smaller groups that together make up about 6% of the U.S. population. In 2015, Pew Research Center projected the growth of several of these groups separately, both in the U.S. and around the world, and the Center may do so again in the future. But, because data on religious switching and intergenerational transmission is less reliable for groups with small sample sizes in surveys, non-Christian groups are not shown separately in this report.\nThe report also does not project change for subgroups of Christians, such as Protestants and Catholics, or for subgroups of “nones,” such as atheists, agnostics and people who describe their religion as “nothing in particular.” For the latest figures on the religious composition of the U.S., including some subgroups, see our 2021 report, “About Three-in-Ten U.S. Adults Are Now Religiously Unaffiliated.”\nScenario assumptions and projection results\nThe four main scenarios presented here vary primarily in their assumptions about the future of religious switching among Americans between the ages of 15 and 29 – which are the years when most religious change happens. Only a modest amount of switching is modeled among older adults.\nFertility and mortality rates are held steady, as are rates of intergenerational transmission. In each scenario, the groups begin with their current profiles in terms of age and gender. Christians, for example, are older than the religiously unaffiliated, on average, and include a higher share of women.\nFinally, the models assume that migration remains constant, which helps explain why non-Christian groups follow the same trajectory in each of the four scenarios. Immigration has an outsized effect on the composition of non-Christian groups in the U.S. because adherents of religions like Islam and Hinduism make up a larger share of new arrivals than they do of the existing U.S. population.\nChapter 2 presents four additional scenarios that explore the impact of the factors held constant here. These additional projections show how the U.S. religious landscape might change if current switching patterns held steady, but intergenerational religious transmission occurred in 100% of cases; there were no fertility differences by religion; there was no switching after age 3\nDoc 3(Title: Abstract) This paper analyzes four trends that are affecting the 2016 election: changing US demographics and the reaction to them, a growing distrust of government, increased polarization and government gridlock, and the rise of populism. It compares the views of candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald S. Trump on the Affordable Care Act, climate change, prescription drug pricing, prevention of injuries and deaths from firearms, and the opioids epidemic; and offers perspectives on the potential impact of the election not only on U.S. health care policy, but on the health of American democracy itself.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis manuscript is based on the Betty and Herb Dupont Lecture at the Americal Clinical and Climatological Association on October 22, 2016. For the lecture, I conducted an extensive evidence review, mainly through Google, on the trends influencing the 2016 election, and on the election’s potential impact on US health care policy. This manuscript describes the findings of my evidence review, interprets and analyzes them, and offers perspectives on the implications not only for US health care but also the health of American democracy. Because the lecture took place prior to the November 8 election, this paper does not specifically comment on the results of the election, although the perspectives offered on how Donald S. Trump’s positions as a candidate, compared to those of former Secretary of State Hillary R. Rodham, are relevant to any conversation about what Mr. Trump’s election and continued Republican control of Congress bodes for health care policy.\nINTRODUCTION\nHunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, which chronicled the 1972 Nixon versus McGovern campaign, was described by the New York Times as “the best account yet published” of a modern American presidential campaign (1). “What makes the story so painful, and so painfully funny” writes Matt Taibbi in his introduction to the book’s 40th anniversary edition, “is that Hunter chooses the presidential campaign, of all places, to conduct this hopeless search for truth and justice. It’s probably worse now than it was in Hunter’s day, but the American presidential campaign is the last place in the world a sane man would go in search of anything like honesty. It may be the most fake place on earth” (2).\nThe same might be said of the 2016 election; an election characterized by personal attacks, misinformation, and relentless negativity, as voters are being asked to choose between two major party candidates who most distrust and view unfavorably—a “lesser of two evils” choice to many. This isn’t the first “lesser evils” election; in Fear and Loathing, Hunter wrote, “How many more of these stinking, double-downer sideshows will we have to go through before we can get ourselves straight enough to put together some kind of national election that will give me and the at least 20 million people I tend to agree with a chance to vote FOR something, instead of always being faced with that old familiar choice between the lesser of two evils?” (1)\nYet, like the choices or not, the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or businessman Donald S. Trump will result in starkly different outcomes for America’s health care system. It’s not just health care that is at stake; it’s the health of our democratic system of government itself.\nThe anger and distrust evidenced by large swaths of the electorate today, and the poisonous atmosphere that it has introduced into the election, didn’t just suddenly arise. It came about because of four trends—reactions to changing demographics; distrust of government; partisanship and gridlock; and now, populism—that have been gathering steam for decades, only to come to a head in this election.\nCHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS\n“The U.S. electorate this year will be the country’s most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Nearly one-in-three eligible voters on Election Day (31%) will be Hispanic, black, Asian o\nDoc 4(Title: s held constant here. These additional projections show how the U.S. religious landscape might change if current switching patterns held steady, but intergenerational religious transmission occurred in 100% of cases; there were no fertility differences by religion; there was no switching after age 30; or there was no migration after 2020.) The alternative scenarios are intended to help isolate – and thereby illuminate – the impact of various factors. One might think of the projections as an experiment in which some key drivers of religious composition change are turned on or off, sped up or slowed down, to see how much difference they make. For more information about modeling assumptions and results, see Chapter 2 and the Methodology.\nScenario 1: Steady switching – Christians would lose their majority but would still be the largest U.S. religious group in 2070\nSwitching assumption: Switching into and out of Christianity, other religions and the religiously unaffiliated category (“nones”) continues among young Americans (ages 15 to 29) at the same rates as in recent years. Most significantly, each new generation sees 31% of people who were raised Christian become religiously unaffiliated by the time they reach 30, while 21% of those who grew up with no religion become Christian.\nOutcome: If switching among young Americans continued at recent rates, Christians would decline as a share of the population by a few percentage points per decade, dipping below 50% by 2060. In 2070, 46% of Americans would identify as Christian, making Christianity a plurality – the most common religious identity – but no longer a majority. In this scenario, the share of “nones” would not climb above 41% by 2070.\nScenario 2: Rising disaffiliation with limits – ‘nones’ would be the largest group in 2070 but not a majority\nSwitching assumption: Continuing a recent pattern, switching out of Christianity becomes more common among young Americans as each generation sees a progressively larger share of Christians leave religion by the age of 30. However, brakes are applied to keep Christian retention (the share of people raised as Christians who remain Christian) from falling below about 50%.3 At the same time, switching into Christianity becomes less and less common, also continuing recent trends.\nOutcome: If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up initially but then hold steady, Christians would lose their majority status by 2050, when they would be 47% of the U.S. population (versus 42% for the unaffiliated). In 2070, “nones” would constitute a plurality of 48%, and Christians would account for 39% of Americans.\nScenario 3: Rising disaffiliation without limits – ‘nones’ would form a slim majority in 2070\nSwitching assumption: The share of Christians who disaffiliate by the time they reach 30 continues to rise with each successive generation, and rates of disaffiliation are allowed to continue rising even after Christian retention drops below 50% (i.e., no limit is imposed). As in Scenario 2, switching into Christianity among young Americans becomes less and less common.\nOutcome: If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up throughout the projection period without any brakes, Christians would no longer be a majority by 2045. By 2055, the unaffiliated would make up the largest group (46%), ahead of Christians (43%). In 2070, 52% of Americans would be unaffiliated, while a little more than a third (35%) would be Christian.\nScenario 4: No switching – Christians would retain their majority through 2070\nSwitching assumption: This scenario imagines no person in America has changed or will change their religion after 2020. But even in that hypothetical situation, the religious makeup of the U.S. population would continue to shift gradually, primarily as a result of Christians being older than other groups, on average, and the unaffiliated being younger, with a larger share of their population of childbearing age.\nOutcome: If sw\nDoc 5(Title: n that hypothetical situation, the religious makeup of the U.S. population would continue to shift gradually, primarily as a result of Christians being older than other groups, on average, and the unaffiliated being younger, with a larger share of their population of childbearing age.) Outcome: If switching had stopped altogether in 2020, the share of Christians would still decline by 10 percentage points over 50 years, reaching 54% in 2070. The unaffiliated would remain a substantial minority, at 34%.\nWhich scenario is most plausible?\nThe scenarios in this report present a wide range of assumptions and outcomes. Readers may wonder which scenario is most plausible. While there are endless possibilities that would lead to religious composition change that is different from the plotted trajectories, it may be helpful to consider how closely the hypothetical switching scenarios adhere to real, observed trends.\nThe “no switching” scenario (No. 4) is not realistic – switching has not ended and there is no reason to think it will come to an abrupt stop. The purpose of this scenario is to show the influence of demographic factors (such as age and fertility) on religious affiliation rates. Still, if fewer future young adults switch from Christianity to no affiliation, or if movement in the opposite direction increases, the future religious landscape might resemble the results of this projection.\nThe “steady switching” scenario (No. 1) is conservative. It depicts moderate, steady “net” switching (taking into consideration some partially offsetting movement in both directions) away from Christianity among young adults for the foreseeable future, rather than the extension of a decades-long trend of increasing disaffiliation across younger cohorts. Even long-standing trends can be unsustainable or otherwise temporary, and this scenario best represents what would happen if the recent period of rising attrition from Christianity is winding down or already has ended.\nBy contrast, the scenario of rising disaffiliation without limits (No. 3) assumes there is a kind of ever-increasing momentum behind religious switching. The visible rise of the unaffiliated might induce more and more young people to leave Christianity and further increase the “stickiness” of an unaffiliated upbringing, so that fewer and fewer people raised without a religion would take on a religious identity at a later point in their lives.\nIntergenerational transmission is the passing of religious identity from parents to children. It occurs (or fails to occur) in childhood. In this study, transmission rates are calculated based on the share of children who inherit their mother’s religion (or their mother’s unaffiliated identity) because mothers tend to successfully transmit their religious identities more often than fathers do. Also, roughly a quarter of children under 18 live in single-parent households, which are overwhelmingly headed by mothers.\nThe Center’s data shows the vast majority of teens (about 85%) have the same religious identity as their mother, while 16% report a different identity. Religious transmission, as measured in this study, can fail to occur for many reasons and in either direction. For example, if a mother doesn’t identify with any religion but her 14-year-old child identifies as Christian, it’s counted as a non-transmission of religious identity – just as it would for a Christian mother with a religiously unaffiliated teen.\nIntergenerational transmission differs from switching because it describes what happens before the age of 15 and is measured by comparing the religious affiliation of mothers with the affiliations reported by their teenage children. Switching, by contrast, describes a change that happens after the age of 15; it is measured by comparing the religions in which respondents say they were raised with the affiliations they report today.\nOn the other hand, highly religious parents tend to raise highly religious children who are less like\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it's evident that the U.S. is experiencing a significant shift towards religious unaffiliation, particularly among younger generations. This trend is expected to continue, with the number of Christians declining and the unaffiliated becoming the largest religious group by 2070. This demographic shift is driven by several factors, including intergenerational transmission, switching rates, and fertility rates.\n\nImplementing a law that limits families to two children would not directly address the core issues contributing to the declining birth rate and the shift towards religious unaffiliation. Instead, it might have unintended social and economic consequences, such as reducing the overall population and workforce size, which could impact economic growth and social services.\n\nTherefore, <answer> a law limiting families to two children is not a suitable solution to stabilize the U.S. population. </answer>",

The resolution authorized the United States to use military force to \"defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq\".\nWeapons of mass destruction\n[edit]The US government's belief that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the form of nuclear weapons was based upon intelligence which the CIA argued could not be trusted.[36] The CIA was overruled on its opinion on nuclear weapons as the administration sought outside information from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress (INC). Declassified CIA reports from 2002 suggested Iraq had begun production of other forms of WMDs in the form of chemical warfare agents such as mustard gas, sarin, Cyclosarin, and VX.[37]\nGeorge Bush, speaking in October 2002, said that \"The stated policy of the United States is regime change … However, if [Saddam Hussein] were to meet all the conditions of the United Nations, the conditions that I have described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed.\"[38] Similarly, in September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in an answer to a parliamentary question, that \"Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction\".[39] In November of that year, Blair further stated that \"So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not regime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime; I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people … so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, but on the other hand I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction; it is not regime change.\"[40]\nBetween September 2002 and May 2003, Bush administration began attempting to mix its \"war on terror\" rhetoric with weapons of mass destruction allegations, in addition to espousing allegations of Iraqi support to al-Qaeda.[41] In his 2003 State of the Union address delivered on 28 January 2003, George W.

    "question": "Are electric cars impractical?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information gathered, it appears that there are several reasons why electric cars might be considered impractical:\n\n1. **High Initial Cost**: Electric cars are generally more expensive than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. This can be a barrier for many consumers, particularly those in lower-income brackets.\n\n2. **Limited Charging Infrastructure**: Many areas, especially in rural or low-income regions, lack sufficient charging stations. This can make it difficult for some people to use electric cars regularly.\n\n3. **Range Anxiety**: Electric cars often have shorter ranges compared to gasoline-powered cars, which can limit their practicality for long trips or in areas with limited charging infrastructure.\n\n4. **Environmental Concerns**: While electric cars produce fewer emissions during operation, the electricity used to charge them often comes from sources that emit pollutants. Additionally, the production of electric cars can be more resource-intensive, potentially leading to environmental issues.\n\n5. **Cold Weather Issues**: Electric vehicles can experience reduced performance and range in colder climates, which can be a significant inconvenience for some users.\n\n6. **Reliability Concerns**: Some studies suggest that electric vehicles may have reliability issues and higher repair costs compared to traditional cars.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these issues are being addressed through technological advancements and policy changes. For instance, the range of electric cars is improving, and the number of charging stations is increasing, especially in urban areas. Therefore, while electric cars may currently be impractical for some, this situation is not static and is expected to change as technology and infrastructure develop.\n\nBased on the current state of technology and infrastructure, <answer> electric cars can be impractical for some consumers, particularly those in rural areas or with lower incomes, due to high costs, limited charging infrastructure, and range limitations. However, these challenges are expected to diminish as technology advances and infrastructure improves. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> To properly address this question, I need to consider several factors such as the current state of technology, environmental impact, cost, range, and charging infrastructure for electric cars compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.</think>\n\n<search> practicality of electric cars </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Poll: A majority of Americans think electric cars are impractical) A recent survey from Rassmussen has found that most Americans, 52 percent, think that electric vehicles (EVs) are impractical and don’t expect them to replace gasoline-powered cars any time soon. Only 25 percent of Americans said they felt that EVs were practical for most drivers.\nThe poll results are not surprising. EVs make up only a tiny fraction of auto sales every year, and a study in California found that 18 percent of EV drivers switched back to gasoline due to difficulties charging the cars.\nThese challenges are becoming more pronounced. Electricity shortages in California have resulted in the grid operator pleading with residents not to charge their cars from 4-9 p.m. when electricity demand increases, but power generation from solar panels declines with the setting sun.\nGiven the reluctance of consumers to embrace EVs, it doesn’t make much sense for Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to impose California’s EV mandates, which would require auto manufacturers to stock 14,000 new EVs in our state each year.\nRather than trying to artificially manufacture demand for a product that most people don’t want, the Walz administration should respect the rights of Minnesotans to choose the car or truck that best suits their needs without forcing them to pay extra money to help subsidize the cost of someone else’s Tesla.\nDoc 2(Title: President Biden’s latest push for electric vehicles, or EVs, is reminiscent of a soliloquy by Don Quixote: short on facts, long on rhetoric, and filled with unrealistic expectations. Sadly, though, Mr. Biden’s policy mistakes are moving beyond fiction to a reality that confines consumers to cars that are unaffordable and unwanted.) Like Don Quixote tilting at harmless windmills he thinks are giants, Mr. Biden is attacking American energy and the auto industry for daring to use fossil fuels. And as Don Quixote went from quest to quest attempting to free imaginary prisoners, Mr. Biden is hellbent on freeing Americans from the imaginary captivity of their reliable, safe, flexible and economical gasoline- and diesel-fueled engines.\nThat disconnect from reality perfectly encapsulates Mr. Biden’s energy policy. His Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed such strict regulations for cars and trucks that effectively mean that 54% of new vehicles sold domestically must be EVs by 2030.\nEven if Mr. Biden managed a 500% increase in EV sales by the end of the decade, he’d still fall woefully short of his goal. The only conceivable way to make half of new vehicle sales EVs by 2030 would be if Americans were so poor that they could afford very few new cars, and thus the small number of EVs could still amount to half of all new vehicles. That’s right out of Mao’s Great Leap Forward.\n>>> Emissions-free Electric Vehicles Are a Fantasy\nJust from the standpoint of raw materials, Mr. Biden’s EV goal is fictitious. We simply cannot get the needed materials in sufficient volume in time. Furthermore, the schizophrenic energy policy of this administration is simultaneously ramping up demand for those raw materials while hamstringing the supply. Mr. Biden continues blocking mining of lithium, graphite, nickel and rare earth metals.\nThat’s inexplicable, since Mr. Biden’s green energy transition would increase demand for those materials by 4,200%, 2,500%, 1,900% and 700%, respectively, in less than 20 years.\nBut when you consider that “it has taken on average over 16 years to move mining projects from discovery to first production,” then Biden’s proposals aren’t unachievable—they’re laughable.\nAnd from where does Mr. Biden think the electricity to power these EVs will come? The strained electrical grid already has brownouts and blackouts in parts of the country and couldn’t handle millions more EVs, especially when Mr. Biden is also blocking copper mining, the main ingredient in electrical wires.\nThe grid’s transmission capacity would need to grow 60% in less than seven years and grow 200% in less than 30 years. And this is just the grid infrastructure, not what would be needed to power it.\nThe Biden administration repeatedly refers to EVs as zero-emission vehicles, as if the electricity powering them did not have emissions. EVs are powered primarily by fossil fuels, not just because fossil fuels generate much of our electricity but because they are dispatchable, meaning their electrical output can be ramped up and down in response to demand.\nConversely, wind and solar generate electricity only when conditions are right, regardless of demand, and nuclear power needs to stay at a very steady output to be efficient. That leaves coal and natural gas (and oil on rare occasions) to be the real workhorses of electrical generation. When everyone needs to cool their homes and offices at the same time, or charge their EVs, coal and natural gas throttle up.\nMr. Biden’s plan merely shifts emissions from one location to another. Instead of carbon dioxide leaving a tailpipe, it will leave a smokestack. Either climate change isn’t a global problem, or the president is taking the saying “out of sight, out of mind” too literally.\nWorse, America is dependent on countries such as China when it comes to EVs, and those countries will receive a windfall under Mr. Biden’s centrally planned industrial policy.\n>>> The Case Against Electric Vehicles\nChina will soon cont\nDoc 3(Title: Turning into Redwood’s west parking lot in my dad’s navy blue Toyota Camry, I crane my neck to gaze at the four electric car charging stations situated across from the main office. The charging stations, along with the various electric car models using them, serve as a reminder of an unrealistic aspiration my family has had for the past half year.) Last May, as my birthday crept up on me and my twin brother, my parents began contemplating car options that would accommodate transportation for the entire family. We quickly realized the financial burden two licenses with insurance would have on our budget (my brother and I are still car-less), but the conversation about different vehicle options led my family to look into electric cars.\nUnfortunately, without a garage at either of my parents’ apartments, and therefore no charging outlet available, buying an electric car would be an impractical investment. With the generally high cost of electric cars combined with the inability to charge the car overnight or while at home, my parents scrapped our vision of an environmentally friendly car in our parking space.\nMy family’s situation emulates the struggle of apartment-dwellers in addition to lower-income families in California, a state which boasts the highest usage of e-cars in the United States per 1,000 people, according to InsideEVs.com. In 2019 alone, electric car sales have skyrocketed 63.7 percent according to the Los Angeles Times. Despite California’s massive increase in electric car sales in recent years, electric vehicle options for low-income families have remained insufficient and must improve soon for the betterment of our environment.\nIn general, electric cars are more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts, which makes it a challenge for low-income families to purchase zero emission vehicles. According to Edmunds, an online car research company, the most affordable electric cars range from $31,000 to $40,000, whereas numerous hybrid options (such as the 2019 Toyota Prius) are listed lower than $25,000. Naturally, gas cars are often cheaper; the 2019 Chevrolet Cruze, for example, is listed at just under $18,000.\nAdditionally, many families’ ability to charge an electric car is hindered by living in apartments where the charging process is inconvenient. Charging an electric vehicle at home requires an outlet from which owners can charge their cars with a portable charger. The vast majority of apartment-dwellers do not park in individual garages, and are therefore without outlets.\nMoreover, California’s public charging stations are concentrated predominantly around the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Outside of these two hubs for electric transportation, electric car chargers are dismally sporadic, sometimes located close to one hundred miles before the next station.\nThe evident scarcity of electric charging stations outside of the Bay Area and L.A. is an unfortunate indication of California’s failure to ensure electric car usage in low-income areas. Despite promoting state-wide environmentally friendly initiatives in past years, California has only established sufficient amounts of electric charging stations in the wealthiest areas of the state.\nFor instance, if the California legislature wishes to meet it’s 2030 goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent, charging options need to be available for low-income families and charging stations must be more evenly distributed throughout the state.\nProponents of electric car use may argue that while the initial price of electric cars may be more expensive, the cost of their future maintenance is much lower than gas cars. A study conducted by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Institute in 2018 found that electric cars, on average, cost less than half as much to operate than gas-powered cars. This stems from the fact that gas cars require frequent refuelings in addition to oil changes. However, electri\nDoc 4(Title: cars. A study conducted by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Institute in 2018 found that electric cars, on average, cost less than half as much to operate than gas-powered cars. This stems from the fact that gas cars require frequent refuelings in addition to oil changes. However, electric cars still need brake, battery and motor maintenance. More significantly, the inadequate and infrequent amount of charging stations in low-income areas can make charging an electric car challenging, whereas gas stations are abundant throughout California.) Ultimately, this issue is an excellent representation of how economic injustices can stifle environmental change. Similar to how it is difficult for low-income families to purchase sustainable and organic food, the sheer price and lack of available charging for electric vehicles prevent many families from purchasing an electric car.\nIt can be easy for me to be blinded by Marin’s great environmental consciousness and abundance of electric vehicles, but positive environmental progression requires money. It is time California begins to make environmentally friendly options in transportation available for low-income individuals all across the state. California may be the forerunner in environmental consciousness in America, but clearly, massive steps must be taken in the future to ensure that all Californians can participate in our mission for a lower carbon footprint, regardless of income or housing status.\nDoc 5(Title: Stopping Biden’s Radical Forced EV Transition) Americans Should Choose the Car They Drive\nPresident Biden and Democrats are leading a radical rush-to-green agenda that takes away people’s vehicle choice and forces Americans to drive electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are unaffordable and unrealistic for many Americans and a reliance on EVs cedes U.S. leadership to the Chinese Communist Party.\nAmericans don’t want President Biden’s aggressive EV mandates—they want to choose what vehicle best suits their needs.\nThat’s exactly what nearly 5,000 American car dealers told President Biden—twice—after EVs stacked up on their lots. They’re demanding the Biden administration “hit the brakes” on its unrealistic agenda.\nElectric vehicles continue to be more expensive than other alternatives and aren’t practical for many Americans—especially those living in rural communities. Furthermore, despite allocating $7.5 billion in 2021 to speed up its forced EV transition, the Biden administration just got its first vehicle charger up and running in Ohio one month ago. Hertz, a major rental car company, recently announced its plan to sell 20,000 electric vehicles and buy gas-powered cars instead.\nAdditionally, according to a recent study by Consumer Reports, EVs have almost 80 percent more issues and are generally less reliable than vehicles with internal combustion engines. Earlier this month, electric vehicles across the country were failing to charge—or keep a charged battery—as a result of cold weather. Electric vehicles lose an average of 41 percent of their range when temperatures drop to 20 degrees Fahrenheit. As reported by Fox Business, in Chicago, “charging stations essentially turned into car graveyards as temperatures have dropped.”\nThis forced EV transition also plays right into China’s hands. China controls the vast majority of critical minerals mining, processing, and manufacturing for electric vehicles. China has 78 percent of the world’s cell manufacturing capacity for EV batteries. To further their grip on EV technology against America, China implemented export controls on graphite, the single largest mineral component of any EV battery, on December 1, 2023. There is currently only one graphite-producing mine in North America.\nPolicy experts across the board are sounding the alarm on the national security consequences of Biden’s forced EV transition and how it will strengthen China’s foothold in the American auto industry for decades to come. More than a dozen former senior military officials recently warned President Biden that his rush-to-green agenda “will undoubtedly open the U.S. up to economic manipulations by China, identical to what Russia is doing with Ukrainian grain exports, and [poses] a major threat to our national security.”\nSenior administration officials, like U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, are also raising concerns about Chinese influence over the electric vehicle market, recently stating in a letter to President Biden that “China has developed and implemented a plan to target the EV sector for dominance.”\nEnergy and Commerce Republicans are leading to stop the administration’s radical EV agenda, preserve people’s vehicle choice, and ensure America—not China—is leading:\n- H.R. 1435, the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, led by Rep. John Joyce (R-PA), protects America’s automotive future by stopping California and President Biden from dictating the vehicles Americans can drive. The bill passed the House in September 2023, by a bipartisan vote of 222-190.\n- H.R. 4468, the Choice in Automobile Retail Sales (CARS) Act of 2023, led by Reps. Tim Walberg (R-MI) and Andrew Clyde (R-GA), prevents the Biden administration from imposing a de facto EV mandate and ceding America’s auto future to China. The bill passed the House in December 2023, by a bipartisan vote of 221-197.\n- H.R. 4469, the No Fuel Credits for Batteries Act of 2023, led by Rep.

This can be a barrier for many consumers, particularly those in lower-income brackets.\n\n2. **Limited Charging Infrastructure**: Many areas, especially in rural or low-income regions, lack sufficient charging stations. This can make it difficult for some people to use electric cars regularly.\n\n3. **Range Anxiety**: Electric cars often have shorter ranges compared to gasoline-powered cars, which can limit their practicality for long trips or in areas with limited charging infrastructure.\n\n4. **Environmental Concerns**: While electric cars produce fewer emissions during operation, the electricity used to charge them often comes from sources that emit pollutants. Additionally, the production of electric cars can be more resource-intensive, potentially leading to environmental issues.\n\n5. **Cold Weather Issues**: Electric vehicles can experience reduced performance and range in colder climates, which can be a significant inconvenience for some users.\n\n6. **Reliability Concerns**: Some studies suggest that electric vehicles may have reliability issues and higher repair costs compared to traditional cars.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these issues are being addressed through technological advancements and policy changes. For instance, the range of electric cars is improving, and the number of charging stations is increasing, especially in urban areas. Therefore, while electric cars may currently be impractical for some, this situation is not static and is expected to change as technology and infrastructure develop.\n\nBased on the current state of technology and infrastructure, <answer> electric cars can be impractical for some consumers, particularly those in rural areas or with lower incomes, due to high costs, limited charging infrastructure, and range limitations. However, these challenges are expected to diminish as technology advances and infrastructure improves. </answer>",

    "question": "Should schools and compulsory education not be compulsory?",
    "agent_answer": "From the documents provided, there are strong arguments both for and against compulsory education:\n\nFor compulsory education:\n- Ensures that all children have access to basic education, reducing disparities in educational attainment.\n- Helps prevent illiteracy and child labor.\n- Instills discipline and structure, preparing children for adult life.\n- Encourages public interest and traditions in education.\n\nAgainst compulsory education:\n- May infringe on individual liberty and personal choice.\n- Could result in lost earnings for students who need to work to support their families.\n- May not be suitable for all students, potentially leading to frustration and wasted potential.\n- Does not guarantee improved educational outcomes or reduced inequality.\n\nThe debate highlights the complexity of the issue and the importance of considering the unique circumstances and needs of each student.\n</think>\n\n<answer> No, schools and compulsory education should not be made non-compulsory.

Making it non-compulsory would likely lead to disparities in educational attainment, with poorer and disadvantaged families being less likely to send their children to school.\n\nHowever, the concept of compulsory education does raise questions about how to best deliver education and whether there are more effective ways to ensure that all children receive adequate schooling.\n</think>\n\n<search> benefits and drawbacks of making schools and compulsory education non-compulsory </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: ommunist societies suffer from no such inconsistency: they try to teach their children command and obedience, and their educational system is consistent with inculcating this ethic.”) We send a mixed message to our children when we say we live in a free land, and then force them into a ridged, centralized, impersonal school system.\nBut what about those who choose not to attend school? Students who choose to not show up and not do the subject matter will quickly learn the real-life consequences of failure to work and achieve. On the other hand, students who can learn the material outside of school and demonstrate initiative in taking their education upon themselves, should not be forced to sit in a classroom watching others learn what they already know.\nThomas Jefferson addressed the failure of a parent to educate his child when he said:\n“It is better to tolerate the rare instance of a parent refusing to let his child be educated, than to shock the common feelings and ideas by the forcible asportation and education of the infant against the will of the father.” -Thomas Jefferson: Note to Elementary School Act, 1817, ME 17:423\nEnding compulsory education and truancy laws will not be the destruction of public education. It is only the restoration of the natural rights of self-government that have been taken away from the people. The people deserve some choice in what their children learn and who teaches them.\nThe bottom line is, are we willing to live by principles of liberty and individual agency, or continue to embrace the fears that education requires compulsion because free will is too dangerous to leave to chance?\nWe should let students experience freedom in the classroom and understand how choice benefits them now, and they will respect choice and freedom for others when their time to lead arrives.\nIn closing, this quote from Frederick Bastiat’s writings in “The Law” seems fitting.\n“God has given to men all that is necessary for them to accomplish their destinies… persons are so constituted that they will develop themselves harmoniously in the clean air of liberty… Away with their artificial systems…the whims of governmental administrators, their socialized projects, their government schools, their state religions…\nAnd now that the legislators and do-gooders have so futilely inflicted so many systems upon society, may they finally end where they should have begun: May they reject all systems, and try liberty; for liberty is an acknowledgment of faith in God and His works.”\nPlease speak with your legislators today about supporting Senator Aaron Osmond’s bill to end compulsory education. It will be run during the 2014 Utah legislative session.\nFor additional videos and information please visit these pages:\nEnding Compulsory Education Presentation\nIn this 30 minute presentation by Oak Norton on ending compulsory education, he gives a brief history of where it came from, who is behind it, and why it needs to be removed.

Subtitled, “renewing accountability for parents and respect for educators,” Aaron lays out a few reasons compulsory education interferes with what should be a more market-based approach that involves mutual respect between parties.\nDoc 2(Title: f nuisances. Now, ignorance is as noxious as the most offensive nuisance, and more destructive than bodily contagions.) It is un-American and unadapted to our free institutions. To put the question in the most offensive form, it may be asked, \"Would you have policemen drag your children to school?\" I answer, \"Yes, if it will prevent his dragging them to jail a few years hence.\"\nCompulsory education is monarchical in its origin and history. Common as is this impression it is erroneous....Before the peace of Westphalia, before Prussia existed as a kingdom, and while Frederick William was only \"elector of Brandenburg,\" Connecticut adopted coercive education.\nAttendance would be just as large without the law as it is now. It may be so. But so far from being an objection, this fact is strong proof of the efficiency of that law which has itself helped create so healthful a public sentiment. Were the law to be abrogated to-morrow the individual and general interest in public education would remain. The same might have been said of Connecticut for more than 170 years after the adoption of compulsory education. During all that period a native of this State of mature age unable to read the English language would have been looked upon as a prodigy. Still, in Connecticut as well as in Germany, it was the law itself which greatly aided in awakening public interest and in fixing the habits, associations, and traditions of the people.\nPerhaps the syntax of 1872 was so different from that of today that it has rendered the last two of Northrop's refutations beyond interpretation, but they would seem to argue against the points he was trying to make, especially his use of the word \"coercive\". In those two paragraphs, however, he clearly gave credit to Germany (and Prussia before it became just a region) as the model for government schools in the United States.\nWhatever their ambiguities, however, those ringing words of Northrop have formed the basis of the defense of compulsory education for some 125 years.\nWhy Compulsory Education was Deemed Necessary\nNot many writers have been as honest as Troen (1976) who, in his study of the history of the St. Louis schools, pointed out that while by 1940 about half the children remained in school through age seventeen, \"This change did not come about only through the attractiveness of the new programs and the system's efforts at persuasion; compulsion was also necessary\" (p. 200).\nTwo of the reasons commonly cited for the establishment of compulsory education were illiteracy and child labor. These concepts are so frequently intertwined that it is nearly impossible to separate them. As Good (1956) said:\nUniversal literacy was until yesterday largely theory. Child labor was favored by parents, condoned by the public, and welcomed by business and agriculture. Many children did not get to attend the schools for the short terms during which they were open. They did not have the opportunity to learn the simple literacy which to many of the founding fathers seemed sufficient. If this seems a harsh indictment, it is truth which makes it so. (p.374)\nHe went on to say that in the census of 1840 \"More than 50,000 white illiterates were found in each of several states....[and] over the country, newspapers commented upon the admission by 500,000 white Americans that they were unable to read and write\" (p.383). However, even after some 75 years of compulsory education, \"Of the 18,000,000 men who were called up in World War II, 5,000,000 were rejected for physical, mental, and educational reasons, one-seventh, or 700,000 for 'mental deficiency,' which was largely educational deficiency\" (Good, 1956, p. 385).\nThe census question about literacy was changed in 1940 to ask the respondent how many years of schooling he had completed. It was assumed that five years of schooling would produce a literate person.\nResearch done by Randall in New York in 1871, three years before compulsory education legislation was passed in that st\nDoc 3(Title: that would lose the young people who are already performing service by contributing to household income, babysitting for neighbors, or caring for sick relatives.[33][34]) Compulsory service would also delay people’s entry into the workforce, resulting in significant lost earnings that for some are desperately needed to keep multiple generations of a family afloat.

They’ve become disappointed in the huge cost and the harm done by unmotivated and underpaid teachers. There have always been alternatives to the standard education path, such as home schooling, or, since the 1960’s, alternative schooling options such as Montessori schools. As a home-schooled kid myself, and now as an undergrad studying teaching, you could say that I have lot of my personality invested in this battle! In this article, I examine the pros and cons of these alternatives to mainstream schooling.) Home Schooling\nAny schooling is a school of hard knocks. And being thrown into the jungle is the best way to understand how things work. Being home schooled, and now as an adult, I have come to realize that you cannot expect someone or something to do your job for you. You have to do it yourself. If you have a problem, you have to find a solution. You have to be motivated to learn and to explore. And you have to be willing to take risks.\nI have always been interested in how things work, and during my home-schooling, I was encouraged to explore to find the answer for myself. And I found that I could take things apart and put them back together again. It wasn’t until the age of 15 that I met a mechanic, one of my dad’s friends. He showed me how to take apart and rebuild a motor one afternoon, while they sipped suds and talked. I went home and taught myself to do it again, on the lawnmower engine. When I was 17, I had the opportunity to do the same with a car’s transmission. I taught myself how to change the fluid etc. This was my first real experience with learning a technical skill. And it was the beginning of a lifelong quest. It’s not very feminine but hey, it’s awful handy when you’re in a remote little town!\nAfter that, I went to university to study teaching, and I have come to realize that education is a skill in itself. And it is not the kind of skill that you can learn in a classroom. It is something that you have to learn in the real world and through practice. And as a home schooled kid, I learned this skill very early. It is the reason why I am so passionate about teaching today.\nEveryone has this concerned notion about the myth that home-schooled kids turn out weird. Well, if you look at the statistics, it’s just not true. But you also have to look at it from another angle. If you have a kid who does not want to learn, no matter what kind of schooling you give them, it’s not going to work. And no one would want to home school a kid who is a real pain in the butt. At least mainstream schooling has a system in place to deal with and socialize the problem kids. And the home schooled kids do not have such issues. So it really depends on the kid. If you have a weird kid, maybe they’re not going to fit into mainstream schooling. On the other hand, being thrown into the big jungle of school is probably going to socialize them and they will very rapidly learn to not be such a weirdo. So it swings both ways. Most of all, you want to do what is right for your own kid, and make sure there’s a balance of learning at a rate that is fast enough for the individual person, while at the same time not just becoming an academic at age 10, and, you know, learning to talk to other humans too.\nAlternative Schooling\nI think that alternative schooling is a good option for people who don’t want to home school their kids. I think that alternative schools are also a great idea for children who cannot cope with mainstream schooling. The Montessori Schools are a good example of this. As a home-schooled kid, I occasionally went to a Montessori school through my primary school years, and it was a good alternative. The school had a lot of freedom for the kids. They were able to explore and learn at their own rate. I had already learnt to read, write and do simple math at an early age, on account of my home schooling, and if I had j\nDoc 5(Title: advantages) -- are withdrawing from sort of the commons -- kids start going to private schools; kids start working out at private clubs instead of the public parks. An anti-government ideology then disinvests from those common goods and those things that draw us together. And that, in part, contributes to the fact that there’s less opportunity for our kids, all of our kids.\nNow, that’s not inevitable. A free market is perfectly compatible with also us making investment in good public schools, public universities; investments in public parks; investments in a whole bunch -- public infrastructure that grows our economy and spreads it around. But that’s, in part, what’s been under attack for the last 30 years. And so, in some ways, rather than soften the edges of the market, we’ve turbocharged it. And we have not been willing, I think, to make some of those common investments so that everybody can play a part in getting opportunity.\nNow, one other thing I’ve got to say about this is that even back in Bob’s day that was also happening. It’s just it was happening to black people. And so, in some ways, part of what’s changed is that those biases or those restrictions on who had access to resources that allowed them to climb out of poverty -- who had access to the firefighters job, who had access to the assembly line job, the blue-collar job that paid well enough to be in the middle class and then got you to the suburbs, and then the next generation was suddenly office workers -- all those things were foreclosed to a big chunk of the minority population in this country for decades.\nAnd that accumulated and built up. And over time, people with less and less resources, more and more strains -- because it’s hard being poor. People don’t like being poor. It’s time-consuming’ it’s stressful. It’s hard. And so over time, families frayed. Men who could not get jobs left. Mothers who are single are not able to read as much to their kids. So all that was happening 40 years ago to African Americans. And now what we’re seeing is that those same trends have accelerated and they’re spreading to the broader community.\nBut the pattern that, Bob, you’re recording in some of your stories is no different than what William Julius Wilson was talking about when he talked about the truly disadvantaged. So I say all this -- and I know that was not an answer to your question. (Laughter.) I will be willing to answer it, but I think it is important for us at the outset to acknowledge if, in fact, we are going to find common ground, then we also have to acknowledge that there are certain investments we are willing to make as a society, as a whole, in public schools and public universities; in, today, I believe early childhood education; in making sure that economic opportunity is available in communities that are isolated, and that somebody can get a job, and that there’s actually a train that takes folks to where the jobs are -- that broadband lines are in rural communities and not just in cities. And those things are not going to happen through market forces alone.\nAnd if that’s the case, then our government and our budgets have to reflect our willingness to make those investments. If we don’t make those investments, then we could agree on the earned income tax credit -- which I know Arthur believes in. We could agree on home visitation for low-income parents. All those things will make a difference, but the broader trends in our society will make it harder and harder for us to deal with both inequality and poverty.\nAnd so I think it’s important for us to recognize there is a genuine debate here, and that is what portion of our collective wealth and budget are we willing to invest in those things that allow a poor kid, whether in a rural town, or in Appalachia, or in the inner city, to access what they need both in terms of mentors and social networks, as well as decent books and computers and so forth, in order for them to succeed along the terms that Arthur\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the documents provided, there are strong arguments both for and against compulsory education:\n\nFor compulsory education:\n- Ensures that all children have access to basic education, reducing disparities in educational attainment.\n- Helps prevent illiteracy and child labor.\n- Instills discipline and structure, preparing children for adult life.\n- Encourages public interest and traditions in education.\n\nAgainst compulsory education:\n- May infringe on individual liberty and personal choice.\n- Could result in lost earnings for students who need to work to support their families.\n- May not be suitable for all students, potentially leading to frustration and wasted potential.\n- Does not guarantee improved educational outcomes or reduced inequality.\n\nThe debate highlights the complexity of the issue and the importance of considering the unique circumstances and needs of each student.\n</think>\n\n<answer> No, schools and compulsory education should not be made non-compulsory.

    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, the 2020 US presidential election results showed a clear trend towards Biden. Trump won Florida by a narrow margin in 2016, which was crucial for his victory. If Obama were running again, he would likely benefit from similar advantages that he had in 2008 and 2012, such as strong support from key demographic groups like young voters, minorities, and college-educated individuals. Additionally, Obama's previous experience and established political base would give him an advantage. However, the outcome would depend heavily on the state-by-state dynamics and the level of engagement and turnout from his supporters. Given the current political climate and the results of the 2020 election, it seems plausible that Obama could have beaten Trump if he were running again.\n\n<answer> Yes, it seems plausible that Obama could have beaten Trump if he were running again. </answer>",

They’re what I would call the “gravy” category. If a combination of these states votes contrary to its recent history, we’re looking at either a lopsided Biden win or, if Trump wins, the greatest election comeback since Harry S. Truman beat Thomas Dewey in 1948. Each of these states allows the count of absentee and mail-in ballots to start before Election Day.) As for the 36 states not in this election’s battleground category, there should not be much suspense aside from the speed with which their ballots are counted. There could be a shocking outcome in one or two of these states but it appears unlikely at this point. If the electoral votes of the 36 non-battleground states (and the District of Columbia, which has three electoral votes) are allocated based on current polls, Trump has 130 votes locked up and Biden has 202. A total of 270 electoral votes are needed for victory.\nWhat’s the likelihood that 2020 will repeat 2016, when the national popular vote winner lost the presidency due to the Electoral College? If the most recent national polls are accurate, the odds are relatively high that Trump will be a one-term president. The larger the national popular vote margin, the less likely that the weaker candidate will have a path to an electoral vote victory.\nThomas E.

The outcome of today’s election is in the hands of those voters lucky enough to live in a battleground state.) But even these voters are not equal. A few of the battleground states are crucial, others less so. So which battleground states are which? And when, due to the unprecedented level of mail-in balloting, can we expect to know their outcomes?\nAt the top of the list are Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Florida alone could be the tip-off to the identity of the next president. It’s been on the winning side in 13 of the last 14 presidential elections, losing out only in the 1992 Bill Clinton-George H. W. Bush race. President Donald Trump won Florida by a mere 1 percentage point in 2016. Given that he’s behind by a larger margin in national polls this time, Trump likely has to win Florida again to have a chance of victory. Florida’s outcome could be known tonight or by early tomorrow morning. Unlike some states, Florida allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start before Election Day, and such ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted.\nWisconsin is another battleground state that’s more equal than others. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden were to carry Wisconsin, which Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016, he likely will carry the neighboring battleground states of Michigan and Minnesota. They split in 2016, with Hillary Clinton winning narrowly in Minnesota, Trump narrowly in Michigan. But, compared with Wisconsin’s voters, the voters in these two states lean more Democratic. Wisconsin is probably a must-win for Trump, but we might not know its outcome until late next week. Because of a Supreme Court ruling last week, only mail-in ballots received by Election Day will be counted in Wisconsin. Yet, its counting can’t start until Election Day and the state is not equipped to quickly tabulate large numbers of mail-in votes.\nPennsylvania has been a toss-up state in nearly every presidential election since 1976. Trump won by fewer than 50,000 votes in 2016 — this in a state where more than 6 million ballots were cast. Pennsylvania is nearly a must-win state for Biden and he’s in a stronger position there than Clinton was in 2016. Like Wisconsin, it might be late next week before we know the outcome in Pennsylvania. It has a high rate of mail-in balloting, and the count of these ballots can’t begin until Election Day. If the race in Pennsylvania is tight, a legal fight is certain. The Supreme Court declined to make a final decision on a ruling of Pennsylvania’s high court that the state could count ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 and received three days later. The late arriving ballots, for the moment, will be counted separately.\nArizona and North Carolina are in my next tier of important battleground states. Arizona is a new entry into the key battleground-state category. Once safely Republican, it has been trending Democratic due to its increasing Latino population. Unless it’s very close, Arizona’s outcome should be known early. Its mail-in votes can be counted as they arrive. If Trump were to lose Arizona, he likely would have to outperform expectations in the Rust Belt to pull off an Electoral College victory.\nFor its part, North Carolina is another state that Trump likely needs to win. It has gone Republican in four of the last five elections — the exception was 2008, when Barack Obama narrowly edged John McCain. Like Florida, North Carolina could provide an early indicator of the next president.

They’re what I would call the “gravy” category. If a combination of these states votes contrary to its recent history, we’re looking at either a lopsided Biden win or, if Trump wins, t\nDoc 3(Title: Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand voters’ views on the 2024 presidential election, as well how the public views President Joe Biden. For this analysis, we surveyed 8,709 adults – including 7,166 registered voters – from April 8 to April 14, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.) Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, American voters face a similar set of choices as they did four years ago – and many are not happy about it.\nWith the election still more than six months away, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that the presidential race is virtually tied: 49% of registered voters favor Donald Trump or lean toward voting for him, while 48% support or lean toward Joe Biden.\nA defining characteristic of the contest is that voters overall have little confidence in either candidate across a range of key traits, including fitness for office, personal ethics and respect for democratic values.\nWhere Trump has the advantage: More than a third of voters say they are extremely or very confident that Trump has the physical fitness (36%) and mental fitness (38%) needed to do the job of president.\nFar fewer say the same of Biden (15% are at least very confident in his physical fitness; 21% are extremely or very confident in his mental fitness). Majorities say they are not too or not at all confident in Biden’s physical and mental fitness.\nWhere Biden has the advantage: More voters are extremely or very confident in Biden (34%) than in Trump (26%) to act ethically in office. And while 38% say they are at least very confident in Biden to respect the country’s democratic values, fewer (34%) express that level of confidence in Trump. The survey was conducted before the start of Trump’s “hush money” trial in New York City.\n(Read more about voters’ views of Biden and Trump in Chapter 2.)\nThe state of the 2024 presidential race\nThe new Center survey of 8,709 adults – including 7,166 registered voters – conducted April 8-14, 2024, finds large divides in voters’ candidate preference by age, education, and race and ethnicity. As was the case in 2020, younger voters and those with a four-year college degree are more likely to favor Biden than Trump.\nOlder voters and those with no college degree favor Trump by large margins.\nAmong racial and ethnic groups:\n- White voters favor Trump (56%) over Biden (42%) by a wide margin.\n- Roughly three-quarters of Black voters (77%) support Biden, while 18% back Trump.\n- Hispanic voters are more evenly divided – 52% favor Biden, while 44% back Trump.\n- Asian voters favor Biden (59%) over Trump (36%).\n(Read more about voters’ candidate preferences in Chapter 1.)\nMost voters who turned out in 2020 favor the same candidate in 2024. Among validated 2020 voters, overwhelming majorities of those who cast ballots for Biden (91%) and Trump (94%) support the same candidate this year. Registered voters who did not vote in 2020 are about evenly divided: 48% back Trump, while 46% support Biden.\nA majority of voters say “it really matters who wins” the 2024 race. Today, 69% of voters say it really matters which candidate wins the presidential contest this November. This is somewhat smaller than the share who said this in April 2020 about that year’s election (74%). Nearly identical shares of Biden’s and Trump’s supporters say the outcome of the presidential race really matters.\nAbout half of voters would replace both Biden and Trump on the 2024 ballot\nReflecting their dissatisfaction with the Biden-Trump\nDoc 4(Title: accurate election outcome (the Biden 4.4-point margin among voters), and a 10-point Democratic Party affiliation nonvoter advantage to go with the larger (and inaccurate) 12-point Biden margin among voters.2 These adjustments, in effect, simulate different samples of the public. In addition to the weighting to generate the candidate preference and party affiliation scenarios, the surveys are weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, education and many other characteristics.3 This kind of weighting, which is common practice among polling organizations, helps ensure that the sample matches the population on characteristics that may be related to the opinions people hold.) The simulation takes advantage of the fact that our principal source of data on public opinion is the American Trends Panel, a set of more than 10,000 randomly selected U.S. adults who have agreed to take regular online surveys from us. We conducted surveys with these same individuals approximately twice per month in 2020, with questions ranging across politics, religion, news consumption, economic circumstances, technology use, lifestyles and many more topics. For this analysis, we chose a set of 48 survey questions representing a wide range of important topics on nine different surveys conducted during 2020.\nAfter the November election, we asked our panelists if they voted, and if so, for whom. We also collect a measure of party affiliation for all panelists, regardless of their voter status. With this information, we can manipulate the share of Biden vs. Trump voters in each poll, and Democrats vs. Republicans among nonvoters, and look back at their responses to surveys earlier in the year to gauge how our reading of public opinion on issues differs in the two versions.\nBefore describing the results in more detail, it’s important to be explicit about the assumptions underlying this exercise. We can manipulate the share of voters for each presidential candidate and the share of Democrats and Republicans among nonvoters, but the results may not tell the full story if the Trump and Biden voters in our surveys do not accurately represent their voters in the population. For example, if believers of the internet conspiracy theories known as QAnon are a much higher share of Trump voters in the population than in our panel, that could affect how well our simulation reflects the impact of changing the number of Trump voters. The same is true for our adjustments of the relative shares of Democrats and Republicans. If the partisans in our panel do not accurately reflect the partisans in the general public, we may not capture the full impact of over- or underrepresenting one party or the other.\nHow much can the balance of these two scenarios affect measures of opinion on issues?\nThe adjustment from the tilted version (a 12-point Biden advantage with a 10-point Democratic advantage in party affiliation among nonvoters) to the balanced version (a 4.4-point Biden advantage with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans among nonvoters), makes very little difference in the balance of opinion on issue questions. Across a set of 48 opinion questions and 198 answer categories, most answer categories changed less than 0.5%. The average change associated with the adjustment was less than 1 percentage point, and approximately twice that for the margin between alternative answers (e.g., favor minus oppose). The maximum change observed across the 48 questions was 3 points for a particular answer and 5 points for the margin between alternative answers.\nOne 3-point difference was on presidential job approval, a measure very strongly associated with the vote. In the balanced version, 39 percent approved of Trump’s job performance, while 58 percent disapproved. In the tilted version, 36 percent approved of Trump’s performance and 60 percent disapproved. Two other items also showed a 3-point difference on one of the response options. In the b\nDoc 5(Title: The 2016 U.S. Presidential election marks the fifth time in history (1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000) that a candidate who lost the national popular vote won the Electoral College to become President of the United States. Hillary Clinton won 2.4 million more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016 election, based on the certification tally to date, but Trump won 290 Electoral College votes to Clinton’s 232, to win. The final popular election results must be officially certified by each state before electors will meet in their home states on Dec. 19 and the formal vote of the Electoral College will take place.) Ronald Schurin is an associate professor in residence political science and formerly served in the Education Division at the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, who teaches courses on American political parties, electoral realignment, and Connecticut state and municipal politics. He served as an elector for Connecticut in the Electoral College during the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election. He recently discussed the issues surrounding the Electoral College with UConn Today.\nAfter the George W. Bush win over Al Gore in 2000, there was a lot of discussion about changing the presidential election to a direct popular vote, which would require a constitutional amendment. Were there ever any serious efforts for acting on such a change?\nPrior to 2000, there had been several relatively minor incidents that had generated some discussion. For example, in 1968, there was a Republican elector in North Carolina who voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon; in 1976, a Ford elector voted for Ronald Reagan; and in 1988, a Dukakis elector voted for Lloyd Bensten for president. At the time of the 1968 vote, there was a lot of discussion in Congress when the electoral votes were counted, as to whether to allow that vote. It was allowed, but subsequently Sen. Birch Bayh [Democrat] of Indiana chaired several hearings with discussion of several options: get rid of the Electoral College, have states cast their electoral votes but in proportion to the popular vote, or just forbid the faithless elector that you saw in North Carolina. Nothing came of it.\nIs there a provision in the Electoral College process to prevent someone from voting against the way they were elected to vote by their party?\nConnecticut and several other states have a law on the books that say you must cast your vote for the person to whom you are pledged. That law is of somewhat dubious constitutionality in terms of whether the state can pass a law that deals with the action of a federal official. It’s never been put to the test. Moreover, there are no penalties spelled out in the law. In Connecticut, interestingly, you’re supposed to get $10 when you cast your vote as an elector. I guess you could not get your $10, but beyond that there is no provision.\nWe’ve now seen this situation happen twice in recent years, where the person who received the most popular votes lost because of electoral votes. What is the possibility that this kind of thing can occur on a regular basis?\nThere is a pretty good possibility. The Electoral College biases the system in favor of the Republicans now, because the Democrats tend to win in the larger states. You get electoral votes based on the number of federal representatives – the number of members of the House, plus the number of members of the Senate. The smaller states get that bonus. That helped George W. Bush, and now Donald Trump. The smaller states, who get two bonus votes because of their two senators, are more often Republican. Trump carried 30 states and Hillary carried 20. Trump thus got 20 more electors that way. That’s how Bush won, but it’s not the only way Trump won.\nCurrently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the po\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, the 2020 US presidential election results showed a clear trend towards Biden.

If Obama were running again, he would likely benefit from similar advantages that he had in 2008 and 2012, such as strong support from key demographic groups like young voters, minorities, and college-educated individuals. Additionally, Obama's previous experience and established political base would give him an advantage. However, the outcome would depend heavily on the state-by-state dynamics and the level of engagement and turnout from his supporters.

INTRODUCTION\n“Martial arts’”(MA) is a collective term that encompasses the multitude of combat sports, self‐defense, and hand‐to‐hand combat systems developed and implemented around the world. 1 Studies of MA participation have identified a wide range of benefits to school‐aged children. Physiological improvements include increased oxytocin levels, 2 increased flexibility, muscular fitness, and balance. 3 , 4 Additionally, emerging evidence indicates that MA may facilitate positive change in psychological, 5 cognitive, 6 and academic outcomes. 7 Internationally, education systems recognize the benefits of MA, with countries such as the USA having school wrestling teams and associated scholarships, while Budo (an umbrella term for traditionalist Japanese MA) is a mandatory element of junior high‐school physical education in Japan (Chambers and colleagues).\nDespite evidence of the positive benefits, some researchers warn against increased aggression levels and antisocial behavior among participants (when fighting techniques are the sole focus, rather than a holistic approach. 8 , 9 Furthermore, fighting skills and violence are often glorified and propagated in movies, television shows and other popular culture, 10 creating some unrealistic and/or untrue perceptions of MA as a collective. Thus, the incorporation of MA into school settings remains a challenge, partially due to school administrators' and teachers' safety concerns, and their perceptions of MA, and/or a lack of teacher training to deliver MA in an effective manner which meets curriculum objectives. 11\nWithin Australia, the New South Wales (NSW), Australian Capital Territory (ACT), South Australia (SA), Victoria (VIC) Department(s) of Education each currently provide specific safety guidelines and procedures for the teaching of MA within school contexts (NSW Government). 12 The guidelines suggest that MA is acceptable for implementation in both Primary and Secondary schools (assuming the safety guidelines are followed), but it is unclear whether teachers in these states are aware of these guidelines, and data confirming if and when MA is used in schools does not exist.\nFurthermore, numerous outcomes in both the current Australian Health and Physical Education curriculum, and NSW Personal Development, Health and Physical Education curriculum lend themselves to MA. 13 , 14 For example, traditional MA often incorporate ethical and social education, through methods such as meditation and philosophy, discussion, and consistent etiquette expectations (bowing to each other, showing respect to higher level students and instructors, and respecting equipment) in addition to physical training. 8 A number of outcomes from the afore mentioned syllabi, associated with physical activity, align with the foundations on which MA builds on, such as “adapting movement skills in a variety of contexts.” 13 For example, in grappling and wrestling, one mu\nDoc 3(Title: y had never participated in any form of MA, and only 3.1% (n = 3) indicated that they had consistently participated in MA for 5+ years. When asked if they considered themselves to be physically fit, the majority of participants answered either “somewhat agree” (45.4%; n = 44), or “strongly agree” (23.7%; n = 23).) Table 1.\nNote: Question: Do you consider any of the following a barrier for teaching martial arts in your school.\n1 = strongly disagree (is not a barrier); 2 = disagree; 3 = unsure; 4 = somewhat agree; 5 = strongly agree (is a barrier).\n3.2. Qualified (and practicing) teachers\nSurvey participants were predominantly from public schools, representing 75% of the sample—indicative of the larger proportion of teachers in the government sector, compared to independent and catholic schools—and teachers of Stage 3 (n = 20/36). On average, teaching experience was 3.63 years (SD = 2.27; n = 16), with only three participants stating that they had been working for 6—10 years, or longer than 10 years.\n3.3. School climate\nOf the 28 practicing teachers who completed this section, 60.7% either “somewhat agree[d]” (21.4%; n = 6), or “strongly agree[d]” (39.3%; n = 11) that behavioral issues (e.g., bullying, violence, disrespect, vandalism) [are] an issue in [their] school. From the same 28 teachers, 82% either “somewhat agree[d]” (42.9%; n = 12), or “strongly agree[d]” (39.3%; n = 11) that these behavioral issues impact negatively on learning in the classroom. Additionally, teachers were given a list of potential barriers for teaching martial arts in [their] school and asked to rate each of them on a 5‐point Likert scale as being, or not being a barrier. These barriers were ranked as shown in Table 1.\n3.4. Beliefs and attitudes toward martial arts; perceived benefits of martial arts training; future plans; most beneficial martial arts topics, as perceived by participants\nResults from practicing teachers and preservice teachers indicate a low perception of Government recognition of MA in NSW schools, with mean a participant score of 2.94 out of 5 (N = 88; SD = 0.864) for item Q17.6 (see Table 2). Most participants reported that MA training can provide a wide range of benefits to their students, including improved muscular fitness (Mean = 4.34; N = 86; SD = 0.713), improved aerobic fitness (Mean = 4.22; N = 86; SD = 0.773), and improved mental health (Mean = 4.20; N = 86; SD = 0.733). The vast majority of participants “would support the inclusion of MA into the curriculum” (Mean = 4.26; N = 88; SD = 0.864). Most participants 66% (n = 64) have never participated in any form of MA training, and would not feel comfortable teaching this (Mean = 3.15; N = 89; SD = 1.284).\nTable 2.\nAbbreviations: N, number of responses; SD, standard deviation.\nMany participants, however, indicated they would enjoy teaching the subject matter to their students (Mean = 3.76, N = 86; SD = 1.073), and would be interested in learning how to incorporate martial arts into a classroom setting (Mean = 4.04; N = 85; SD = 0.096), and would be interested in attending professional development/accreditation to learn how to teach basic martial arts techniques to [their] students (Mean = 3.92; N = 85; SD = 1.003).\n3.4.1. Comparison of means—Teachers and preservice teachers\nBeliefs\nAs shown in Table 3, there were only two questions with statistically significant differences between groups. The first being Q17.6: I believe the NSW Department of Education promotes martial arts as an acceptable in‐school sport (p = 0.000). This was the lowest mean score for both groups. Preservice teacher participants rated higher on this question (Teachers = 2.33; Preservice teachers = 3.21), indicating they were more likely to have a higher perception of Government recognition of MA in NSW schools. The second statistically significant difference was seen in Q17.9: If self‐defense, or a martial art (of any kind) was introduced to the curriculum, I would support this. (p = 0.031). Both groups, h\nDoc 4(Title:  both groups. Meditation/mindfulness, movement/parkour type activities (e.g., rolling, jumping, vaulting, falling safely), and learning how to dodge and block attacks were also found in the top five in both groups, but varied slightly in rankings. Both groups ranked learning how to use various traditional weapons (e.g., swords, bo staff, kali sticks) the lowest (Teachers = 2.88; Preservice teachers = 3.10).) 3.4.2. Comparison of means—Sex\nBeliefs\nTable 3 shows a statistically significant difference between male and female participants' beliefs relating to inclusion of MA training in primary school settings. While both males and females had a positive skew toward martial arts (scores≥3.58 out of 5), males rated this question higher (F = 3.59, M = 4.00; p = 0.017). There was a generally high mean score in favor of providing students in both primary (female = 4.04; male = 4.17) and high‐school (female = 4.16; male = 4.33) settings with the opportunity to try MA training. The lowest total mean was found in Q17.6: I believe the NSW Department of Education promotes martial arts as an acceptable in‐school sport, (female = 3.07; male = 2.77). Although both groups scored above 2.5, skewing in the direction of positive belief towards this question, there was a level of uncertainty around whether the NSW Department of Education promotes MA as an acceptable in‐school sport in both groups. Both participant groups indicated that they would strongly to very strongly (scores ≥4.13 out of 5) support the introduction of self‐defense or MA (of any kind) into the curriculum, however, participants were less confident in their ability to teach it themselves (female = 3.05; male = 3.32).\nPerceived benefits of martial arts training\nA statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) was seen in question 18.3: Martial arts training can improve muscular fitness in children and adolescents. Male participants responded more strongly to this question, but both groups responded strongly to this question (scores ≥4.14 out of 5). Although generally statistically nonsignificant, the “male” means for 9 out of 10 of these questions were higher than “female.” All means were skewed in a way that indicates participants believe MA training can provide children and adolescents with physiological and psychological, and social benefits.\nAttitudes toward teaching martial arts\nNo statistically significant differences were seen in this section, however, intergroup difference in Q20.2: I believe children and adolescents in general would enjoy participating in martial arts training approached statistical significance (p = 0.051), with the “male” group again scoring slightly more positively toward this belief. Although still in favor (scores≥3.65 out of 5), all respondents were less positive toward teaching MA to students themselves.\nFuture plans\nThere were no statistically significant differences between groups. A trend was found, with Q22.1, Q22.2, and Q22.3 all rating the highest among “female” and “male” groups. All six questions returned means skewed in favor of MA (mean≥3.21).\nMost beneficial martial arts topics for children and adolescents\nNo statistically significant differences were found in this section. Each gender shared a number of commonalities among the five highest mean scored topics. Q23.6: Teamwork/team building activities among classmates; Q23.7: Wellbeing/ethical discussions at the end of each session, focussing on topics such as respect, integrity, self‐control and so forth; Q23.2: Learning how to dodge and block attacks; Q23.10: Meditation/mindfulness; Q23.1: Movement/Parkour type activities (e.g., rolling, jumping, vaulting, falling safely); and Q23.5: Grappling/wrestling (e.g., how to safely escape if tackled or grabbed) were all shown to be included in the topics with the highest mean scores among each group.

    "question": "Is it ethical for healthcare providers to deny certain treatments or surgeries based on religious beliefs?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the documents provided, there are significant ethical and legal considerations when healthcare providers deny certain treatments or surgeries based on religious beliefs. These considerations include:\n\n1. **Ethical Considerations**: Providers have the right to act according to their religious beliefs, but this must be balanced with the patient's right to receive necessary medical care. Denying treatment can lead to harm and even death, which conflicts with the principle of non-maleficence.\n\n2. **Legal Protections**: Many states and federal laws provide protections for healthcare providers who refuse to perform certain medical procedures on religious or moral grounds. These laws can protect providers from discrimination and liability, but they also come with responsibilities to seek alternatives or referrals when possible.\n\n3. **Patient Safety and Care**: Providers must ensure that patients receive appropriate care, which may involve finding alternative providers or making referrals. Refusing care entirely can lead to legal and ethical dilemmas.\n\n4. **Public Health Concerns**: Denying necessary medical treatments can have broader implications for public health, such as reducing herd immunity and increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.\n\nIn conclusion, while healthcare providers have the right to act according to their religious beliefs, it is generally considered unethical to deny necessary treatments or surgeries solely based on these beliefs.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo address this question, we need to consider several factors including ethical principles, legal frameworks, and the balance between individual rights and societal norms.\n\n1. **Ethical Principles**: Healthcare is often guided by ethical principles such as autonomy (the right of patients to make their own decisions), beneficence (acting in the best interest of the patient), non-maleficence (do no harm), and justice (fairness in distribution of resources).\n\n2. **Legal Frameworks**: In many countries, there are laws that protect both patients' rights and healthcare providers' rights, especially concerning religious practices. These laws aim to strike a balance between these rights.\n\n3. **Balancing Rights**: The challenge lies in balancing the provider's right to act according to their religious beliefs with the patient's right to receive necessary treatment. This requires a nuanced approach where possible accommodations are sought while ensuring patient safety and care.\n\n4. **Professional Standards**: Professional bodies in healthcare often have guidelines that address such issues, aiming to ensure that patients receive appropriate care while respecting the providers' rights.\n</think>\n\n<search> ethical considerations in healthcare based on religious beliefs </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Abstract) A substantial minority of Americans have religious beliefs against one or more medical treatments. Some groups promote exclusive reliance on prayer and ritual for healing nearly all diseases. Jehovah’s Witnesses oppose blood transfusions. Hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren have religious or conscientious exemptions from immunizations. Such exemptions have led to personal medical risk, decreases in herd immunity, and outbreaks of preventable disease. Though First Amendment protections for religious freedom do not include a right to neglect a child, many states have enacted laws allowing religious objectors to withhold preventive, screening, and, in some states, therapeutic medical care from children. Religious exemptions from child health and safety laws should be repealed so that children have equal rights to medical care.\nKeywords: Faith-based medical neglect, Public policy, Religious beliefs\nReligion and science are arguably two of the most powerful drivers in human existence. Many consider them different types of truth and both valid while others try to combine them or reject one for the other. Faith-based rejection of medical care has cost the lives of many children and poses challenges to providers.\nAsser and Swan (1998) reviewed deaths of 172 U.S. children after medical care was withheld on religious grounds from 1975 to 1995. Many of the children died of readily treatable infectious diseases and diabetes. The authors found that 80% of the children would have had at least a 90% likelihood of survival with timely medical care.\nMany types of child abuse and maltreatment have been justified by some on religious grounds—for example, severe corporal punishment, exorcism, forced labor, forced marriage, dangerous diets, conversion therapy, and sexual abuse. Yet only faith-based medical neglect is protected in statute. Preventive and screening measures from which many state laws provide religious exemptions include immunizations, metabolic testing, blood lead-level tests, newborn hearing tests, prophylactic eye drops, vitamin K injections or drops, vision examinations, dental examinations, and school instruction about disease (Children’s Healthcare Is a Legal Duty, hereafter cited in text as CHILD (2020a), Religious exemptions from health care). Oregon and Pennsylvania have religious exemptions from bicycle helmets for children (Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes §75–3510(b)(3); Oregon Revised Statutes 814.487).\nThis article discusses public policy and case law on faith-based medical neglect, beliefs against medical care in several denominations, and advice for providers who encounter religious objectors.\nScope of Statutory Exemptions\nReligious exemptions about medical care of sick and injured children vary widely in meaning. Some are likely innocuous while others allow preventable deaths. Several states have a religious exemption in their reporting laws or in statutory definitions of child abuse and neglect (e.g. Calif. Penal Code §11,165.2(b) and Rev. Code of Washington 26.44.020(18)). Such placement sends a message to the would-be reporter that withholding medical care on religious grounds is not child neglect and therefore should not be reported to state child protection services.\nThirty states have religious defenses in their criminal codes. Nine have religious defenses to negligent homicide, manslaughter, or capital murder. West Virginia’s statute defining the crime of murder of a child does “not apply to any parent.. . who fails or refuses.. . to supply a child.. . with necessary medical care” on religious grounds” (WV Code 61.8D-2(d)). Arkansas has a religious defense to capital murder for those who cause deaths of children “under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life” (Ark. Code 5–10-101(a)(9)(B)). There could be identical facts on what two Arkansas parents did to a child and one parent could be sentenced to death while the other would not be charged with murder – based upon their di\nDoc 2(Title: 's right of conscience by declining to participate in or pay for a particular health care service.)

    "agent_answer": "Based on the information gathered, there is strong scientific evidence supporting the occurrence of global warming. Here are key points:\n\n1. **Scientific Consensus**: There is nearly 100% agreement among scientists that global warming is real and caused by human activities, specifically the emission of greenhouse gases.\n\n2. **Historical Data**: Historical data from weather stations and satellite observations show a consistent increase in global temperatures over the past century.\n\n3. **Satellite Observations**: Satellites provide accurate measurements of the temperature of the oceans, land, and atmosphere, confirming the warming trend.\n\n4. **Solar Influence**: Scientific research indicates that solar output does not significantly contribute to the warming observed in recent decades. The vertical pattern of temperature changes also supports this, as it shows warming at the lower layers of the atmosphere and cooling at the upper layers, which is consistent with the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases.\n\nGiven these points, the scientific community has robust evidence to support the occurrence and cause of global warming. Therefore,\n\n<answer>Yes, there is scientific proof for global warming.</answer>",

This involves looking at evidence from climate studies, temperature records, and other relevant data.\n</think>\n\n<search> scientific proof of global warming </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: It’s hard to believe, but apparently more than a few climate change deniers still roam our ever-heating planet. According to a recent study in the esteemed science journal PLOS, people systematically understate their disbelief in human-caused climate change when answering surveys, so skepticism is more prevalent than many of us realize.) Given the urgency of the climate crisis, it’s crucial that we all do our part to educate any doubters we might encounter. That’s why the Rainforest Alliance has compiled six arguments commonly made by climate change deniers, along with science-backed responses you can deploy to convince them of the truth: that climate change is real, accelerating, and that we need to take bold action ASAP.\n1. Climate change denier claim: “This is the coldest winter we’ve had in years! So much for global warming.”\nThere’s a difference between climate and weather: Weather fluctuates day in, day out, whereas climate refers to long term trends—and the overall trend is clearly and indisputably a warming one. While the impacts of climate change have only just begun to hit the Global North, farmers in the tropics have been contending with impacts—from droughts to floods to a proliferation of crop-destroying pests—for years. That’s why the Rainforest Alliance works with farmers to take a climate-smart approach. That means first assessing a farm’s particular climate risks, taking the crop and local ecosystem into account, then finding the right combination of tools to manage the farms climate challenges. That’s what makes climate-smart agriculture “smart.”\nTogether, we’re building a future where people and nature thrive. Sign up today and join our movement.\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n2. “Climate change is natural and normal—it’s happened at other points in history.”\nIt’s true that there have been periods of global warming and cooling—also related to spikes and lulls in greenhouse gases—during the Earth’s long history. But those historic increases in CO2 should be a warning to us: They led to serious environmental disruptions, including mass extinctions. Today, humans are emitting greenhouse gases at a far higher rate than any previous increase in history. (Before you collapse into a puddle of despair, however, find out about our work to promote natural climate solutions, like community forestry and regenerative agriculture.)\n3. “There’s no consensus among scientists that climate change is real.”\nWrong. There is nearly 100 percent agreement among scientists. Moreover, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that global warming is accelerating, and will reach 1.C above pre-Industrial levels around 2030—a full decade earlier than previously forecast.\n4. “Plants and animals can adapt.”\nWrong again. Because human-caused climate change is happening so rapidly, species simply don’t have time to adapt. Frogs tell the story best: With their semi-permeable skin, unprotected eggs, and reliance on external temperatures to regulate their own, they are often among the first species to die off when ecosystems tip out of balance—and they’re dying off in droves. The Rainforest Alliance chose a frog as its mascot more than 30 years ago precisely because it’s a bio-indicator: A healthy frog population signals a healthy ecosystem, which is what we’ve been working to promote—along with thriving communities—since 1987.\n5. “Climate change is good for us.”\nIt’s hard to even know where to begin to address this statement by climate change deniers, especially when you think about the human cost of a warming planet. The evidence points to a clear link between climate change and a surge in modern slavery: When crop failures, drought, floods, or fires wipe out livelihoods and homes, people migrate in the hopes of improving their lot—but can find themselves vulnerable to human trafficking and forced labor and other human rights abuses. And the overall economic cost is staggering: The global economy could lose $23 trillion to\nDoc 2(Title: imate change\" is the more scientifically accurate term.

You’re more likely to picture astronauts floating around the International Space Station, or engineers designing rovers that can traverse volcanoes on Mars.) However, Earth is a planet too, and we can learn a great deal about our climate from the vantage point of space.\nTogether organisations like NASA and the European Space Agency have over 150 satellites in orbit around the planet. They are watching the oceans, land, ice, atmosphere and biosphere.\nHow do we know that the Earth is warming?\nIn 2015, 196 countries around the world signed up to the Paris Agreement (United Nations Climate Change). This ground-breaking legislation legally forces governments to curb their carbon emissions to limit global warming to less than 2°C.\nThis event was only possible because scientists had unequivocal proof that global temperatures have risen at unprecedented rates over the last century.\nBut how do scientists know that the Earth is warming?\nSatellites collecting data\nToday, hundreds of miles above the Earth’s surface, a vast network of satellites is collecting data on our planet’s climate system. These satellites provide accurate measurements of the temperature of our oceans, land and atmosphere.\nHowever, that wasn’t always the case. The first person to provide proof that the planet was heating up was actually a little-known amateur scientist called Guy Callendar.\nIn 1938, Callendar painstakingly collected records from 147 weather stations across the world. He discovered that global temperatures had risen 0.3°C over the previous 50 years.\nHowever, at the time his findings were largely ignored by:\n- governments\n- industries\n- even other scientists.\nIt wasn’t until the advent of satellites that Callendar’s measurements could be confirmed, and the world started to take notice.\nA new age of satellite observations\nThe first satellite to provide an accurate measurement of Earth’s atmospheric temperatures was NASA’s Nimbus III, which was launched in 1969.\nToday’s satellites are capable of much more sophisticated measurements. In Britain, huge advances in measuring global surface temperatures have been made by scientists at RAL Space. RAL Space is based at the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s (STFC) Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Didcot in Oxfordshire.\nMeasuring sea and land surface temperatures\nSince the 1980s, scientists at RAL Space have helped develop and calibrate a series of instruments that can measure sea and land surface temperatures to unprecedented accuracy.\nThis began with the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series. These were fitted on board the European Space Agency’s satellites:\n- ERS-1\n- ERS-2\n- Envisat.\nAfter the Envisat satellite retired in 2012, RAL Space developed the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) (STFC) for the sentinel satellites.\nThe satellites form part of the EU’s Copernicus Earth observation programme, which is providing us with an unprecedented picture of how Earth’s climate is changing.\nThere are two SLSTR instruments in orbit currently, and together they are able to cover almost all the globe in a day.\nThe importance of calibration\nA lot of work goes into designing, building, testing and calibrating a satellite instrument.\nDr Hugh Mortimer, a research scientist at STFC’s RAL Space explains why calibration, in particular, is important.\nIt’s vital that we can trust satellites and know that the data they provide us with is the truth.\nCalibration isn’t particularly sexy, but it is so important.\nIt underpins climate science and our trust in the data that is produced by NASA and the European Space Agency.\nYou cannot tweak or tune in space\nUnlike a car, which can be serviced in a garage, once the instrument is strapped to a rocket and launched into space you cannot tweak it or tune it.

It's not surprising that people think first of the most obvious part of our solar system, the Sun, when thinking about factors that warm Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is, after all, the provider of virtually all the energy in Earth's climate.\nNot surprising, but also not correct. Not correct, that is, when it comes to understanding the observed global temperature increases over roughly the past six decades. Over the past four decades, total solar irradiance has shown no particular trend. Given the Sun's slight cooling trend and the overall warming atmosphere, the Sun and the planet's climate actually have been moving in opposite directions.\nIt's a case where the scientific evidence refutes the easy or “knee-jerk” first-impulse, and in that respect it's not so unusual.\nLong-term solar output from the Sun, after all, strongly influences Earth's temperature and climate, but it cannot explain the increased warming during the Industrial Age. The National Research Council has reported that indirect estimates of solar output measured by sun spot activity in fact showed a slight increase during the first few decades of the 20th century, and those increases indeed may have contributed to warming during that period. But with satellite measurements available since 1979 having replaced less-precise sun spot observations, it is clear that solar output cannot be the major contributor to higher temperatures since the 1950s.\nAn extensive body of scientific research and evidence counters claims published in 1991 suggesting “strikingly good agreement” between solar cycle lengths and land surface temperatures between 1860 and 1990. That lone scientific study has given rise to much of the mistaken “It's the Sun” premise. Using various statistical and physical approaches, scientific researchers have shown relatively small solar contributions to global warming over the past half-century-plus, and supporting data from satellites and weather balloons have withstood vigorous scientific scrutiny in rejecting the notion that the Sun's output is responsible for warming during the latter part of the 20th century.\nOn the contrary, solar output calculations based on satellite data and sun spot activity and a range of independent measures of solar activity actually show a “slight cooling influence” in recent decades. Researchers Grant Foster and Stefan Rahmstorf, for instance, reported in 2011 that between 1979 and 2010 solar activity had a cooling effect of between -0.014 and -0.023Â°C. Researchers Judith Lean and David Rind earlier had found that solar activity can account for about 11 percent of global warming between 1889 and 2006, but only for about 1.6 percent of the warming between 1955 and 2005, with a slight cooling effect â about -0.004 degreesÂ°C â from 1979 to 2005.\nA Telltale Sign: Differences in Atmospheric Layers\nOne telltale sign the scientific community points to in concluding that solar radiation is not a major factor in recent warming involves differences between the troposphere, the lower layer of the atmosphere, and the stratosphere, the upper layer. The physics of increased solar output holds that there would be a uniform warming at all layers of the atmosphere as a result of increased solar radiation. But just the opposite has occurred: warming at the lower level and cooling at the upper layer.\n“This is exactly the vertical pattern of temperature changes expected from increased greenhouse gases, which traps energy closer to the Earth's surface,” according to the National Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences. “If an increase in solar output were responsible for the recent warming trend, the vertical pattern of warming would be more uniform through the layers of the atmosphere.”\nBut without tha\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information gathered, there is strong scientific evidence supporting the occurrence of global warming. Here are key points:\n\n1. **Scientific Consensus**: There is nearly 100% agreement among scientists that global warming is real and caused by human activities, specifically the emission of greenhouse gases.\n\n2. **Historical Data**: Historical data from weather stations and satellite observations show a consistent increase in global temperatures over the past century.\n\n3. **Satellite Observations**: Satellites provide accurate measurements of the temperature of the oceans, land, and atmosphere, confirming the warming trend.\n\n4. **Solar Influence**: Scientific research indicates that solar output does not significantly contribute to the warming observed in recent decades. The vertical pattern of temperature changes also supports this, as it shows warming at the lower layers of the atmosphere and cooling at the upper layers, which is consistent with the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases.\n\nGiven these points, the scientific community has robust evidence to support the occurrence and cause of global warming.

Third, parental rights are limited by the interests of \nthe children, and while Roe establishes a right to end the life of a \nchild conceived but not yet born, it says nothing about ending the life \nof children living out of the womb.\n    It may be said that American law establishes a privacy interest in \ncoital reproduction. But even this has been limited to marriage. The \nprecedents leading to Roe fairly establish this. Harlan&#x27;s specific \nemphasis in Poe v. Ullman was that the state statute in question \ncriminalized marital use of contraception.\\\\47\\\\ While there may be a \nright to the use of contraceptives, even by minors, there is still no \nestablished liberty in premarital or extramarital sexual relations.\\\\48\\\\\n    Hence, nothing in Supreme Court case law jumps the gap between \ncoital and non-coital reproduction--to say nothing of the gap from \nsexual to asexual reproduction--and the reliance of the cases involving \ncoital reproduction on physical integrity cannot be extended to the \nextracorporeal use of germ cells to achieve in vitro fertilization. \nFinally, it is apparent in Robertson&#x27;s construction of his procreative \nliberty that the essence of this parental right is the exertion of \nparental will and desire, a notion of ownership, the imposition of \npersonal will, a conditional love or care. It is exactly this notion \nthat characterized the complete autonomy of the Roman father and was \nrepudiated by the common law.\n        b. the limits of roe&#x27;s right to \\`\\`terminate pregnancy&#x27;&#x27;\n    Roe v.

McRae, \\`\\`the Court in Wade emphasized the fact that the \nwoman&#x27;s decision carries with it significant personal health \nimplications--both physical and psychological.&#x27;&#x27; \\\\52\\\\ Roe created a \nnegative right to terminate a pregnancy without social (governmental) \nlimits; it did not establish a positive liberty to procreation or a \npositive liberty in non-coital reproduction. Roe created a right to \navoid procreation, not a right to procreate. This characterization was \nreaffirmed in Carey v. Populations Services International,\\\\53\\\\ and \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey.\\\\54\\\\ The central discussion of \n\\`\\`terminating pregnancy&#x27;&#x27; in Casey is concluded by a reference to \n\\`\\`these considerations of the nature of the abortion right. . . .&#x27;&#x27; \n\\\\55\\\\ Likewise, when the Court in Eisenstadt v. Baird refers to \\`\\`the \ndecision whether to bear or beget a child,&#x27;&#x27; \\\\56\\\\ it was understood to \nrefer to the literal physical burden of pregnancy.\\\\57\\\\ \\`\\`Terminating \npregnancy&#x27;&#x27; is the concept of the Roe liberty held by Justice Blackmun \nhimself.\\\\58\\\\\n    The limits of Roe are seen as well in the abortion-funding cases. \nIn Maher v. Roe,\\\\59\\\\ the Court held that \\`\\`the right protects the woman \nfrom unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether \nto terminate her pregnancy\\\\60\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; In Harris v. McRae,\\\\61\\\\ the Supreme \nCourt referred, more than once, to the Roe liberty as \\`\\`the freedom of \na woman to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy.\\\\62\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; The funding \ncases demonstrate that the states may \\`\\`make a value judgment favoring \nchildbirth over abortion&#x27;&#x27; and \\`\\`implement that judgment&#x27;&#x27; by the use \nof public funding.\n    The Roe abortion liberty as the basis for an unlimited right to \n\\`\\`procreative liberty&#x27;&#x27; is also severely limited by the fact that it \nexpressly and \nDoc 5(Title: S.Hrg. 107-1050 — HUMAN CLONING) \ne \ncommon phrase, being \\`\\`with child.\\\\106\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Early texts on midwifery, \nmedicine, and jurisprudence used the term \\`\\`child&#x27;&#x27; at any time of \npregnancy.\\\\107\\\\\n    Though limited by contemporary medicine, American law incorporated \na general rule of protection. Thus, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial \nCourt stated, \\`\\`\\[t\\]o many purposes, in reference to civil rights, an \ninfant in ventre sa mere is regarded as a person in being.\\\\108\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Or, \nas the New Jersey Supreme Court stated as long ago as 1849 in State v. \nCooper, \\`\\`\\[i\\]t is true, for certain civil purposes, the law regards an \ninfant as in being from the time of conception. . . . \\\\109\\\\ &#x27;&#x27;\n    The centuries during which legal protection was burdened by the \nlimitations of medical knowledge dwarf the relatively few, recent years \nwhen heightened medical knowledge has allowed treatment and surgery in \nutero. The novelty of medical technology that allows treatment and \nvisualization of the unborn human being was highlighted by the famous \nSwedish photographer, Lennart Nilsson. \\`\\`New technology has made it \npossible to see the actual events surrounding fertilization and to \nvisualize the growing fetus more clearly.\\\\110\\\\ &#x27;&#x27;\n                  b. quickening as an evidentiary line\n    With the limitations of medical knowledge, quickening was \nestablished centuries ago as the most reliable medical line showing \nevidence of life. From the fourteenth through the nineteenth centuries, \nquickening was the only reliable evidence that a woman was pregnant or \nthat the unborn human being was alive. As late as 1800, a standard text \non midwifery (the forerunner to obstetrics) concluded that \\`\\`there \nappears to be no unequivocal sign, whereby that state \\[pregnancy\\] can \nwith certainty be determined, till between the fourth and fifth \nmonths,when the child quickens, that is, when its motions are \ndistinctly felt.\\\\111\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Texts of midwifery typically contained \nchapters on the \\`\\`signs of pregnancy,&#x27;&#x27; in which quickening was \nemphasized.\\\\112\\\\ Thomas Denman, a widely cited authority on the \nsubject, expressed the developing understanding of quickening in his \n1829 text:\n\n          The changes which follow quickening have been attributed to \n        various causes. By some it has been conjectured, that the child \n        then acquired a new mode of existence; or that it was arrived \n        to such a size as to be able to dispense with the menstrous \n        blood, before retained in the constitution of the parent, which \n        it disturbed by its quantity or malignity. But it is not now \n        suspected, that there is any difference between the aboriginal \n        life of the child, and that which it possesses at any period of \n        pregnancy, though there may be an alteration in the proofs of \n        its existence, by the enlargement of its size, and the \n        acquisition of greater strength.\\\\113\\\\\n\nBeck, in his Elements of Medical Jurisprudence--one of the primary \nauthorities in the 19th century--emphasized the same understanding:\n\n          It is important to understand the sense attached to this word \n        \\[quickening\\] formerly, and at the present day. The ancient \n        opinion, on which indeed the laws of some countries have been \n        founded, was, that the foetus became animated at this period--\n        that it acquired a new mode of existence. This is altogether \n        abandoned.

    "question": "Should Hillary Clinton be responsible for the leak of emails, which contain governmental information, from her private email server?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, it appears that Hillary Clinton was responsible for using a private email server to manage government communications while she was Secretary of State. This action was against established regulations and guidelines for handling official government records and communications. However, the exact extent of her responsibility and whether she intentionally mishandled classified information remains a subject of investigation and debate. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted an investigation into whether classified documents were mishandled in relation to her private email server. Therefore, while there is evidence suggesting she was responsible for the use of a private server, the full extent of her responsibility and any criminal liability would depend on the findings of the investigation and the interpretation of the applicable laws and regulations.",

If you would like to help our coverage grow, consider donating to Ballotpedia.\nWhile serving as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Hillary Clinton said she exclusively used a private email account to send both personal messages and communications related to official State Department business.[1][2] By managing her email in this manner, Clinton potentially violated record-keeping, transparency, and security regulations.[3][4][5]\nThere were three lines of inquiry into Clinton's emails:\n- Several journalists and watchdog groups filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for Clinton's records, including her emails. The resulting federal court cases led to greater scrutiny of Clinton's private email server usage.[6]\n- The House Select Committee on Benghazi, which investigated how the State Department handled the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, requested information about the management of Clinton's private email server and communications related to Benghazi.[7]\n- In August 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation to determine whether classified documents were mishandled in relation to Clinton's private email server.[8]\nRegulations governing electronic document storage\nProtocol for the retention and security of official government documents is governed by several regulations: the Federal Records Act, guidelines issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Section 1924 under Title 18 of the United States Code.[14] Some of these rules were changed to more directly address electronic records after Clinton left her position as secretary of state in 2013.\nRegulations in place during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state\n- The Federal Records Act contains the following guidelines for record management:\n- The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) also offers guidance on record retention. In 1995, its regulations stipulated the following:\n- The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was created to \"foster democracy by ensuring public access to agency records and information.\"[19] Anyone can make a FOIA request for official government documents. If the information requested falls under one of nine exemption categories, it is not required to be disclosed. \"Information that is classified to protect national security\" is an example of an exemption category.[20]\n- 18 U.S.C. § 1924 makes it criminal for an employee or contractor of the United States to \"knowingly\" remove classified documents or retain them at \"an unauthorized location.\"[21]\nRegulations established after Clinton's tenure as secretary of state\nIn September 2013, NARA issued new guidance covering email usage. According to NARA, \"agency employees must ensure that all Federal records sent or received on personal email systems are captured and managed in accordance with agency recordkeeping practices.\"[22] The guidance also noted federal employees should not use personal email accounts for official business except where there is an emergency or issue with accessibility.[23]\nIn November 2014, President Barack Obama signed into law the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, which modernized regulations governing electronic document storage. The law updated the Federal Records Act to explicitly include electronic records in the definition of federal records and clarified the duties of federal officials who maintained non-government email systems.[24] One significant change in the law required federal employees who used \"a non-official electronic messaging account\" to copy the employee's official account when sending messages or forward the record no later than 20 days after it was created.[25]\nPotential liability\nClinton's potential criminal liability arose under 18 U.S.C. § 1924, the iss\nDoc 2(Title: eptember 2, 2016) - ↑ 164.0 164.1 FBI, \"Hillary R.

After Hurricane Sandy hit New York in October 2012 and the system crashed, Clinton hired Platte River Networks to manage the server and provide \"better security, durability, and a more professional setup.\"[33]) At some point after Clinton finished her service as secretary of state, the server was transferred to a data center in New Jersey.[34] According to U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) in March 2015, Clinton \"unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server.\"[35] David Kendall, Clinton's attorney, said that Clinton \"chose not to keep her non-record personal emails\" but \"has maintained and preserved copies\" of work-related communications.[35] On August 12, 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reportedly took possession of the email server.[34]\nThe Washington Post reported on September 12, 2015, that personal correspondence from Clinton's server could be recoverable. Platte River Networks, the company that managed the server beginning in 2013, said it had “no knowledge of the server being wiped.”[36] Datto, Inc., a private technology company hired by Platte River to produce backups of Clinton’s email accounts, announced on October 6, 2015, that it would provide the FBI with the data it had preserved from those accounts. Clinton consented to the release.[37]\nOn October 7, 2015, the Associated Press reported that hackers located in China, South Korea and Germany had attempted to infiltrate Hillary Clinton’s private email server in 2013. The cyberattacks were blocked by a “threat monitoring” service. It is not yet known whether the attempted attacks were targeted or a “nuisance” attack directed at servers around the world.[38]\nDiscovery of Clinton's private email server\nNews that Clinton used a private email account while working for the State Department first broke in March 2013 after a hacker, using the handle \"Guccifer,\" allegedly gained access to the email account of Sidney Blumenthal, an advisor to Clinton. Guccifer provided screenshots to media outlets showing Blumenthal sent numerous messages related to national security to hdr22@clintonemail.com, which many media outlets correctly presumed belonged to Clinton.[39][40][41]\nState Department officials contacted Clinton in the summer of 2014 after they discovered they did not have access to many of her emails. State Department spokesman John Kirby said, \"In the process of responding to congressional document requests pertaining to Benghazi, State Department officials recognized that it had access to relatively few email records from former Secretary Clinton. State Department officials contacted her representatives during the summer of 2014 to learn more about her email use and the status of emails in that account.”[42] In October 2014, the State Department requested the work-related emails of Clinton and other former secretaries of state after the State Department noted it also \"did not have extensive email records from prior Secretaries of State.\"[42]\nThe following month, the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested access to Clinton's emails regarding the 2012 attack in Benghazi. Clinton provided 300 emails. An additional set of emails, produced from other officials' email accounts, had been provided to the committee in August 2014 by the State Department.[1] On December 5, 2014, Clinton released 30,490 printed emails to the State Department. Another 31,830 emails were determined to be private and not released.[1]\nNearly three months later, on March 2, 2015, Michael Schmidt of The New York Times reported that Clinton \"exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state...and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be\nDoc 5(Title:  & World Report, \"Read the Second Batch of Hillary Clinton's Released Emails,\" July 1, 2015) - ↑ 53.0 53.1 Politico, \"New Clinton emails show expansive role of Sidney Blumenthal,\" June 30, 2015\n- ↑ CNN, \"Clinton emails: Obama aides knew of private address,\" July 1, 2015\n- ↑ NBC News, \"Third Round of Hillary Clinton Emails Released,\" July 31, 2015\n- ↑ 56.0 56.1 NBC News, \"Third Round of Hillary Clinton Emails Released,\" July 31, 2015\n- ↑ Wall Street Journal, \"Largest Batch to Date of Hillary Clinton Emails Released by State Department,\" September 1, 2015\n- ↑ Reuters, \"Hillary Clinton aides worried about private email use in 2011,\" September 30, 2015\n- ↑ The Hill, \"State Department releases thousands of new Clinton emails,\" September 30, 2015\n- ↑ 60.0 60.1 CBS News, \"Thousands of pages of Hillary Clinton's emails released,\" October 30, 2015\n- ↑ Politico, \"The 13 must-read Clinton emails,\" October 30, 2015\n- ↑ 62.0 62.1 The New York Times, \"White House Aims to Stop Release of Obama-Clinton Emails,\" October 30, 2015\n- ↑ Politico, \"State Dept., intel watchdog tangle over Clinton emails,\" November 30, 2015\n- ↑ Politico, \"The 15 must-read Clinton emails,\" November 30, 2015\n- ↑ NBC News, \"State Department Releases Largest Batch Yet of Clinton Emails,\" November 30, 2015\n- ↑ ABC News, \"State Department Falls Short on New Batch of Clinton Emails,\" December 31, 2015\n- ↑ 67.0 67.1 Politico, \"The 8 must-read Hillary Clinton emails,\" January 8, 2016\n- ↑ 68.0 68.1 The Hill, \"State dumps new batch of Clinton emails late Friday,\" January 29, 2016\n- ↑ 69.0 69.1 The New York Times, \"More Hillary Clinton Emails Released, Including 3 Now ‘Secret,'\" February 13, 2016\n- ↑ Politico, \"More Hillary Clinton emails released on eve of Nevada caucuses,\" February 19, 2016\n- ↑ CBS News, \"Second-to-last batch of Hillary Clinton's emails released,\" February 27, 2016\n- ↑ VICE News, \"Hours Before South Carolina Primary, 1,500 Pages of Hillary Clinton Emails Are Released,\" February 26, 2016\n- ↑ The Washington Post, \"State Department releases final batch of Clinton emails,\" February 29, 2016\n- ↑ NBC News, \"State Department Releases Final Batch of Hillary Clinton's Emails,\" March 1, 2016\n- ↑ Reuters, \"State Department says halts review of Clinton emails at FBI request,\" April 2, 2016\n- ↑ 76.0 76.1 76.2 The New York Times, \"Classified Data Found in Personal Email of Colin Powell and Aides to Condoleezza Rice,\" February 4, 2016\n- ↑ Politico, \"State Dept. watchdog: Clinton violated email rules,\" May 25, 2016\n- ↑ 78.0 78.1 ABC News, \"Hillary Clinton Doubles Down on Email Scandal, Saying 'It Was Allowed,'\" May 26, 2016\n- ↑ Note: This text is quoted verbatim from the original source.\n- ↑ CNN, \"State Department report slams Clinton email use,\" May 25, 2016\n- ↑ Republican National Committee, \"RNC Statement On State Dept.

    "question": "Does the United States allow a communist president?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the documents provided, the U.S. does not allow a communist president because the U.S. political system is fundamentally opposed to communism. The Founding Fathers and early American leaders were wary of concentrated government power, which is a hallmark of communism. They believed in individual freedom and limited government intervention in economic matters. Furthermore, the U.S. Constitution and its amendments, such as the Bill of Rights, protect individual liberties and limit the power of the government, making it difficult for a communist leader to implement their ideology. Additionally, the historical context and rhetoric, such as Norman Thomas' statement about Barry Goldwater, indicate that the U.S. views communism as a threat to individual freedom and democracy.</answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> To answer this question, I need to consider the political system of the United States and its stance on communism. The U.S. is a democratic country with a system that typically does not allow for communist leaders due to its emphasis on individual freedoms and free markets. However, I should verify the specific legal and constitutional aspects.</think>\n\n<search> \"can a communist become president of the united states\" </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: re talking to a Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, \"We don't know how lucky we are.\" And the Cuban stopped and said, \"How lucky you are? I had someplace to escape to.\" And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.) And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man.\nThis is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down - [up] man's old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.\nIn this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the \"Great Society,\" or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say, \"The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism.\" Another voice says, \"The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state.\" Or, \"Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century.\" Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as \"our moral teacher and our leader,\" and he says he is \"hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document.\" He must \"be freed,\" so that he \"can do for us\" what he knows \"is best.\" And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as \"meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government.\"\nWell, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as \"the masses.\" This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, \"the full power of centralized government\"this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.\nNow, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85 percent of the farm surplus.

A recent poll indicated that a substantial percentage of American citizens would be willing to give up some protections of the Bill of Rights in order to control illegal drug use.\nSeveral years ago Congress passed a law authorizing federal authorities to confiscate the property of individuals suspected of trafficking in drugs. Such property could be seized on mere suspicion. Individuals whose property had been seized could appeal and seek a return of their property, but the burden of proof rested on them to prove their innocence.\nAdvocates of this law argued its constitutionality on the grounds that the government was not acting against the suspected individuals, only against their property. Since only individuals, and not property, enjoy the protection of the Bill of Rights, they said, the law did not violate the Constitution.\nSince going into effect the law has proved controversial. Congress may repeal it. Do you think it should be repealed? Even if the constitutionality of such a law is upheld, should the government have such power? How would you determine the circumstances in which protections guaranteed by the Constitution should be curtailed by the government?\n- How do the following statements apply to this situation?

Diversity\nIs a common language essential to the survival of American democracy? One of the most controversial aspects of diversity in America has to do with language. Throughout our history English has been the principal language of the country. For millions of immigrants, learning English was an important first step to becoming a U.S. citizen.\nSchools must teach immigrant children who speak languages other than English. Educators differ about how best to accomplish their tasks. Moreover, a large percentage of recent immigrants use Spanish as their first language. In certain areas of the country Spanish is as commonly spoken as English. We are becoming, many believe, a bilingual nation.\n- How do the following statements apply to this situation? What\nDoc 5(Title: out a warrant? They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.) Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, \"If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States.\" I think that's exactly what he will do.\nBut as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died, because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.\nNow it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the, or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\nOur Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men - that we're to choose just between two personalities.\nWell what of this man that they would destroy, and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him \"when.\" I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.\nThis is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.\nAn ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, \"Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such,\" and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.\nDuring the hecti\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the documents provided, the U.S. does not allow a communist president because the U.S. political system is fundamentally opposed to communism.

    "question": "Why do so many people believe Hillary Clinton should be imprisoned?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, the belief that Hillary Clinton should be imprisoned stems primarily from the email controversy during her tenure as Secretary of State. She used a private email server for both personal and official communications, which potentially violated federal regulations regarding record-keeping, transparency, and security. This led to multiple investigations and legal proceedings, including FOIA requests and a federal investigation by the FBI. While the investigations did not result in criminal charges, the perceived mishandling of sensitive information and the subsequent cover-up efforts have fueled speculation and criticism. Some people may believe that the severity of the situation warrants imprisonment, though no such action was taken due to lack of evidence of criminal intent. </think>\n\n<answer> The belief that Hillary Clinton should be imprisoned is largely based on the email controversy during her time as Secretary of State, where she used a private email server for official communications, which potentially violated federal regulations. </answer>",

Another area could be related to her role in the Clinton Foundation and its dealings with foreign governments, but this is less clear-cut. </think>\n\n<search> Hillary Clinton email controversy </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Hillary Clinton email investigation) Ballotpedia's scope changes periodically, and this article type is no longer actively created or maintained. If you would like to help our coverage grow, consider donating to Ballotpedia.\nWhile serving as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Hillary Clinton said she exclusively used a private email account to send both personal messages and communications related to official State Department business.[1][2] By managing her email in this manner, Clinton potentially violated record-keeping, transparency, and security regulations.[3][4][5]\nThere were three lines of inquiry into Clinton's emails:\n- Several journalists and watchdog groups filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for Clinton's records, including her emails. The resulting federal court cases led to greater scrutiny of Clinton's private email server usage.[6]\n- The House Select Committee on Benghazi, which investigated how the State Department handled the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, requested information about the management of Clinton's private email server and communications related to Benghazi.[7]\n- In August 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation to determine whether classified documents were mishandled in relation to Clinton's private email server.[8]\nRegulations governing electronic document storage\nProtocol for the retention and security of official government documents is governed by several regulations: the Federal Records Act, guidelines issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Section 1924 under Title 18 of the United States Code.[14] Some of these rules were changed to more directly address electronic records after Clinton left her position as secretary of state in 2013.\nRegulations in place during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state\n- The Federal Records Act contains the following guidelines for record management:\n- The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) also offers guidance on record retention. In 1995, its regulations stipulated the following:\n- The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was created to \"foster democracy by ensuring public access to agency records and information.\"[19] Anyone can make a FOIA request for official government documents. If the information requested falls under one of nine exemption categories, it is not required to be disclosed. \"Information that is classified to protect national security\" is an example of an exemption category.[20]\n- 18 U.S.C. § 1924 makes it criminal for an employee or contractor of the United States to \"knowingly\" remove classified documents or retain them at \"an unauthorized location.\"[21]\nRegulations established after Clinton's tenure as secretary of state\nIn September 2013, NARA issued new guidance covering email usage. According to NARA, \"agency employees must ensure that all Federal records sent or received on personal email systems are captured and managed in accordance with agency recordkeeping practices.\"[22] The guidance also noted federal employees should not use personal email accounts for official business except where there is an emergency or issue with accessibility.[23]\nIn November 2014, President Barack Obama signed into law the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, which modernized regulations governing electronic document storage. The law updated the Federal Records Act to explicitly include electronic records in the definition of federal records and clarified the duties of federal officials who maintained non-government email systems.[24] One significant change in the law required federal employees who used \"a non-official electronic messaging account\" to copy the employee's official account when sending messages or forward the record no later than 20 days after it was created.[25]\nPotential liability\nClinton's potential criminal liability arose under 18 U.S.C. § 1924, the iss\nDoc 2(Title:  for Clinton. He said that he was not certain he would be running against Clinton in the general election because of questions over her private email server use.[82]) Bernie Sanders declined to comment on the report. His campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said in an interview, \"Well, I think the report speaks for itself. This is obviously an area where the senator has chosen not to go. He's tried to keep this campaign on the issues.\"[83]\nAs of September 2015, there were approximately 35 federal cases related to FOIA requests for emails sent or received by Clinton while she was secretary of state.[6] One claim by Vice News investigative reporter Jason Leopold predated Clinton's public recognition of her private email server. Leopold sued the State Department in January 2015 arguing it failed to timely respond to his November 4, 2014, FOIA request for \"any and all records that were prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by\" the agency between January 21, 2009, and February 1, 2013, that related to Clinton.[84]\nIn May 2015, the State Department proposed releasing 55,000 pages of Clinton's emails on January 15, 2016, but Judge Rudolph Contreras of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected this plan.[85][86] Instead, on May 27, 2015, Contreras ordered the State Department to produce batches of Clinton's emails every 30 days beginning June 30, 2015.[87]\nAcknowledging the number of pending FOIA-related lawsuits, Contreras encouraged the parties to seek consolidation of the cases in July 2015. He said,\"These are very unusual circumstances, and it would not take a wild imagination to think that there will be some discovery in these FOIA cases, and if six different judges start ordering six different forms of discovery, that's going to be impossible to manage for everybody. So give that some thought.\"[6] Efforts to consolidate these cases were formalized two months later. On September 3, 2015, the State Department requested that schedules for production be managed by one \"coordinating judge,\" bringing “order” to the process.[88][89] Judge Reggie Walton, Contreras' colleague on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, expressed skepticism that the cases could be consolidated. \"Some information I’ve heard indicates there may be a reluctance on the part of judges to go along with that because [some cases] are so far along,\" said Walton.\nIn a report released on January 8, 2016, the Office of the Inspector General found the State Department had given “inaccurate and incomplete” answers to inquiries about Clinton’s records. “We know we must continue to improve our FOIA responsiveness and are taking additional steps to do so,” John Kirby, a spokesman for the State Department, said.[90]\nThe State Department requested a one-month extension to release the final batch of Clinton's emails on January 22, 2016. Lawyers for the agency argued a blizzard in Washington, D.C., had delayed production. The extension request also noted that 7,254 pages of emails that should have been sent to other agencies for review had never been transmitted, further delaying the process.[91]\nA lawyer for Leopold, Ryan James, said in response to the request, \"It's baffling why State needs a month to make up for only three days of snow-related office closures.\"[91] Judge Contreras scheduled a status hearing for February 9, 2016, to discuss the production schedule. [92] At the hearing, Contreras chastised the government for not meeting the original deadline and putting him \"between a rock and a hard place.\" He ordered the agency to produce \"a detailed explanation\" for the delay.[93]\nDepositions and discovery\nOn April 5, 2016, State Department lawyers requested that only \"limited discovery\" be granted in the case brought by Judicial Watch, including narrowing the scope of what could be asked in depositions of Clinton’s staffers. The Daily Beast reported that the “State’s lawyers proposed that the group only be allowed to ask q\nDoc 3(Title: and not released.[1]) Nearly three months later, on March 2, 2015, Michael Schmidt of The New York Times reported that Clinton \"exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state...and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be retained as part of the agency’s record.\"[43]\nClinton's public disclosures\nThe day after Schmidt's story was published in The New York Times, Clinton tweeted, \"I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.\"[1]\nDuring a press conference at the United Nations to discuss women's rights on March 10, 2015, Clinton made her first public address regarding the issue of her private email server. She said, \"I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.\"[44]\nClinton also noted that majority of the emails she sent were delivered to government employees with government addresses. Such messages were captured on the State Department system. She also provided the State Department with 55,000 pages' worth of emails per their request after she left office as secretary of state, but she retained personal emails unrelated to State Department business. Clinton also claimed she requested that the State Department make these emails available to the public.[44]\nPublic apology\nOn September 8, 2015, Clinton apologized for using the private email server while serving as secretary of state. She said, “I take responsibility and I am trying to be as transparent as I possibly can.”[45] Clinton told ABC News that her conduct had been a “mistake,” but she also said, “I am confident by the end of this campaign, people will know they can trust me, and that I will be on their side and I will fight for them and their families. But I do think I could have and should have done a better job answering questions earlier. I really didn’t, perhaps, appreciate the need to do that.”[45]\nClinton had previously avoided apologizing in an interview with NBC News' Andrea Mitchell on September 4, 2015. When Mitchell asked Clinton if she was sorry, she responded, \"Well, I certainly wish that I had made a different choice and I know why the American people have questions about it and I want to make sure that I answer those questions. Starting with the fact that my personal email use was fully above board, it was allowed by the State Department, as they have confirmed, but in retrospect, it certainly would have been better.”[46] CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod commented that Clinton’s evolving responses to the email investigation lengthened the process. “She's trying to bring this thing to an end so she can be heard on other subjects, but she needs a consistent answer,” said Axelrod.[47][48]\nState Department's disclosures\nFirst batch of emails released\nOn May 22, 2015, the State Department made public 296 emails related to Benghazi between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. They included initial exchanges between Clinton and her aides about when she should make a statement regarding the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens following the attack on the embassy. Two weeks later, Jacob Sullivan, a Clinton aide, sent a detailed 24-page study of every statement Clinton made after the attacks, assuring her, \"You never said spontaneous [sic] or characterized the motives.

Health systems must take particular care when implementing these solutions.\nWhat Are Resource Allocation Algorithms?\nHealth care operations cover a wide range of staffing, scheduling, supply chain management, financial, and other administrative workflows. AI/ML-based tools are increasingly used to aid with health care operations — allocating or otherwise optimizing resources.\nHospitals often operate on relatively slim margins (especially since the onset of the pandemic), so using AI to increase efficiency and optimize the use of scarce resources makes sense.\nOptimizing scarce resources is particularly important, as such resource allocation decisions can be fraught and take time that hospital staff may not have. Allocating scarce resources is generally governed by medical ethics. Especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, ethical approaches to resource allocation abound.\nAlgorithms may recommend who should receive limited assets, like hospital beds, or limited personnel resources, like clinician time. For example, a hospital may use an algorithm that predicts patient deterioration from COVID-19 to allocate ventilators. Or, a health system may use an algorithm that predicts a patient’s risk of severe illness to allocate care management resources.\nRisks And Impacts Of Resource Allocation Algorithms\nHealth care algorithms used to allocate resources do not carry the same risk to individual patient health as, say, an algorithm that diagnoses breast cancer based on MRI scans. However, the use of resource allocation algorithms does impact access to care and the level of care patients receive. When an algorithm is biased, hospitals may deny patients needed resources.\nIn a well-known example, an algorithm designed to allocate care management resources under-estimated the care needs of Black patients and over-estimated the care needs of white patients. Black patients were therefore less likely to receive enhanced care management than white patients.\nOn a population level, biased or improperly used resource allocation algorithms can worsen existing inequities in health care. If an algorithm is less likely to recommend enhanced resources to Black and Brown patients, health systems may withhold more resources from already underserved patient populations.\nDespite their potential for harm, these algorithms remain unregulated.\nThe Regulatory Gap\nUnlike clinical algorithms, resource allocation algorithms cannot be regulated by the FDA as a medical device. These algorithms fall well outside the definition of a medical device, as they focus on the provision and administration of health care.\nHospitals may decide to use resource allocations algorithms based on concerns of biased clinician decision-making. Providers may prefer that an algorithm make these frequent but difficult decisions. Health systems may view these tools as impartial when they in fact can encode the existing bias in health care.\nBut without a regulatory framework, health care organizations are ill-equipped to quantify the risk associated with implementing these algorithms. Resource allocation algorithm vendors are not required to share algorithm development information with regulators or purchasing health care organizations. Therefore, hospitals may not know whether the algorithm was trained on a diverse data set or whether the algorithm has been sufficiently tested. Despite their experience navigating complex ethical waters in resource allocation, they still may not catch algorithmically encoded bia\nDoc 2(Title: Abstract) Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving tool revolutionizing many aspects of healthcare. AI has been predominantly employed in medicine and healthcare administration. However, in public health, the widespread employment of AI only began recently, with the advent of COVID-19. This review examines the advances of AI in public health and the potential challenges that lie ahead. Some of the ways AI has aided public health delivery are via spatial modeling, risk prediction, misinformation control, public health surveillance, disease forecasting, pandemic/epidemic modeling, and health diagnosis. However, the implementation of AI in public health is not universal due to factors including limited infrastructure, lack of technical understanding, data paucity, and ethical/privacy issues.\nKeywords: artificial intelligence (AI), public health, healthcare, review, health policy\n1. Introduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a vast field that includes a variety of methodologies, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning (1). These methods are useful for pattern recognition, prediction, and large-scale data analysis. AI has the potential to be transformative within the healthcare domain. AI has been applied to disease diagnostics, helped forecast the development of infectious diseases, and find novel medication targets (2). AI has also been used to guide interpretation of medical imagining, and drug discovery and delivery (3). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a shift in the exploitation of AI from medicine to public health. During the pandemic, AI was integral to forecasting COVID-19 spread, contact tracing, pharmacovigilance, and rapid testing and detection (4, 5). The implementation of some of these epidemiology informatics tools aided global efforts to cut the spread of the COVID-19 virus and improved patient care. Table 1 highlights some examples of how AI was employed to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTable 1.\nOther potential advantages of AI for public health including increased effectiveness, precision, and scalability of public health treatments. AI can also assist in locating novel insights and patterns that human analysts might miss (18). There are, however, significant ethical and regulatory concerns that must be addressed, such as data privacy and bias in AI systems. In addition, the exploitation of AI to improve public health is not spread evenly across the globe. Some of the major factors that potentially impede the advancement of AI in public health are data availability/governance, availability of related infrastructure, technical skills gap, and the possibility of inequity/bias due to data discrepancies (19). To ensure that the technology is used ethically and responsibly, researchers, healthcare practitioners, and policymakers must work together to integrate AI into healthcare systems. This article reviews recent trends in AI for public health and considers both the potential benefits and challenges of this technology.\n2. Methods\nThis study employed a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Scoping Review approach to comprehensively explore the application of AI to improve public health (20, 21). Relevant electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) were carefully searched using appropriate keywords and controlled vocabulary terms related to AI and public health. Initial screening of titles and abstracts was conducted to identify potentially relevant studies. Full-text articles of the selected studies were retrieved and evaluated for eligibility based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies that focused on the application of AI in public health and were published in English. Exclusion criteria included studies unrelated to public health, studies published in languages other than English, and studies lacking full-text availability. Findings were synthesiz\nDoc 3(Title: Abstract) Telemedicine is the use of technology to provide healthcare services and information remotely, without requiring physical proximity between patients and healthcare providers. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the rapid growth of telemedicine worldwide. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into telemedicine has the potential to enhance and expand its capabilities in addressing various healthcare needs, such as patient monitoring, healthcare information technology (IT), intelligent diagnosis, and assistance. Despite the potential benefits, implementing AI in telemedicine presents challenges that can be overcome with physician-guided implementation. AI can assist physicians in decision-making, improve healthcare delivery, and automate administrative tasks. To ensure optimal effectiveness, AI-powered telemedicine should comply with existing clinical practices and adhere to a framework adaptable to various technologies. It should also consider technical and scientific factors, including trustworthiness, reproducibility, usability, availability, and cost. Education and training are crucial for the appropriate use of new healthcare technologies such as AI-enabled telemedicine. This article examines the benefits and limitations of AI-based telemedicine in various medical domains and underscores the importance of physician-guided implementation, compliance with existing clinical practices, and appropriate education and training for healthcare providers.\nKeywords: Artificial intelligence (AI), COVID-19, intensive care unit (ICU), telemedicine, telehealth, tele-ICU\nIntroduction\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and telemedicine represents a state-of-the-art solution in the healthcare industry that boosts medical care accessibility, efficiency, and quality.[1] This integration offers limitless opportunities for tailoring healthcare solutions using AI to cater to specific needs. Telemedicine assisted by AI can improve the patient experience, healthcare outcomes, and the quality of services offered by physicians. By speeding up disease screening and diagnosis, making diagnoses more precise and personalized, and decreasing the necessity for in-person consultations, AI can exhibit a very important role in promoting and facilitating access to integrated health care throughout a person's lifespan. In managing chronic diseases, AI-enabled remote care can enhance communication and connections across various healthcare delivery elements, enabling healthcare professionals for interaction and providing a knowledge repository for managing patients.[2]\nTelemedicine and its importance\nTelemedicine is defined by the World Health Organization as using information and communication technologies to provide healthcare services when distance is a critical factor.[3] The definition encompasses several aspects, such as diagnosing, treating, preventing diseases and injuries, conducting research, and providing continuing education to healthcare providers, with the final aim to promote the health of individuals and communities. Telemedicine is a healthcare method and not a tool; it can be carried out through different modalities, such as live video consultations or store-and-forward messaging systems. Although terms such as telemedicine and telehealth are frequently used interchangeably,[4] they carry separate technical and regulatory definitions, and other terms such as digital health and mobile health are used to provide a broader and more comprehensive view of people's health care in the digital age.\nTelemedicine refers specifically to the provision of healthcare services and consultations through remote technologies such as videoconferencing, while telehealth is a broader term that includes all healthcare services delivered through technology, including remote monitoring, patient education, and medical record management.\nIn other words, telemedicine is a subset of telehealth, which encompasses a wider \nDoc 4(Title: care organizations. Therefore, hospitals may not know whether the algorithm was trained on a diverse data set or whether the algorithm has been sufficiently tested. Despite their experience navigating complex ethical waters in resource allocation, they still may not catch algorithmically encoded bias.) Hospital Oversight\nWithout regulatory oversight, health care organizations should take particular care when implementing resource allocation algorithms. Health systems should work with algorithm developers to ensure that resource allocation algorithms were trained on diverse data sets. They should also ask developers to outline the algorithm’s inputs and consider whether those factors could lead to bias. Finally, implementing health systems should test the algorithms in their own system. Health systems should pay particular attention to whether algorithms over- or under-recommend additional resources for specific patient populations.\nHealth systems that implement resource allocation algorithms without sufficient oversight may worsen the inequities that they intend to alleviate.\nDoc 5(Title: ines that have emerged from COVID-19 that could be considered as a resource for the application of AI for public health. These guidelines provide a framework for countries to use to prepare for and respond to a public health emergency and they highlight the potential of AI to improve public health.) Addressing data security and privacy protection is paramount for the successful application of AI in public health. While the use of patient data from multiple centers is unavoidable for robust and generalizable AI models, ensuring patient privacy and data security remains critical. Collaborative efforts involving data collaboration and sharing through techniques like federated learning offer potential solutions to these challenges (94, 95). The utilization of patient data from multiple centers enhances the diversity and comprehensiveness of AI models, resulting in more accurate and adaptable algorithms. However, this practice must be accompanied by rigorous data de-identification, aggregation, and anonymization protocols to safeguard patient privacy. Compliance with regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) ensures that sensitive patient information is appropriately protected (86). Data collaboration and sharing enable the pooling of insights from multiple sources without centralizing sensitive data. Federated learning, a decentralized approach, allows AI models to be trained across various centers without sharing raw data. Instead, models are collaboratively updated using locally stored data, minimizing privacy risks. This technique ensures that data remains within its source institution while contributing to the development of a powerful, collective AI model (95). Despite its benefits, federated learning faces challenges, such as dealing with heterogeneity across datasets, communication inefficiencies, and ensuring model convergence. Researchers are actively working to overcome these hurdles through algorithmic advancements.\n4. Implications of AI for development of public health policy\nAI can be a valuable tool for the development of public health policy. The ability to draw together various datasets allows insights to be made that would otherwise be difficult to develop with traditional methods. Algorithms can be employed in an iterative manner, with results of policies monitored, and subsequently informing and improving future policies. Leveraging these insights will allow policies to be developed that are better-targeted, impactful and timely. AI has a great deal to offer policymakers but, like all new technologies, trust and education in how to use it effectively and responsibly are critical to its future uptake and usefulness.\nAuthor contributions\nDO: conceptualization, methodology, literature search, writing—review and editing, formal analysis, writing—original draft, data curation, and project administration.

    "question": "Would the UK be better off leaving the European Union?",
    "agent_answer": "From the documents provided, it is evident that the UK's decision to leave the EU has significant implications for both the UK and the EU. Economically, the UK's contribution to the EU budget and the potential for new trade deals with the EU and other countries are key considerations. The UK's departure from the EU customs union and single market will likely lead to changes in trade relations, which could have both positive and negative economic impacts depending on how new trade deals are negotiated.\n\nThe political landscape within the EU has also been affected by the UK's departure, particularly in terms of the balance of power among member states and the influence of various political blocs within the European Parliament. Additionally, the ongoing negotiations and uncertainties surrounding Brexit have impacted the UK's economy and the value of the pound sterling.\n\nIn summary, the economic and political impacts of Brexit are complex and multifaceted, and whether the UK would be better off leaving the EU ultimately depends on the specific terms of the post-Brexit relationship and the ability of the UK to navigate these challenges effectively. A detailed analysis of the economic forecasts and trade negotiations would provide a more definitive answer. However, based on the available information, it appears that the UK's economic situation is not necessarily worsened by being in the EU, and leaving could present both opportunities and risks. The decision would require careful consideration of these factors. \n\n<answer> The UK would be better off leaving the EU if it can successfully negotiate beneficial trade deals and mitigate the risks associated with leaving the single market and customs union.

Unless the budget is reduced, Germany (already the largest net contributor) seems likely to be asked to provide the largest share of the cash, its share estimated at about €2.5 billion.[3]\nAs of March 2020[update], debate continues between those members who wish the budget to be limited to no more than 1% of members' combined GDP and those who want it to be 1.074%.[4]\nReadiness\n[edit]In response to Brexit, the European Commission issued a communication on readiness named: \"Communication on readiness at the end of the transition period between the European Union and the United Kingdom\".[5]\nPolicy changes\n[edit]The years are over when Europe cannot follow a course because the British will object. Now the British are going, Europe can find a new élan.\nThe UK was a major player in the EU which served as both an asset to the Union, but also a hindrance to those who supported a direction firmly opposed by the British government.[6]\nIdeological shift\n[edit]As the EU's third most populous state, with over 12% of the Union's population, the UK was an influential player in the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Its absence will impact the ideological balance within the EU institutions.[7]\n- Council\nIn the Council, during the UK's membership there were two blocs, each capable of forming a blocking minority against the other: the protectionist bloc of mainly southern states and the liberal bloc of mainly northern states. As a member of the latter, the UK's departure will weaken the liberal bloc as the UK has been a sizeable and fervent proponent of an economically liberal Europe, larger trade deals with third countries and of further EU enlargement. While weakening the liberal bloc, it will also strengthen Germany's individual position in the Council through the loss of a key counterweight. However, Germany remains uneasy about this role lest other member states anxious of German dominance may be more tempted to ally against it.[7][8]\n- European Parliament\nIn the European Parliament, Brexit led to changes in group representation: Brexit gave 5 seats to the EPP and 3 seats to the ID, while 29 seats were lost by the NI (including Brexit party) 11 seats lost by the Renew Europe (LibDem) 7 seats losts by the green, and six seats lost by the alliance of socialists and democrats (S&D).\nSimilarly, a majority of the UK's representatives sat with right-leaning groups, namely the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy, both of which were built around, and led by members of, the British Conservative Party and UKIP. The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats also lost its members from the UK's Labour Party, but on the whole would be left strengthened by t\nDoc 2(Title: rack Survey Results\" (PDF).

On June 23, 2016, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. The best single reason for the U.K. to leave the European Union at the end of October is that this is what the British people voted to do.) It’s been a long time coming. Brexit was supposed to happen at the end of March. But the deadline has been extended twice, as the House of Commons rejected every possible approach to resolving the crisis.\nThe delays are unpopular, as demonstrated by recent election results. The governing Conservative Party suffered a smashing defeat in the local elections, while the European elections delivered a stunning victory for the new Brexit Party, which has as its only goal getting Britain out of the EU.\nWhat has stopped many MPs from heeding the voters and supporting an immediate exit from the EU is fear that Britain will suffer economically if it leaves. Or, to put it more exactly, Conservative MPs are afraid that leaving the EU will damage their party’s reputation for economic competence — a reputation they see as key to defeating Jeremy Corbyn’s far-left Labour Party.\nThis fear is misplaced. EU membership is no guarantee of prosperity. Germany is prosperous, but Greece, also a member of the EU, has been immiserated. Inside or outside the EU, prosperity depends first and foremost on the wisdom of your national policies.\nFor Britain, the EU adds relatively little economic value. British exports of goods go disproportionately to the world outside the EU, so the EU’s common market is of less use to it. Unfortunately, the EU has never been able to create a truly common market in services, in which Britain dominates. And the UK imports a lot of food, which the EU makes more expensive.\nBeing in the EU means Britain gives preference to talent from Europe, a rich but small region, not talent from around the world. And the EU loves to regulate, which adds costs that Britain has to pay.\nOf course, leaving the EU immediately is not going to be all smooth sailing. Britain cannot leave a trading and regulatory area it has been part of since 1973 without some bumps. But it is the government’s job to prepare for and to minimize those bumps.\nThe fact that people are still concerned about the bumps goes to show what a bad job the British government has done in its exit negotiations with the EU. It managed to work itself into a corner by not preparing fully for exiting without a deal, while the deal it did negotiate turned out to be a bad one.\nBut Britain still has time to redeem those mistakes. After Prime Minister Theresa May’s successor is chosen, the new government will have about three months to prepare for exiting the EU without a deal. It can also use that time to restart the negotiations with the EU.\nIf those negotiations produce a genuine free trade area between the EU and the U.K., that would be ideal. But the odds of such a success are very low. The EU likes the unacceptable deal it has already negotiated and has no desire to change it. Britain must be fully prepared to walk away in October.\nThe recent elections show what will happen if Britain extends the Brexit deadline again. Political parties are realigning, with every vote now a referendum on Brexit. Both the Conservative and the Labour parties are suffering as a result: the Conservatives because their supporters want Brexit, and Labour because its supporters have no idea what it wants.\nConservative MPs should recognize that the biggest peril facing their party is failing to finish the job voters gave them in 2016. And Labour MPs should recognize that they risk a wipeout, with working-class voters heading to the Brexit Party and the urban rich drifting to the rival Liberal Democrats.\nThe economic consequences of Brexit will be low in the short run, and positive in the long run. The Irish border problem can be solved if there is good will between Britain and Ireland, as there must be.\nTh\nDoc 4(Title: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Statement for the Record Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community) \ntariffs and may\n\ndelay ratifying the USMCA until those concerns are addressed.\n\n• US-EU trade, valued at $1.2 trillion in 2017, would almost certainly suffer disruptions from a\n\nno-deal Brexit, which would further dampen UK—and to a lesser extent EU—economic\n\ngrowth.

The economic consequences of Brexit will be low in the short run, and positive in the long run. The Irish border problem can be solved if there is good will between Britain and Ireland, as there must be.\nThe greatest risk in Britain today is that the British people were told that the 2016 referendum was their chance to choose the destiny of their nation. Any economic risks attached to Brexit are nothing compared to the political risk of denying the people the voice they were promised.\nThis piece originally appeared in Inside Sources\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the documents provided, it is evident that the UK's decision to leave the EU has significant implications for both the UK and the EU. Economically, the UK's contribution to the EU budget and the potential for new trade deals with the EU and other countries are key considerations. The UK's departure from the EU customs union and single market will likely lead to changes in trade relations, which could have both positive and negative economic impacts depending on how new trade deals are negotiated.\n\nThe political landscape within the EU has also been affected by the UK's departure, particularly in terms of the balance of power among member states and the influence of various political blocs within the European Parliament. Additionally, the ongoing negotiations and uncertainties surrounding Brexit have impacted the UK's economy and the value of the pound sterling.\n\nIn summary, the economic and political impacts of Brexit are complex and multifaceted, and whether the UK would be better off leaving the EU ultimately depends on the specific terms of the post-Brexit relationship and the ability of the UK to navigate these challenges effectively. A detailed analysis of the economic forecasts and trade negotiations would provide a more definitive answer. However, based on the available information, it appears that the UK's economic situation is not necessarily worsened by being in the EU, and leaving could present both opportunities and risks. The decision would require careful consideration of these factors. \n\n<answer> The UK would be better off leaving the EU if it can successfully negotiate beneficial trade deals and mitigate the risks associated with leaving the single market and customs union.

It compares the views of candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald S. Trump on the Affordable Care Act, climate change, prescription drug pricing, prevention of injuries and deaths from firearms, and the opioids epidemic; and offers perspectives on the potential impact of the election not only on U.S. health care policy, but on the health of American democracy itself.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis manuscript is based on the Betty and Herb Dupont Lecture at the Americal Clinical and Climatological Association on October 22, 2016. For the lecture, I conducted an extensive evidence review, mainly through Google, on the trends influencing the 2016 election, and on the election’s potential impact on US health care policy. This manuscript describes the findings of my evidence review, interprets and analyzes them, and offers perspectives on the implications not only for US health care but also the health of American democracy. Because the lecture took place prior to the November 8 election, this paper does not specifically comment on the results of the election, although the perspectives offered on how Donald S. Trump’s positions as a candidate, compared to those of former Secretary of State Hillary R. Rodham, are relevant to any conversation about what Mr. Trump’s election and continued Republican control of Congress bodes for health care policy.\nINTRODUCTION\nHunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, which chronicled the 1972 Nixon versus McGovern campaign, was described by the New York Times as “the best account yet published” of a modern American presidential campaign (1). “What makes the story so painful, and so painfully funny” writes Matt Taibbi in his introduction to the book’s 40th anniversary edition, “is that Hunter chooses the presidential campaign, of all places, to conduct this hopeless search for truth and justice. It’s probably worse now than it was in Hunter’s day, but the American presidential campaign is the last place in the world a sane man would go in search of anything like honesty. It may be the most fake place on earth” (2).\nThe same might be said of the 2016 election; an election characterized by personal attacks, misinformation, and relentless negativity, as voters are being asked to choose between two major party candidates who most distrust and view unfavorably—a “lesser of two evils” choice to many. This isn’t the first “lesser evils” election; in Fear and Loathing, Hunter wrote, “How many more of these stinking, double-downer sideshows will we have to go through before we can get ourselves straight enough to put together some kind of national election that will give me and the at least 20 million people I tend to agree with a chance to vote FOR something, instead of always being faced with that old familiar choice between the lesser of two evils?” (1)\nYet, like the choices or not, the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or businessman Donald S. Trump will result in starkly different outcomes for America’s health care system. It’s not just health care that is at stake; it’s the health of our democratic system of government itself.\nThe anger and distrust evidenced by large swaths of the electorate today, and the poisonous atmosphere that it has introduced into the election, didn’t just suddenly arise. It came about because of four trends—reactions to changing demographics; distrust of government; partisanship and gridlock; and now, populism—that have been gathering steam for decades, only to come to a head in this election.\nCHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS\n“The U.S. electorate this year will be the country’s most racially and ethnically diverse ever.

To learn more about millennials’ parenting styles, we surveyed 1,000 millennial parents across the U.S. As of 2024, millennials range in age from 28-43. We found many millennials are taking a different parenting path than their parents did, seeking advice from the internet, juggling work and family obligations, and navigating conversations around mental health.\nKey Findings:\n- 73% millennial parents believe their parenting style is better than past generations\n- 3 in 4 millennial parents practice gentle parenting\n- Nearly half (46%) of millennial parents feel burned out\n- Navigating a digital world: 85% believe social media creates unrealistic parenting expectations and 1 in 4 don’t double check parenting advice from social media\n- 80% believe discussions with children around mental health are very important\n- Work-life balance: 82% of millennial parents work and 4 in 5 prioritize children over careers\nNavigating Generational Parenting Styles\nMillennial parents are doing things differently. Nearly 9 in 10 (88%) say their parenting style is different from how they were raised, and 3 in 4 (73%) believe they are better parents than their parents. With that in mind, 1 in 3 say their family members question their parenting methods.\n\"Gentle parenting should not be confused with permissiveness and accommodation of behavior,” says Miller Shivers, PhD, pediatric psychologist in The Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Lurie Children’s. “Children need limits and a certain amount of structure to best function. I worry that the emphasis on gentle parenting leads parents to believe that they have to be ok with all kinds of negative behavior from their children and that they cannot set limits and have consequences.”\nNearly 3 in 4 (74%) millennial parents practice gentle parenting which is characterized by helping guide children through the decision-making process and not threatening or punishing them. Gentle parenting focuses on a partnership between parents and children with an emphasis on communication, empathy, respect, and boundaries.\nTop 3 ways millennial parenting styles are different from past generations:\n- More open communication\n- Greater emphasis on emotional intelligence\n- More flexible parenting styles\nThe Impact of Technology and Social Media on Millennial Parenting\nParenting in the 21st Century brings additional challenges previous generations did not face, especially when it comes to technology and social media. Nearly half (46%) of millennial parents feel burned out with 85% believing social media creates unrealistic parenting expectations.\nFurther demonstrating the challenges technology can pose, 30% of millennial moms say they compare their parenting success to others on social media.\nThe top places millennials report getting parenting advice include:\n- Family\n- Talking to other parents\n- Friends\n- Books\n- Social Media\nAmong parents, 24% have received parenting advice from a social media influencer, but 1 in 4 admit to not double-checking the advice they get from social media.\n“Parenting suggestions on social media don’t take into account the individual child and what is contributing to the issue, and anyone can give advice on social media without any real expertise,” explains Dr. Shivers. “Therefore, it can foster unrealistic expectations for parents that managing behavior and difficult issues is easily solved with a small snippet of advice.”\nNavigating Mental Health Conversations and Raising Emotionally Intelligent Children\nMillennial parents are trying to put more emphasis on mental health and talking about it with their children.

Among them, 47% have a child that experiences anxiety and 12% currently have a child in therapy. Among parents with children in therapy, 1 in 5 hesitate to tell others for fear of judgment.\nDespite this, 80% think discussions about mental health and emotional well-being are very important in shaping a child’s overall development. There’s a stark contrast between the generations and discussing mental health: 2 in 3 millennial parents say their parents never talked with them about mental health while 98% of millennial parents talk with their children about it.\n“Discussing emotions is a healthy part of development for children but it can be intimidating and uncomfortable for parents who are unaccustomed to discussing such things,” says Dr. Shivers. “There is a fine line between having an open discussion and parents trying to fix things for their child. Often children just want a place to say what is on their mind, so parents should be cautious about jumping in with solutions. Supporting children as they struggle is part of healthy development (albeit it, hard for parents) and swooping in to solve their problems does not prepare them for the future or enable them to learn their own problem-solving abilities.”\nWhile 80% of millennial parents believe they set a good example for their children in dealing with stress and supporting mental health, they admit it isn’t easy. The top challenges millennial parents experience in talking with their kids about mental health include difficulty finding the right words, struggling to determine if a child understands, and fear of making things worse.\nMore than 4 in 5 (82%) millennial parents work. Among them, 58% say it’s hard to balance their work and home life. Millennial moms feel this slightly more with 63% facing challenges between work and home life, while 55% of dads struggle with the balance. The majority (4 in 5) prioritize their children over their careers, especially moms (81% vs. 78% dads).\nThe biggest challenges millennial parents face include dealing with stress, finances, raising children in a digital age, parental guilt, and balancing work and family life. Despite the challenges, 77% of millennials believe they're more present with their children than their parents were.\nNavigating parenthood in 2024 isn’t an easy feat. As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child, and parents don’t have to go through this process alone. There’s no perfect playbook for parenting, but each generation is figuring out the way that works best for them and their families.\nMethodology\nIn December 2023, we conducted a survey of 1,000 millennial parents (ages 27-42) from across the U.S. about their parenting experience. Among respondents, 50% identified as male, 49% as female, and 1% as non-binary with an average age of 35.\nFor media inquiries, contact media@digitalthirdcoast.net\nFair Use\nWhen using this data and research, please attribute by linking to this study and citing Lurie Children’s.\nSign up for our Newsletter\nGet health tips from our pediatric experts, news about ground-breaking research, and feel-good moments delivered right to your inbox.\nAdditional Blog Posts\nReturning to School After a Diabetes Diagnosis\nReturning a child to school after a diabetes diagnosis is a big transition.

We try to address this not with sweeping predictions or grand theories, but with mathematical projections that combine techniques standardly used in demography (the study of human populations) with data we have collected in surveys on religion.) Demographers project the growth or shrinkage of populations based on factors such as age, sex, fertility, mortality and migration. For religious populations, projections also need to include data on “switching” – voluntary movement into and out of religious groups. Finally, the shifting sizes of U.S. religious groups depend partly on rates of religious transmission – whether parents pass their religious identity on to their children. In this report, Pew Research Center has incorporated estimates of “intergenerational transmission of religion” into our projections for the first time.\nSwitching rates are estimated based on responses from more than 15,000 adults to two questions posed in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey: “In what religion, if any, were you raised?” and “What is your present religion, if any?” Results were weighted to the Center’s National Public Opinion Reference Survey, conducted by mail and online in 2020. Long-term cohort trends in switching (going back to the 1970s) come from two similar questions in the long-running General Social Survey: “In what religion were you raised?” and “What is your religious preference?”\nShifts in religious identity, or switching, are concentrated among young adults. During earlier childhood years, a parent’s religion (or lack thereof) is often, but not always, transmitted to a child. Rates of transmission for three identity categories (Christian, other religion, and religiously unaffiliated) are estimated based on the percentages of teens (ages 13 to 17) who shared their mother’s religious affiliation in a 2019 survey of 1,811 pairs of U.S. parents and teens. These observed patterns are used to model whether future generations of newborn children inherit their mother’s religion.\nGroup differences in fertility (the number of children women tend to have), migration and age structures also drive change. Fertility differences by religion are based on the National Survey of Family Growth, while the average U.S. fertility rate used in each period is based on the 2019 revision of United Nations World Populations Prospect data. Migration data comes from the UN. Religious composition by age and sex groups is based on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel. We estimate the religious composition of children based on the religious composition of young adults, and fertility patterns.\nThe various input data is used in projection models to illustrate what the future religious composition of the U.S. might look like under a range of hypothetical scenarios. See Methodology for more information on inputs and modeling.\nSince the 1990s, large numbers of Americans have left Christianity to join the growing ranks of U.S. adults who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular.” This accelerating trend is reshaping the U.S. religious landscape, leading many people to wonder what the future of religion in America might look like.\nWhat if Christians keep leaving religion at the same rate observed in recent years? What if the pace of religious switching continues to accelerate? What if switching were to stop, but other demographic trends – such as migration, births and deaths – were to continue at current rates? To help answer such questions, Pew Research Center has modeled several hypothetical scenarios describing how the U.S. religious landscape might change over the next half century.\nThe Center estimates that in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones,” acc\nDoc 5(Title: 8.Romero-Martínez A., Moya-Albiol L.

The Hiddenness of God\nThe hiddenness of God is often proposed as evidence that God does not exist.1 Atheists who advance this argument can affirm that there may be some evidence that God exists, such as the Big Bang, the fine-tuning of the universe, and the existence of objective moral facts. However, this limited evidence is far less than what we ought to expect. If the Christian God exists and loves us, and if our eternal destiny hangs in the balance, why isn’t the evidence for his existence absolutely undeniable? Surely, a God who could create the entire universe could routinely perform unmistakable miracles, like regularly sending angels to materialize in the center of Times Square in the presence of thousands of witnesses. The absence of such extraordinary evidence is, then, an indication that this kind of God does not exist.\nTo answer this objection, we need to take a deeper look at the biblical doctrine of sin. According to the Bible, sin is not merely the breaking of God’s rules; it stems from our inherent posture of rebellion toward God. To put it another way, if faith is essentially trust in God, then unbelief is essentially mistrust of God. We don’t merely doubt his existence; we doubt his goodness. We distrust his claim that he knows what is best for us and that surrendering to his rule over our lives will bring us joy and freedom. The claim here is not that intellectual objections don’t exist or that they are unimportant, but that they are not the primary obstacle between us and God. As surprising as it might seem, lack of evidence is not the ultimate reason for our unbelief.\nWhy Believe?\nNeil Shenvi\nWhy Believe? engages some of the best contemporary arguments against belief, presenting compelling evidence for the truth of Christianity and calling readers to entrust their lives to Christ.\nA Question after Being Convinced\nIf that claim sounds difficult to accept, a thought experiment might help. Imagine you are about to head to bed when Jesus suddenly appears in the middle of your living room. He shows you the nail prints in his hands and performs miracles, multiplying your avocado toast and fish sticks and turning your tap water into wine. In other words, imagine, for the sake of argument, that he gives you whatever evidence you need to completely convince you intellectually that he is God, that he died on the cross for your sins, and that he rose from the dead. The question I’d like you to consider is not whether you would believe that God exists or that Christianity is true, because we’re granting for the sake of argument that these issues have been settled for you. The question is this: How do you feel about him?\nAt that moment, what if Jesus said to you: “Now that you know that I am God, I am calling you to become my disciple. That means you must take up your cross daily, dying to your own desires and demands, and seeking my will in all your decisions. I must be more important to you than any human relationship and even more important to you than your own life. You must put to death all the sins that you love and that seem so natural to you, even if it feels as difficult as plucking out your right eye or cutting off your right hand. Your money, your friendships, your sex life, your career goals, your entertainment, your entire ethical framework, your view of the Bible—everything must be reevaluated in light of who I am. I want you to devote your whole life to my mission, serving others, loving them, sacrificing for them, warning them about God’s coming judgment, and pointing them to the forgiveness of sins and salvation that only I offer. Tell all your friends and family the bad news that they are sinners and the unimaginably good news that I died to rescue them from hell. Devote yourself to prayer, to worship, to friendship with other Christians, to membership in the local church. And do all of these things not grudgingly, but joyfully.”\nBe honest: how \nDoc 2(Title: Learn more about ActiveChristianity, or explore our theme pages for more) From atheism to Christianity: How I know God exists\nI never expected to become someone who believed in God.\nHow do I know if God is real?\nDiscovering God is an extremely personal experience. How this happens can vary a lot from person to person. As a science student I traveled the path from atheism to Christianity and I hope my story can give inspiration to those who are in need.\nI never expected to become someone who believed in God.\nI grew up as an atheist; my goal in life was to find objective truths through science. I specialized in math and physics in high school, and later completed a Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Physics.\nThere isn’t physical evidence that can be used to prove or disprove the existence of God. This means that it wouldn’t be scientific to claim that God does or doesn’t exist. Whether we believe in God or we don’t, our belief is something we have chosen.\nWhen I was younger, I chose not to believe in God. This was based, in part, on the very negative perception of Christianity I had at the time. My impression was that Christians acted as if they were superior – they claimed that they had religious faith and, at the same time, they willingly lived unrighteous lives. This hypocrisy disgusted me. I didn’t want to believe that God had a plan to bring salvation for such people.\nLike what youâre reading?\nThe limitations of science\nAs I grew older, I began to have questions that science does not provide answers for. When I was still in high school I often wondered: “What is my purpose in life?”\nI was ambitious and had plenty of motivation. However, it wasn’t long until I became discouraged by the walls that I faced. I sensed that something was lacking in my life. I felt the fear of uncertainty and meaninglessness. I was afraid of failing.\nScience is a powerful tool for describing the world that we see. It helps us to build models for analyzing what we observe, to make formulas to predict how a system will evolve, and it provides a way to prove or disprove our hypotheses. But science couldn’t provide a solution to the struggles I was facing in life.\nRead also: A reflection on the meaning of life\nA new understanding of Christianity\nIn the midst of my struggles, a classmate managed to convince me to visit the church that he attends. At this gathering, someone read from a book written by the founder of their church, Johan Oscar Smith. A few sentences stuck out and immediately provoked my curiosity. “The world and its lusts are nothing; they are emptiness. The pleasures of the world are just a glittering gateway into even greater emptiness.” ¹\nThis rang true in my heart! As a young person, my heart was longing for a sense of belonging. I often worked to become something, seeking recognition so that people would “love” me! Yet, I feared that if I failed, they would discard me.\nThat was my motivation to strive after achievements, money and fame! But this only led to a greater need to be praised by the others! In short, I saw how I was lured by the pleasure and lust of this world – and it was clear to see that it wasn’t going to end well.\nHere was an explanation for my feelings of emptiness; feelings which science could not explain or provide a solution for. How did I resolve this problem? How could I break through this bondage?\nIn the time that followed I continued to attend these meetings to learn more about what for me was a new understanding of Christianity. I heard more about the cause of many of my struggles: the lusts and desires that exist within me, or my own demands and expectations. As I sought to be accepted by others, for example, I saw that I was driven by my own expectations of how I thought they should behave. I became irritated and dissatisfied when others didn’t meet my expectations and I found that I could not truly and selflessly love them.\nWhat really kept me bound was myself. And the solution Christianity offers, is to follow Je\nDoc 3(Title:  and family the bad news that they are sinners and the unimaginably good news that I died to rescue them from hell. Devote yourself to prayer, to worship, to friendship with other Christians, to membership in the local church. And do all of these things not grudgingly, but joyfully.”) Be honest: how would you feel about Jesus now? I’ll be honest. Part of me would feel claustrophobic. Even as a Christian, part of me wants to call the shots in my own life and wants to be my own ultimate authority. God’s demand for our complete allegiance makes us feel uncomfortable. Why? Because deep down inside, we want to be our own gods. If that’s the case, isn’t it clear that evidence is not the ultimate issue? Even if we had all the evidence we needed to convince us intellectually that God exists and that Christianity is true, there would still be a volitional, emotional barrier between us and God.\nDeep down inside, we want to be our own gods. If that’s the case, isn’t it clear that evidence is not the ultimate issue?\nThat is why, at least from a Christian perspective, the objection from divine hiddenness is weak. I agree that God could have provided even more evidence than he did, so much evidence that atheism or skepticism of any kind would cease to exist. But why think that a world of theists who loathed God would be significantly more desirable to God than our current world?\nGod’s purpose is to change hearts, not merely to change minds. Once we grant that a person can be completely intellectually convinced that God exists and still fail to love God, we have to reevaluate whether God would necessarily provide more evidence than he has. If none of us can honestly say that there is nothing in the Bible that disturbs us, nothing about God’s total claim over our lives that threatens us, and nothing about God’s moral commands that offends us, then why think that lack of evidence is our main problem or that God ought to provide more?\nNotes:\n- See, for example, John L. Schellenberg, “Divine Hiddenness Justifies Atheism,” in Evil and the Hiddenness of God, ed. Michael Rea (Stamford, CT: Cengage Learning, 2015), 61–70.\nThis article is adapted from Why Believe?: A Reasoned Approach to Christianity by Neil Shenvi.\nRelated Articles\nOne Argument for the Existence of God: Mathematics\nThe success of mathematics in describing the universe is a fact that most of us, even scientists like me, take for granted. Yet it is actually extremely surprising.\nHow to Believe against Your Feelings\nSome people stop following Christ because they enjoy other things more than Jesus. To them, Christianity just isn’t satisfying anymore. So how should you deal with this important issue?\nWhy the Message of Salvation Is Evidence of the Truth of Christianity\nIsn't it obvious that most Christians adopt their beliefs on the basis of emotion or tradition or culture, rather than on the basis of reason and evidence? This is an interesting objection. How could we respond?\nWhy Seek the Truth? The Achilles’ Heel of Free Thought\nAtheists and agnostics insist we pursue the truth about reality—even if the idea of a meaningless universe frightens and depresses us. We ought to face facts and accept reality as it is, not as we want it to be.\nDoc 4(Title: Omnipotence paradox) The omnipotence paradox is a family of paradoxes that arise with some understandings of the term omnipotent. The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even a logically contradictory one such as creating a square circle. Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for countering theism. Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether omnipotence is directed toward God himself or outward toward his external surroundings.\nThe omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 10th century, when Saadia Gaon responded to the question of whether God's omnipotence extended to logical absurdities.[1] It was later addressed by Averroes[2] and Thomas Aquinas.[3] Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to \"deny himself\".\nThe best-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the paradox of the stone: \"Could God create a stone so heavy that even he could not lift it?\" This is a paradoxical question because if God could create something he could not lift, then he would not be omnipotent. Similarly, if God was able to lift the stone then that would mean he was unable to create something he could not lift, leading to the same result. Alternative statements of the paradox include \"If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?\" and \"Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?\".\nOverview\n[edit]A common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: \"Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?\" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being can create a stone that it cannot lift, then it is not omnipotent because there is a weight threshold beyond its own power to lift. If the being cannot create a stone it cannot lift, then there is something it cannot create, and is therefore not omnipotent. In either case, the being is not omnipotent.[4] This modern version is referred to as the Paradox of the Stone.\nA related issue is whether the concept of \"logically possible\" is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.\nThe dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox—the irresistible force paradox: \"What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?\" One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Another response to this that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. However this does not hold up under scrutiny, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.[5]\nTypes of omnipotence\n[edit]Augustine of Hippo in his City of God writes \"God is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills\" and thus proposes the definition that \"Y is omnipotent\" means \"If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X\".\nThe notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An essentially omnipotent being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an accidentally omnipotent being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.[6]\nIn addition, some philos\nDoc 5(Title: my limited abilities to publicly convict disbelievers of God's reality, I would have thought they were insane. Nonetheless, God has blessed my feeble efforts in spectacular ways — totally beyond anything I could have ever done.) I want to close this lesson by asking you a very simple question — a question that you need to answer for yourself and that each person needs to answer I suppose nearly every day. Are you an atheist (not perhaps as man would define it, but as God defines it)? Are you an atheist? Oh, I realize you may not be the kind of atheist that I was. Perhaps you are not immoral or hurting people or dishonest or doing the kinds of things that I did. I am thankful that you are not, but do you realize the way Jesus views an atheist? Matthew 12:30 says, “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” What is he saying? He is saying that you are either for God or you are against God. You are either an atheist or a Christian; you cannot be both. I can understand how a man can be an atheist. I had been an atheist a good part of my life. As an atheist, I believed (and still believe) that my life was consistent, reasonable, and defendable.\nFor a many years now, I have been trying to live what I understand to be the Christian way of life. Once again, I believe my life is consistent, reasonable, and defendable with what I believe, but I will never understand (and if you understand, I wish you would explain it to me) how a man or a woman or a boy or a girl can say, “Yes, I believe in God. Yes, I understand that the Bible is God's Word,” and then not do everything and anything within their power to make sure their lives conform to what that God teaches. That is not consistent, not reasonable, and not defendable, yet I am sure there are many people who know that their life is not consistent with God's way of living. Jesus said, “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” Are you for Christ? Are you working for Christ? Is your life radiating the kind of living that Jesus taught? Are you really a Christian or are you an atheist? There is no middle ground. It is my hope that by revealing to you the kind of person I had been and the mistakes I had made, you have realized that God is the only way. It is my prayer that you have realized that there is nothing that can be a part of your life that God cannot help you overcome and that you also realize that there is no better time than right now to begin the Christian way of living. Will you not give yourself to God and live Christ's Way?

This question highlights a major shift in how justice systems and societies respond to crime. Rather than focusing solely on retribution, rehabilitation emphasizes transformation, reintegration, and long-term safety. Below, we explore why rehabilitation is often seen as a more effective and humane approach than punishment.) TL;DR\nRehabilitation is considered better than punishment because it reforms individuals, tackles root causes of crime, and reduces reoffending. It enhances public safety, lowers costs compared to long-term incarceration, and provides a humane, evidence-based alternative. While it requires resources and commitment, rehabilitation supports reintegration and builds stronger communities, making it more effective than punishment alone.\nUnlock Criminal Justice Counseling Solutions Today!\nRehabilitation vs Punishment\n- Rehabilitation: Focuses on helping individuals reform and reintegrate into society.\n- Punishment: Emphasizes retribution or deterrence, often through penalties like incarceration.\nThis difference sets the foundation for why rehabilitation is increasingly prioritized.\nAdvantages of Rehabilitation over Punishment\nRehabilitation represents a shift from retribution to transformation. Instead of focusing on penalties alone, it emphasizes helping individuals change their behavior and reintegrate into society. The benefits extend not only to offenders but also to communities and the justice system as a whole.\n1. Promoting Long-Term Behavioral Change\nRehabilitation targets the root causes of criminal behavior, offering tools and support for genuine transformation. Instead of merely serving time, individuals work toward reshaping their futures.\n2. Reducing Recidivism Rates\nEvidence shows rehabilitation programs are more effective at lowering reoffending than punitive measures. By tackling underlying problems, rehabilitation reduces the likelihood of repeat offenses and contributes to safer communities.\n3. Economic Benefits\nSustaining prisons is costly. Redirecting resources toward rehabilitation programs not only helps individuals rebuild their lives but also reduces the long-term financial burden on justice systems and taxpayers.\n4. Enhancing Public Safety\nRehabilitation encourages reintegration, helping individuals return as constructive members of society. This focus strengthens public safety and fosters stronger, more cohesive communities.\nRehabilitation in Modern Justice Systems\nAs justice systems evolve, rehabilitation has become a central focus. Supported by evidence and long-term results, it is increasingly seen as a more effective way to reduce crime, improve outcomes for offenders, and strengthen community safety.\n1. A More Humane Approach\nRehabilitation acknowledges that many offenders face significant life challenges. By offering a chance at reform, it reflects a more humane and just way of addressing crime.\n2. Addressing Underlying Issues\nMental health problems, substance abuse, and trauma are common among offenders. Rehabilitation provides treatment and support in these areas, making it more effective than punishment alone.\n3. Evidence-Based Practice\nModern justice systems increasingly adopt rehabilitation because research shows it reduces recidivism and improves long-term outcomes for both individuals and society.\nChallenges of Implementing Rehabilitation\nWhile rehabilitation offers clear benefits, it requires resources, trained professionals, and societal willingness to move away from punitive traditions. These challenges highlight the need for ongoing commitment and investment.\nA Call for a Balanced Approach\nRehabilitation is more effective, humane, and economically sound than punishment. However, in practice, a balanced model that combines elements of both may provide the most just and effective outcomes.\nKey Takeaways\n- Definitions: Rehabilitation = reform and reintegration; Punishment = retribution or deterrence.\n- Long-Term Change:\nDoc 2(Title:  humane, and economically sound than punishment.

These trends raise important questions about the effectiveness of prisons and how well ex-convicts reintegrate into society.\nTime spent in prison can deter offenders from future crime or rehabilitate offenders by providing vocational training or wellness programs. However, incarceration can also lead to recidivism and unemployment due to human capital depreciation, exposure to hardened criminals, or societal and workplace stigma. Incarceration can also have effects beyond those on the offenders themselves, with spillovers to other family members or the offenders’ criminal networks. Importantly, the effects of incarceration may well depend on both prisoner characteristics and prison conditions.\nThe sharp rise in incarceration, particularly in the United States, occurred shortly after the release of an influential report by the sociologist Robert Martinson.1 The report examined the existing evidence on prisoner rehabilitation programs and came to the conclusion that “nothing works.” Ensuing policy discussions gradually led to rehabilitation programs playing a subordinate role to policies emphasizing punishment and incapacitation. While some scholars and policymakers have questioned the “nothing works” doctrine, convincing empirical work on the question remained scarce until recently. As summarized roughly a decade ago, “Remarkably little is known about the effects of imprisonment on reoffending. The existing research is limited in size, in quality, [and] in its insights into why a prison term might be criminogenic or preventative.”2 We also know little about spillovers to other family members or criminal networks.\nThe lack of convincing evidence is primarily due to two factors. First, there are few panel datasets that can track offenders both before and after their time in prison. There are even fewer panel datasets that can link the required labor market, crime, family, and criminal network outcomes. Second, there is selection bias in who is sent to prison. The average convict already has a criminal record and a weak attachment to the labor market, and negative shocks such as job loss often precede imprisonment. The fact that incarceration is not random suggests that analyses based on observational data are unlikely to capture causal effects.\nIn a series of papers with Manudeep Bhuller and Katrine V. Løken, we overcome these data challenges and the nonrandomness of imprisonment, offering new insights into how incarceration affects recidivism, employment, children, and criminal networks.\nThe Norwegian Setting\nOur work studies the effects of incarceration in Norway, a setting with two key advantages. First, we are able to link several administrative data sources to construct a panel dataset containing complete records of the criminal behavior and labor market outcomes of every Norwegian who has been incarcerated. We can further link this information to other family members, including children and siblings. Moreover, we have information on co-offending that allows us to map out criminal networks for observed crimes.\nSecond, we can leverage the random assignment of criminal cases to judges who differ in their propensities to send defendants to prison. Roughly half of all randomly assigned cases result in imprisonment. But some judges send defendants to prison at a high rate, while others are more lenient. We measure a judge’s stringency as the average incarceration rate for all other cases a judge handles, after controlling for court and year fixed effects, which is the level of random assignment. This quasi-random assignment of judge stringency can be used as an instrument for incarceration, as it strongly predicts the judge’s decision in the current case, but is uncorrelated with other case characteristics both by design and empi\nDoc 4(Title: .) Inflicting suffering through punishment is simply not a path to public safety\nAlternatives to harsh prisons and jails exist. Solutions that prioritize growth and health, and that are grounded in dignity and humanity, lead to better outcomes both for people within the criminal legal system and those outside of it.\nStates spend billions of dollars each year on corrections. Imagine if these resources were redirected to jobs, education, health care, and other solutions that help people lead safe and healthy lives.\nWe know how to transform the criminal legal system. It’s past time we do.\nDoc 5(Title: Rehabilitate or punish?) \nstruggle to implement such programs while keeping up with their regular prison caseloads. \"We're focused so much on the basic mental health services that there's not enough time or emphasis to devote to rehabilitative services,\" says Robert Morgan, PhD, a psychologist at Texas Tech University who has worked in federal and state prisons and studies treatment methods for inmates.\n\nPart of the problem is limited resources, says Morgan: There simply aren't enough mental health professionals in most prisons. Haney agrees: \"Many psychologists in the criminal justice system have enormous caseloads; they're struggling not to be overwhelmed by the tide.\"\n\nAnother constraint is the basic philosophical difference between psychology, which is rehabilitative at heart, and corrections, which is currently punishment-oriented.\n\n\"Right now there's such a focus on punishment--most criminal justice or correctional systems are punitive in nature--that it's hard to develop effective rehabilitative programs,\" says Morgan.\n\n**Relevant research**\n\nTo help shift the focus from punishment to rehabilitation, psychologists are doing research on the causes of crime and the psychological effects of incarceration.\n\nIn the 1970s, when major changes were being made to the U.S. prison system, psychologists had little hard data to contribute.\n\nBut in the past 25 years, says Haney, they have generated a massive literature documenting the importance of child abuse, poverty, early exposure to substance abuse and other risk factors for criminal behavior. The findings suggest that individual-centered approaches to crime prevention need to be complemented by community-based approaches.\n\nResearchers have also found that the pessimistic \"nothing works\" attitude toward rehabilitation that helped justify punitive prison policies in the 1970s was overstated. When properly implemented, work programs, education and psychotherapy can ease prisoners' transitions to the free world, says Haney.\n\nFinally, researchers have demonstrated the power of the prison environment to shape behavior, often to the detriment of both prisoners and prison workers.\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment, which Haney co-authored in 1973 with Stanford University psychologist and APA Past-president Philip G. Zimbardo, PhD, is one example. It showed that psychologically healthy individuals could become sadistic or depressed when placed in a prison-like environment.\n\nMore recently, Haney has been studying so-called \"supermax\" prisons--high-security units in which prisoners spend as many as 23 hours per day in solitary confinement for years at a time.\n\nHaney's research has shown that many prisoners in supermax units experience extremely high levels of anxiety and other negative emotions. When released--often without any \"decompression\" period in lower-security facilities--they have few of the social or occupational skills necessary to succeed in the outside world.\n\nNonetheless, supermax facilities have become increasingly common over the past five to ten years.\n\n\"This is what prison systems do under emergency circumstances--they move to punitive social control mechanisms,\" explains Haney. \"\\[But\\] it's a very short-term solution, and one that may do more long-term damage both to the system and to the individuals than it solves.\"\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the research and evidence provided, it appears that rehabilitation is more effective than punishment in reducing recidivism and improving public safety. While punishment serves an important purpose, it does not address the underlying issues that lead to criminal behavior. Rehabilitation, on the other hand, focuses on transforming individuals and helping them reintegrate into society, which leads to better long-term outcomes for both the individuals and the broader community.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Prisons should focus more on rehabilitation. </answer>",

    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, Donald Trump has faced multiple accusations of racism. For instance, he made a controversial tweet suggesting that certain members of Congress should \"go back\" to their countries of origin, which was widely condemned as racist. Additionally, there are concerns regarding his policies that may disproportionately affect minority communities, such as his executive order bypassing environmental regulations which could have harmful effects on marginalized communities. Furthermore, there are numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, which, while not directly related to racism, reflect a broader pattern of behavior that some argue contributes to a culture of discrimination and hostility towards women, including women of color.

The reasons for weaponizing division are not mysterious. Racial fear prevents Americans from building community with one another — and community is the lifeblood of a functioning democratic society. Throughout our history, racist language has been used to turn American against American in order to benefit the wealthy elite. Every time Mr. Trump attacks refugees is a time that could be spent discussing the president's unwillingness to raise the federal minimum wage for up to 33 million Americans. Every racist attack on four members of Congress is a moment he doesn't have to address why his choice for labor secretary has spent his career defending Wall Street banks and Walmart at the expense of workers. When he is launching attacks on the free press, he isn't talking about why his Environmental Protection Agency just refused to ban a pesticide linked to brain damage in children.\nHis efforts to pit religious minorities against one another stem from the same playbook. If working Americans are too busy fighting with one another, we will never address the very real and deep problems our country faces — from climate change to soaring inequality to lack of quality affordable health care.\nThe only way to push back is to be unequivocal about our values. It is not enough to condemn Mr. Trump's racism. We must affirmatively confront racist policies — whether the caging of immigrant children at the border or the banning of Muslim immigrants or the allowing of segregation in public housing. It is not enough to condemn the corruption and self-dealing of this administration. We must support policies that unmistakably improve working people's lives, including by strengthening collective bargaining, raising the minimum wage and pursuing a universal jobs guarantee.\nThe consequences of this fight will not just be felt here at home but around the world. Right-wing nationalism in Hungary, Russia, France, Britain and elsewhere is on the march in ways not seen in decades. America has been a beacon of democratic ideals for the world. If we succumb to the fever of right-wing nationalism, it will have consequences far beyond our borders.\nThe proudest moments in our history — from the Emancipation Proclamation to the civil rights movement to the struggle against fascism — have come when we fight to protect and expand basic democratic rights. Today, democracy is under attack once again. It's time to respond with the kind of conviction that has made America great before.\nTo read the op-ed, click here.\nDoc 3(Title: WASHINGTON — U.S. Rep. Will Hurd called Donald Trump’s tweets “racist and xenophobic.” Pete Olson and Chip Roy were also critical, with Olson saying the president should “disavow his comments.”) But the bulk of the Texas GOP delegation has remained silent on the matter after Trump said that four Democratic women of color in Congress should “go back” to the “broken and crime infested places from which they came.” But they will likely be called to weigh in soon, with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing she’ll call a vote on a resolution condemning the president’s racist words.\nTrump made the comments on Twitter on Sunday morning, writing that the four members — U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — “who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe,” should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”\nAll four members are citizens; only Omar was born outside the country, in Somalia.\nMost of the Texas Republicans who weighed in are top offensive targets for House Democrats next year. Hurd, a Republican from Helotes, told CNN that the “tweets are racist and xenophobic. They’re also inaccurate.”\nHurd, the most frequent Trump critic among Texas congressional Republicans, further stated that the sentiment Trump expressed was “unbecoming of the leader of the free world” and suggested that comment was a distraction from an increasingly hostile civil war between the progressive members Trump referenced and Democratic leadership.\n“Now they have started circling the wagons and are trying to protect one another,” he added.\nOlson, who represents Sugar Land, tweeted that Trump’s comments “are not reflective of the values of the 1,000,000+ people in Texas 22.”\n“We are proud to be the most diverse Congressional district in America,” Olson wrote. “I urge our President immediately disavow his comments.”\nAnd Roy, a freshman Republican of Dripping Springs, jumped in as well.\n“POTUS was wrong to say any American citizen, whether in Congress or not, has any ‘home’ besides the U.S,” he wrote on Twitter. “But I just as strongly believe non-citizens who abuse our immigration laws should be sent home immediately, & Reps who refuse to defend America should be sent home 11/2020.”\nIn an interview with the Tribune on Monday afternoon, however, Roy stopped short of calling the tweets racist.\n“The entire day today I’ve been noticing everybody going around saying, ‘Well it’s this or that, the other. It is racist; it isn’t racist. It’s xenophobic; it isn’t [xenophobic],'” he said. “I’m not going to get into characterizing it. I’ve said what I said very clearly.”\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Ron Wright, R-Arlington, said in a statement that he strongly disagrees with Trump’s tweet.\n“As a conservative Republican, I disagree with these four colleagues on a great many issues, but telling them to leave the country because I disagree with them is not a solution,” Wright said. “It, in fact, invites more political acrimony.”\nU.S. Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Terrell, wrote that he interpreted the comments differently.\n“Did @realDonaldTrump suggest America isn’t the home of my colleagues who have so far made a career out of playing the race card? I don’t think so,” he wrote. “Does he mean to condemn their disparaging comments about America and anti-Semitic quips? Yes, and so do I.”\nIn a tweet, Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Houston lumped the president’s words in with progressive House members’ use of the term “concentration camp” to describe border facilities, issuing a blanket disavowal of “out of control” rhetoric. During House votes Monday evening, he said, “Everything that has come out of those women’s mouths has generally been wrong, deeply offensive. But that doesn’t mean that we stoop to that level. That doesn’t mean that we say things that are unacceptable as well.”\nAfter cas\nDoc 4(Title: Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations) Since the 1970s, at least 28 women have accused Donald Trump of various acts of sexual misconduct,[1] including rape, and kissing and groping without consent; looking under women's skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.

So why should we care about his legacy in the twenty-first century?\n\nFrom 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists triumphed in China’s civil war, until the collapse of the Berlin Wall 40 years later, Karl Marx’s historical significance was unsurpassed. Nearly four of every ten people on earth lived under governments that claimed to be Marxist, and in many other countries Marxism was the dominant ideology of the left, while the policies of the right were often based on how to counter Marxism.[1](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nOnce communism collapsed in the Soviet Union and its satellites, however, Marx’s influence plummeted. On the 200th anniversary of Marx’s birth on May 5, 1818, it isn’t far-fetched to suggest that his predictions have been falsified, his theories discredited, and his ideas rendered obsolete. So why should we care about his legacy in the twenty-first century?[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nMarx’s reputation was severely damaged by the atrocities committed by regimes that called themselves Marxist, although there is no evidence that Marx himself would have supported such crimes. But communism collapsed largely because, as practiced in the Soviet bloc and in China under Mao, it failed to provide people with a standard of living that could compete with that of most people in the capitalist economies.\n\nThese failures do not reflect flaws in Marx’s depiction of communism, because Marx never depicted it: he showed not the slightest interest in the details of how a communist society would function. Instead, the failures of communism point to a deeper flaw: Marx’s false view of human nature.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nThere is, Marx thought, no such thing as an inherent or biological human nature. The human essence is, he wrote in his Theses on Feuerbach, “the ensemble of the social relations.” It follows then, that if you change the social relations – for example, by changing the economic basis of society and abolishing the relationship between capitalist and worker – people in the new society will be very different from the way they were under capitalism.\n\n[![Image 1: ](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/BaTfOSiy1DpI-rwFF_3rlAkLI3WunGXoPladHER6ImY.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx#/media/File:Marx3.jpg)\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\nMarx did not arrive at this conviction through detailed studies of human nature under different economic systems. It was, rather, an application of Hegel’s view of history. According to Hegel, the goal of history is the liberation of the human spirit, which will occur when we all understand that we are part of a universal human mind. Marx transformed this “idealist” account into a “materialist” one, in which the driving force of history is the satisfaction of our material needs, and liberation is achieved by class struggle. The working class will be the means to universal liberation because it is the negation of private property, and hence will usher in collective ownership of the means of production.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nOnce workers owned the means of production collectively, Marx thought, the “springs of cooperative wealth” would flow more abundantly than those of private wealth – so abundantly, in fact, that distribution would cease to be a problem. That is why he saw no need to go into detail about how income or goods would be distributed. In fact, when Marx read a proposed platform for a merger of two German socialist parties, he described ph\nDoc 2(Title: What is Karl Marx's legacy 200 years on from his birth?) \nthan those of private wealth – so abundantly, in fact, that distribution would cease to be a problem. That is why he saw no need to go into detail about how income or goods would be distributed. In fact, when Marx read a proposed platform for a merger of two German socialist parties, he described phrases like “fair distribution” and “equal right” as “obsolete verbal rubbish.” They belonged, he thought, to an era of scarcity that the revolution would bring to an end.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nThe Soviet Union proved that abolishing private ownership of the means of production does not change human nature. Most humans, instead of devoting themselves to the common good, continue to seek power, privilege, and luxury for themselves and those close to them. Ironically, the clearest demonstration that the springs of private wealth flow more abundantly than those of collective wealth can be seen in the history of the one major country that still proclaims its adherence to Marxism.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nUnder Mao, most Chinese lived in poverty. China’s economy started to grow rapidly only after 1978, when Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping (who had proclaimed that, “It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice”) allowed private enterprises to be established. Deng’s reforms eventually lifted 800 million people out of extreme poverty, but also created a society with greater income inequality than any European country (and much greater than the United States). Although China still proclaims that it is building “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” it is not easy to see what is socialist, let alone Marxist, about its economy.[5](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\n##### Have you read?\n\n*   ##### [It isn't social media that's shielding you from different political views.

Yet his intellectual influence remains. His materialist theory of history has, in an attenuated form, become part of our understanding of the forces that determine the direction of human society. We do not have to believe that, as Marx once incautiously put it, the hand-mill gives us a society with feudal lords, and the steam-mill a society with industrial capitalists. In other writings, Marx suggested a more complex view, in which there is interaction among all aspects of society.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nThe most important takeaway from Marx’s view of history is negative: the evolution of ideas, religions, and political institutions is not independent of the tools we use to satisfy our needs, nor of the economic structures we organize around those tools, and the financial interests they create. If this seems too obvious to need stating, it is because we have internalized this view. In that sense, we are all Marxists now.\n\nDoc 3(Title: rld such as Rosa Luxemburg,[296] Bhagat Singh,[297] Ernst Thälmann, Che Guevara,[298] Chandra Shekhar Azad, Antonio Gramsci and Fred Hampton[299] were deeply influenced by Marxist ideology.)

He is best-known for the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto (written with Friedrich Engels), and his three-volume Das Kapital (1867–1894), a critique of classical political economy which employs his theory of historical materialism in an analysis of capitalism, in the culmination of his life's work. Marx's ideas and their subsequent development, collectively known as Marxism, have had enormous influence.\nBorn in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia, Marx studied at the University of Bonn and the University of Berlin, and received a doctoral degree in philosophy from the University of Jena in 1841. A Young Hegelian, he was influenced by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and both critiqued and developed Hegel's ideas in works such as The German Ideology (written 1846) and the Grundrisse (written 1857–1858). While in Paris, Marx wrote his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and met Engels, who became his closest friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845, they were active in the Communist League, and in 1848 they wrote The Communist Manifesto, which expresses Marx's ideas and lays out a programme for revolution. Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany, and in 1849 moved to London, where he wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852) and Das Kapital. From 1864, Marx was involved in the International Workingmen's Association (First International), in which he fought the influence of anarchists led by Mikhail Bakunin. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875), Marx wrote on revolution, the state and the transition to communism. He died stateless in 1883 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.\nMarx's critiques of history, society and political economy hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power for wages.[4] Employing his historical materialist approach, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism—owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature—would eventuate the working class's development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers.[5] Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.[6]\nMarx has been described as one of the most influential figures of the modern era, and his work has been both lauded and criticised.[7] Marxism has exerted major influence on socialist thought and political movements, with Marxist schools of thought such as Marxism–Leninism and its offshoots becoming the guiding ideologies of revolutions that took power in many countries during the 20th century, forming communist states. Marx's work in economics has had a strong influence on modern heterodox theories of labour and capital,[8][9][10] and he is often cited as one of the principal architects of modern sociology.[11][12]\nBiography\nChildhood and early education: 1818–1836\nKarl Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to Heinrich Marx and Henriette Pressburg, at Brückengasse 664 in Trier, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia.[15] Marx's family was originally non-religious Jewish but had converted formally to Christianity before his birth. His maternal grandfather\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, Karl Marx's legacy can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Economic and Political Theory**: Marx's theories, particularly those presented in \"Das Kapital\" and \"The Communist Manifesto,\" continue to influence discussions and debates on economics, political science, and sociology. His ideas about class struggle and the critique of capitalism remain relevant in academic circles and political discourse.\n\n2. **Cultural Impact**: Marx's life and works have been extensively documented in various forms of media, including films and documentaries, which continue to explore his life and ideas. This cultural representation keeps his name and concepts alive in popular culture.\n\n3. **Political Movements**: Although the direct implementation of Marxist states has declined, his ideas continue to influence socialist and communist movements worldwide. His theories on class struggle and the potential for a classless society remain central to these ideologies.\n\n4. **Academic Influence**: Marx's work has had a significant impact on the development of modern sociology, economics, and political science. His methods of analysis and his theories on historical materialism are still studied and debated in universities globally.\n\n5. **Memorial and Commemoration**: There are ongoing efforts to commemorate Marx, such as the unveiling of statues and the inclusion of his writings in cultural heritage lists. This shows a continued interest in his legacy and ideas.\n\nIn summary, while the direct influence of Marxist states has waned, Karl Marx's theoretical contributions continue to shape contemporary discussions and movements in various fields. His ideas remain relevant and are frequently referenced in academic, political, and cultural contexts.\n<answer> Karl Marx's legacy includes his influential economic and political theories, cultural impact through media representations, ongoing influence on political movements, academic contributions to fields such as sociology and economics, and continued commemoration and study of his works. </answer>",

Of the remaining 35% only 11% would have voted Trump, the rest were undecided.\n\nBut Clinton had the highest backing in the Nordic regions, with levels of support ranging from 72% in Norway to a high of 81% in Denmark, and relatively few undecided.\n\nOther European countries weren’t far behind, almost three quarters of Germans (72%) thought Clinton would make a better president, while 64% of the French agreed.\n\n![Image 1: Who would you rather was president of the USA? %  ](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/mWOx6YRlZnnwxS0ug8Dll64I0pMzSKmRu30XNNmM-Wc.JPG)\n\nImage: YouGov\n\n**Where did Trump have the most support?**\n\nThe real election result is reflected in the results of the survey, which showed the highest support for Trump in the US, at 39%, more than any other country.\n\nOne-fifth of those in Thailand and India were also in favour of a Trump presidency, but with far less support he has in America.

YouGov surveyed 20,000 adults in every G20 country and found that Russia was the only nation that preferred Trump.\n\nAnd by a long way.

Two other items also showed a 3-point difference on one of the response options. In the balanced version, 54% said that it was a bigger problem for the country that people did not see racism that was occurring, compared with 57% among the tilted version. Similarly, in the balanced version, 38% said that the U.S. had controlled the coronavirus outbreak “as much as it could have,” compared with 35% who said this in the tilted version. All other questions tested showed smaller differences.) Opinion questions on issues that have been at the core of partisan divisions in U.S. politics tended to be the only ones that showed any difference between the balanced version and the tilted version. Preference for smaller versus bigger government, a fundamental dividing line between the parties, differed by 2 points between the versions. Perceptions of the impact of immigration on the country, a core issue for Donald Trump, also varied by 2 points between the two versions. The belief that human activity contributes “a great deal” to global climate change was 2 points higher in the tilted version. The share of Americans saying that government should do more to help the needy was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version.\nDespite the fact that news audiences are quite polarized politically, there were typically only small differences between the two versions in how many people have been relying on particular sources for news in the aftermath of the presidential election. The share of people who said that CNN had been a major source of news about the presidential election in the period after Election Day was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version, while the share who cited Fox News as a major source was 1 point higher in the balanced version than the tilted version.\nThe complete set of comparisons among the 48 survey questions are shown in the topline at the end of this report.\nWhy don’t big differences in candidate preference and party affiliation result in big differences in opinions on issues?\nOpinions on issues and government policies are strongly, but not perfectly, correlated with partisanship and candidate preference. A minority of people who support each candidate do not hold views that are consistent with what their candidate or party favors. Among nonvoters, support among partisans for their party’s traditional positions – especially among Republicans – is even weaker. This fact lessens the impact of changing the balance of candidate support and party affiliation in a poll.\nThere’s almost never a one-to-one correspondence between the share of voters for a candidate and the share of people holding a particular opinion that aligns with the opinion of that candidate’s party. Three examples from a summer 2020 survey illustrate the point.\nAsked whether they favor a larger government providing more services or a smaller government providing fewer services, nearly one-fourth of Biden’s supporters (23%) opted for smaller government, a position not usually associated with Democrats or Democratic candidates. On a question about whether the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens American values or strengthens its society, nearly one-third of Trump’s supporters (31%) take the pro-immigrant view, despite the fact that the Trump administration took a number of steps to limit both legal and illegal immigration. And about one-fourth of Trump’s supporters (24%) say that it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, hardly a standard Republican Party position.\nShifting the focus to party affiliation among nonvoters, we see even less fidelity of partisans to issue positions typically associated with those parties. For examp\nDoc 4(Title: rategy is a massive gamble. On its face it seems like a weird mistake, coming from an accomplished salesman who knows that the customer is always right. The last time Americans elected someone who had never held elected office before, they went with Dwight Eisenhower, a man who entered the race with high name recognition thanks to his role as supreme commander of the Allied Forces during World War II. Trump starred on “The Apprentice.” But anything is possible, so Democrats have to take the threat that he could be elected president — thanks to a wave of support from white men — seriously. “The white male vote is going to decide the race,” John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock, Pa. said. “If Trump can pull Reagan voters, he’s going to win. And we can’t let that happen.”) The Clinton camp is prepared for a grueling general election. In an interview with PBS NewsHour the day after she clinched the Democratic nomination, Clinton said she plans to ignore Trump’s personal attacks against her. But Trump is “attempting to drive wedges between and among Americans,” Clinton added, “and I am not going to stand by and be silent as he tries to do that.” Earlier this year, Priorities USA Action, the main Super PAC backing Clinton, and other organizations began running ads highlighting Trump’s sexist rhetoric. “That will be a continuing part of the race,” said Geoff Garin, a pollster at Priorities USA who served as Clinton’s chief strategist in the final months of her 2008 run for the White House.\nPredicting presidential elections is a fraught enterprise. One of the best models belongs to Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. His research shows that the three deciding factors are a sitting president’s approval rating in the summer months before an election; second-quarter economic growth in an election year; and how many terms the party in power has been in the White House. By those standards, Clinton is in good but not great shape right now. But unforeseen forces exist that can sometimes upend the best prediction models, and Trump is the very definition of an unforeseen force.\nAs Donald Rumsfeld famously said, “there are known knowns,” “known unknowns,” and “unknown unknowns.” Hillary Clinton is a known entity. And it’s clear that Trump needs to outperform Romney by a lot with white men to make up for his historically low level of support from women and non-white voters. Most of his votes will come from Republicans. But Trump is going to make a gendered appeal to independent and Democratic white men as well, and it’s impossible to predict how that will go. We’ve never had a woman at the top of a Democratic or Republican ticket before. Gender is the great known unknown of the 2016 election.\nTo some, the choice between a former first lady, senator and secretary of state and a real estate developer-turned-reality T.V. star will feel like a no-brainer. But for others it won’t be that easy. They’ll have doubts and fears, if they don’t already. They’ll be concerned about Clinton’s policies, her personality, her email server and paid speeches on Wall Street. In the end, a certain percentage of white men aren’t going to vote for Clinton in November, and if it’s a large enough number Clinton is going to lose. And some of those men will not vote for Clinton simply because she’s a woman, though they may not acknowledge that to pollsters or even themselves.\nSign up for the PBS NewsHour Politics Newsletter\nReceive political analysis on Friday from Mark Shields and David Brooks and on Monday from Amy Walter and Tamara Keith.

McKelvey’s father is a steel mill worker, and his mother is an accountant. He was an offensive lineman on his high school football team, and moves with the gracefulness of a former athlete. McKelvey, who is white, described himself as a moderate Republican. He disagrees with Trump’s most inflammatory proposals, such as banning Muslim immigrants from entering the country. Still, he voted for Trump in the primary and is planning to back him again in the general election. He fits into Trump’s target demographic. If enough people like Tomi McKelvey vote for Trump, he has a real shot.) McKelvey told me he didn’t like or trust Clinton. He said he wants a woman to become president someday, but didn’t think that Clinton was the “right one.”\n“I’m not a real Hillary fan, but I respect her,” McKelvey said.\nWhen I asked him at another point if he viewed male and female roles in society any differently, McKelvey replied, “With a man you look for leadership and guidance. With a woman you look for companionship and nurturing. A motherly role.”\nMcKelvey isn’t unique in thinking this way. Many Americans have been conditioned to assign men and women prescribed gender roles. And when Clinton goes off-script, which she did a long time ago, and acts like a politician — that is to say, no different than a man — science shows that McKelvey and the rest of us are wired to judge her differently, and more negatively, than her male competition. That’s the double standard at work, and that’s the point. It is very real, and it has a profound effect on our view of men, women, and who gets to have the power.\nThe Iowa Democratic caucuses were a turning point in 2008. Barack Obama’s surprise victory signaled that whites would vote for a black candidate, instantly turning him into a true contender. But in 2016, Clinton had to wait much longer (until the end of the primaries) for her version of an “Iowa” moment — a primary win or key speech that the country interpreted as a critical shift in gender relations. Like Obama, Clinton also made history in Iowa, but her win didn’t symbolize a decisive change in how men view female politicians. The exit polls and Sanders’ improbably close second-place finish told the opposite story. Clinton won with women and non-white voters. But she lost the male vote in Iowa by 14 points.\nAn overtly gendered narrative emerged, pitting Sanders’ inspiring political “revolution” against Clinton’s plodding, eat-your-vegetables “march” to the nomination.\nIowa set the pattern for the rest of the primaries. An overtly gendered narrative emerged, pitting Sanders’ inspiring political “revolution” against Clinton’s plodding, eat-your-vegetables “march” to the nomination. There were times when Clinton allowed herself to stop and enjoy the moment. On the night of her landslide win in South Carolina in late February, Clinton took the stage at a college gym in downtown Columbia looking visibly relieved. The results made clear that Clinton would win big with minority voters, and build an insurmountable delegate lead. Super Tuesday was still one week away, but at that point her Democratic primary battle with Sanders was effectively over.\nThe atmosphere at her South Carolina primary night rally was celebratory. But the win represented a bittersweet tradeoff for advocates of gender equality, regardless of their political affiliation. Yes, Clinton was going to win the nomination, but largely because women and non-white voters were supporting her candidacy. White men appeared much more comfortable voting for Sanders.\nThat’s exactly what ended up happening. In the months that followed, Clinton won diverse states and Sanders carried predominantly white ones. The racial divide was startling. During one stretch in late March and early April, when Sanders won seven consecutive contests, the Democratic electorate in the states that he carried was on average 72 percent wh\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it appears that Hillary Clinton has stronger support globally, with a significant majority of international respondents preferring her over Donald Trump.

    "question": "Should the U.S. become socialist?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it seems that the U.S. public generally views socialism with caution and skepticism, with more positive views among Democrats and younger individuals. However, it is crucial to note that the concept of socialism can vary widely, from state socialism to libertarian socialism and beyond. Implementing socialism in the U.S. would likely face significant challenges due to cultural, historical, and economic factors. The public's perception and the practical implementation of socialism would be key considerations. Given the current climate and public opinion, a gradual shift towards more socialist policies, rather than an abrupt transformation, might be more feasible. However, the ultimate decision on whether the U.S. should become socialist would depend on a comprehensive evaluation of the potential benefits and drawbacks, as well as the specific form of socialism proposed.",

For this analysis, we surveyed 7,647 adults from Aug. 1-14, 2022. The survey was primarily conducted on the Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel, with an oversample of Hispanic adults from Ipsos’ KnowledgePanel.) Respondents on both panels are recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. See the Methodology section for additional details. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.\nHere are the questions used for the report and its methodology.\nThe American public continues to express more positive opinions of “capitalism” than “socialism,” although the shares viewing each of the terms positively have declined modestly since 2019.\nToday, 36% of U.S. adults say they view socialism somewhat (30%) or very (6%) positively, down from 42% who viewed the term positively in May 2019. Six-in-ten today say they view socialism negatively, including one-third who view it very negatively.\nAnd while a majority of the public (57%) continues to view capitalism favorably, that is 8 percentage points lower than in 2019 (65%), according to a national survey from Pew Research Center conducted Aug. 1-14 among 7,647 adults.\nMuch of the decline in positive views of both socialism and capitalism has been driven by shifts in views among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.\nIn 2019, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic leaners (65%) had a positive view of socialism. Today a smaller majority of Democrats (57%) say they have a positive impression.\nThere has not been significant change among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents since 2019. Today, just 14% say they have a positive impression of socialism, while about four times as many say they have a very negative view of the term.\nThere is a similar pattern on views of capitalism. Today, fewer than half of Democrats (46%) have a positive view of capitalism, down 9 points from the 55% who said this in 2019.\nAmong Republicans, there has been a modest decline in the share who have positive views of capitalism, although a large majority still have a positive impression (78% in 2019, 74% today).\nAmericans see capitalism as giving people more opportunity and more freedom than socialism, while they see socialism as more likely to meet people’s basic needs, though these perceptions differ significantly by party.\nWhile 36% of adults say “gives all people an equal opportunity to be successful” describes capitalism extremely or very well, fewer (23%) say that about socialism. And roughly twice as many say the phrase “makes sure everyone’s basic needs, such as food, health care, and housing, are met” describes socialism at least very well as say the same of capitalism (38% vs. 18%).\nConsistent with the wide partisan differences in opinions of socialism and capitalism, Republicans and Democrats characterize the terms in very different ways. For example, Republicans widely think socialism “restricts people’s individual freedoms” – 62% say this describes socialism extremely or very well, compared with 19% of Democrats. Democrats, by contrast, are far more likely than Republicans to say socialism meets people’s basic needs (56% extremely or very well vs. 19% of Republicans).\nThese differences echo findings from Americans’ open-ended descriptions of the terms in the 2019 study, which found that critics of socialism were more likely to mention stifled innovation and restrictions of freedom in their responses and to cite countries like Venezuela as examples. Those with a positive view of socialism were more likely to describe it as a fairer system – and to mention countries like Finland and Denmark as examples.\nDemocrats and Republicans \nDoc 2(Title: thoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement. University of California Press. p. 1. ISBN 978-0520075436.) 'We are not among those communists who are out to destroy personal liberty, who wish to turn the world into one huge barrack or into a gigantic workhouse. There certainly are some communists who, with an easy conscience, refuse to countenance personal liberty and would like to shuffle it out of the world because they consider that it is a hindrance to complete harmony. But we have no desire to exchange freedom for equality. We are convinced ... that in no social order will freedom be assured as in a society based upon communal ownership.' Thus wrote the editors of the Journal of the Communist League in 1847, under the direct influence of the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.\n- ^ \"Где находится Екатериненштадт?

Put freedom, liberty, patriotism, and other political buzz words on whatever you’re trying to sell and gullible people will buy it without a taking a second to even consider what they are actually being sold. As John Steinbeck (or Ronald Wright) said (it’s a disputed quote), “Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.” People seem to be okay being slaves so long as they believe there is a chance they can become slave owners if they “work hard enough” but it’s not true. You can work as hard as you want but if you weren’t afforded major advantages like a large inheritance or a father with a monopoly, you will likely never become one of those masters. People have to stop wanting to be a part of the bourgeoisie 1% we are supposed to be fighting. If you read the writings of real anarchists like Mikhail Bakunin, (who also warned us about the potential for “Red Terror” and an oppressive, pseudo “People’s state” Marxism would bring) James Guillaume, Nestor Makhno, Kropotkin, Camillo Berneri, Emma Goldman, and Adhémar Schwitzguébel, you will see they say there is no anarchy without abolishing wage slavery and freeing ourselves from our economic masters who have far more power than politicians. Anarchism evolved in tandem with many revoluntionary, socialist movements and that is the reason.) Why do ancaps believe market competition is the solution to everything? The more competition there is in the marketplace, the more incentive there is for lower wages, worse working conditions, more unethical practices, and so on as it becomes harder and harder to make a profit. Not everything in this world should have a price tag! I don’t know why that’s not obvious to everyone. Cooperation, collaboration, and collective ownership are much more conducive to productivity, innovation, and well-being in our economic, social, and environmental spheres. This doesn’t mean we should revert to communism. Due to Western propaganda, much of the West believes there is some dichotomy between capitalism and communism. But that is absurd. There are an infinite number of ways economies can run that are a far cry from either system. Communism involves the state (taking over that power and using it) and we have seen the disasterous dictatorships like the Soviet Union who have used “communism” as a justification for their despotism. Barter, resource based economies, gift economies, and cryptocurrencies work infinitely better. Elements of libertarian socialism (NOT state socialism) are also useful as they promote collective ownership of the means of production and distribution by need, as opposed to greed.\nPoliticians are just figure heads or puppets for the super rich. The people with the real power are the super rich like the Rothschilds who print money that they then lend to the government, so that the people are perpetually “in debt” to them. The regulations sensible people want on corporations don’t impede “mom and pop” small businesses. These regulations target the exploitative and ecocidal practices of mutlibillion dollar corporations. The only reason anyone should not want those regulations is because they profit from these corporations or they aspire to. And these types of regulations don’t require governments to enforce them so there’s nothing statist about wanting to reign in these massive, destructive corporations. These corporations would be put in check without governments. The starving populace wouldn’t put up with billionaires and their ridiculous bourgeois lifestyles if it wasn’t illegal to take their ill-gotten riches. To think less government regulations on corporations are the answer to our woes is beyond naive; It is incredibly dangerous. The banks robbed our economy and the American government bailed them out with $700 billion of taxpayer money.

Only about a third of Democrats with a negative impression of socialism (34%) say the same.\nConversely, Democrats with a negative impression of socialism are more likely to say that socialism restricts people’s individual’s freedoms. Roughly three-in-ten (29%) say this, compared with just 12% of Democrats who have a positive impression of socialism.\nDemocrats’ views of leaders who identify as democratic socialists\nOverall, a third of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they like political leaders who identify as democratic socialists, while 18% dislike such leaders, a separate Pew Research Center survey conducted June 27-July 4 found. Nearly half of Democrats (47%) say they neither like nor dislike political leaders who call themselves democratic socialists. These shares are essentially unchanged over the past year.\nAmong Democrats, ideology and age are both closely associated with views of political leaders who identify as democratic socialists. This mirrors the pattern of opinion on the term “socialism” – with younger Democrats and liberal Democrats more positive about both democratic socialists and the overall term “socialism” than older Democrats and conservative or moderate Democrats.\nHalf of liberal Democrats express favorable views of those who identify as democratic socialists, including 26% who like such leaders “a lot.” Only about one-in-ten liberal Democrats (12%) say they dislike leaders who say they are democratic socialists, while another 38% neither like nor dislike such leaders.\nBy contrast, conservative or moderate Democrats are somewhat more likely to say they dislike (24%) than like (19%) such leaders; 55% neither like nor dislike leaders who use this term to describe themselves.\nOn balance, younger Democrats like leaders who describe themselves as democratic socialists: Among those under 50, 37% like such leaders while 15% dislike them. By comparison, opinion of democratic socialists is more divided among those 50 and older: 28% like political leaders who identify as democratic socialists, while 22% dislike such leaders.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that the U.S. public generally views socialism with caution and skepticism, with more positive views among Democrats and younger individuals.

    "question": "When will we get rid of religion?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, the complete disappearance of religion seems unlikely. However, the scenarios suggest that the percentage of Christians in the U.S. could decrease significantly over the next 50 years. Under the scenario where switching continues at recent rates, Christians would decline from 64% to between 35% and 54% of the population by 2070. In the scenario where switching accelerates, Christians could fall below 35% by 2070. Even if switching were to stop, Christians would still decline from 64% to 35% by 2070. Therefore, while religion may become less prominent in the future, it is unlikely to disappear completely in the near term. </think>\n\n<answer> No, religion is unlikely to completely disappear in the near term. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> The phrase \"get rid of religion\" is quite broad and complex. It could refer to the decline in religious belief or practice within a society, or the complete eradication of religious influence. Religion has been a fundamental part of human societies for thousands of years, so its complete disappearance seems unlikely. I should search for more specific information on this topic.</think>\n\n<search> when will we get rid of religion </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: This report seeks to answer the question: What might the religious makeup of the United States look like roughly 50 years from now, in 2070, if recent trends continue? We try to address this not with sweeping predictions or grand theories, but with mathematical projections that combine techniques standardly used in demography (the study of human populations) with data we have collected in surveys on religion.) Demographers project the growth or shrinkage of populations based on factors such as age, sex, fertility, mortality and migration. For religious populations, projections also need to include data on “switching” – voluntary movement into and out of religious groups. Finally, the shifting sizes of U.S. religious groups depend partly on rates of religious transmission – whether parents pass their religious identity on to their children. In this report, Pew Research Center has incorporated estimates of “intergenerational transmission of religion” into our projections for the first time.\nSwitching rates are estimated based on responses from more than 15,000 adults to two questions posed in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey: “In what religion, if any, were you raised?” and “What is your present religion, if any?” Results were weighted to the Center’s National Public Opinion Reference Survey, conducted by mail and online in 2020. Long-term cohort trends in switching (going back to the 1970s) come from two similar questions in the long-running General Social Survey: “In what religion were you raised?” and “What is your religious preference?”\nShifts in religious identity, or switching, are concentrated among young adults. During earlier childhood years, a parent’s religion (or lack thereof) is often, but not always, transmitted to a child. Rates of transmission for three identity categories (Christian, other religion, and religiously unaffiliated) are estimated based on the percentages of teens (ages 13 to 17) who shared their mother’s religious affiliation in a 2019 survey of 1,811 pairs of U.S. parents and teens. These observed patterns are used to model whether future generations of newborn children inherit their mother’s religion.\nGroup differences in fertility (the number of children women tend to have), migration and age structures also drive change. Fertility differences by religion are based on the National Survey of Family Growth, while the average U.S. fertility rate used in each period is based on the 2019 revision of United Nations World Populations Prospect data. Migration data comes from the UN. Religious composition by age and sex groups is based on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel. We estimate the religious composition of children based on the religious composition of young adults, and fertility patterns.\nThe various input data is used in projection models to illustrate what the future religious composition of the U.S. might look like under a range of hypothetical scenarios. See Methodology for more information on inputs and modeling.\nSince the 1990s, large numbers of Americans have left Christianity to join the growing ranks of U.S. adults who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular.” This accelerating trend is reshaping the U.S. religious landscape, leading many people to wonder what the future of religion in America might look like.\nWhat if Christians keep leaving religion at the same rate observed in recent years? What if the pace of religious switching continues to accelerate? What if switching were to stop, but other demographic trends – such as migration, births and deaths – were to continue at current rates? To help answer such questions, Pew Research Center has modeled several hypothetical scenarios describing how the U.S. religious landscape might change over the next half century.\nThe Center estimates that in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones,” acc\nDoc 2(Title:  modeled several hypothetical scenarios describing how the U.S. religious landscape might change over the next half century.) The Center estimates that in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones,” accounted for 30% of the U.S. population. Adherents of all other religions – including Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists – totaled about 6%.1\nDepending on whether religious switching continues at recent rates, speeds up or stops entirely, the projections show Christians of all ages shrinking from 64% to between a little more than half (54%) and just above one-third (35%) of all Americans by 2070. Over that same period, “nones” would rise from the current 30% to somewhere between 34% and 52% of the U.S. population.\nSwitching, which in some cases could be described as religious conversion, is defined in this report as a change between the religion in which a person was raised (in childhood) and their present religious identity (in adulthood).\nCurrent rates of switching are based on responses from more than 15,000 adults to two questions posed in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey: “In what religion, if any, were you raised?” and “What is your present religion, if any?”\nIn many cases, switching does not happen in a single moment. Religious “nones” often describe their disaffiliation as a gradual process, and some may never have felt a strong connection to a religious identity, even though they describe themselves as having been raised in a faith tradition.\nHowever, these are not the only possibilities, and they are not meant as predictions of what will happen. Rather, this study presents formal demographic projections of what could happen under a few illustrative scenarios based on trends revealed by decades of survey data from Pew Research Center and the long-running General Social Survey.\nAll the projections start from the current religious composition of the U.S. population, taking account of religious differences by age and sex. Then, they factor in birth rates and migration patterns. Most importantly, they incorporate varying rates of religious switching – movement into and out of broad categories of religious identity – to model what the U.S. religious landscape would look like if switching stayed at its recent pace, continued to speed up (as it has been doing since the 1990s), or suddenly halted.\nSwitching rates are based on patterns observed in recent decades, through 2019. For example, we estimate that 31% of people raised Christian become unaffiliated between ages 15 to 29, the tumultuous period in which religious switching is concentrated.2 An additional 7% of people raised Christian become unaffiliated later in life, after the age of 30.\nWhile the scenarios in this report vary in the extent of religious disaffiliation they project, they all show Christians continuing to shrink as a share of the U.S. population, even under the counterfactual assumption that all switching came to a complete stop in 2020. At the same time, the unaffiliated are projected to grow under all four scenarios.\nUnder each of the four scenarios, people of non-Christian religions would grow to represent 12%-13% of the population – double their present share. This consistency does not imply more certainty or precision compared with projections for Christians and “nones.” Rather, the growth of other religions is likely to hinge on the future of migration (rather than religious switching), and migration patterns are held constant across all four scenarios. (See Chapter 2 for an alternative scenario involving migration.)\nOf course, it is possible that events outside the study’s model – such as war, economic depression, climate crisis, changing immigration patterns or religious innovations – could reverse current religious switching trends, leading to a revival of Christianity in the United States. But there are no current switching patterns in the U.S. that c\nDoc 3(Title: th taken over the last 50 years by many countries in Western Europe that had overwhelming Christian majorities in the middle of the 20th century and no longer do. In Great Britain, for example, “nones” surpassed Christians to become the largest group in 2009, according to the British Social Attitudes Survey.5 In the Netherlands, disaffiliation accelerated in the 1970s, and 47% of adults now say they are Christian.) While the change in affiliation rates in the United States is largely due to people voluntarily leaving religion behind, switching is not the only driver of religious composition change worldwide. For example, differences in fertility rates explain most of the recent religious change in India, while migration has altered the religious composition of many European countries in the last century. Forced conversions, mass expulsions, wars and genocides also have caused changes in religious composition throughout history.\nMoreover, the scenarios in this report are limited to religious identity and do not project how religious beliefs and practices might change in the coming decades.\nAlong with the decline in the percentage of U.S. adults who identify as Christian in recent years, Pew Research Center surveys have found declining shares of the population who say they pray daily or consider religion very important in their lives. Still, it is an open question whether the Christian population in the future will be more or less highly committed than U.S. Christians are today.\nOn the one hand, within each generation, Christians with lower levels of religious commitment may be most likely to shed their identity and become religiously unaffiliated, while new converts may bring greater zeal. These dynamics could lead to rising levels of commitment in the remaining Christian population. On the other hand, religious commitment could steadily weaken from generation to generation if people continue to identify as Christian but are less devout than their parents and grandparents. This dynamic could lead to steady or declining levels of belief and practice.\nMeanwhile, religiously unaffiliated Americans today are not uniformly nonbelieving or nonpracticing. Many religious “nones” partake in traditional religious practices despite their lack of religious identity, including a solid majority who believe in some kind of higher power or spiritual force. It is also unclear how this may change in the future, and whether connections to these beliefs will weaken if disaffiliation becomes even more common in the broader society. At the same time, many observers have wondered what kinds of spiritual practices, if any, may fill the void left by institutional religion. We plan to continue exploring this question in future research.\nThis report marks the first time Pew Research Center has projected religious composition in the United States under multiple switching scenarios, and the first time that differing rates of religious transmission from parents to children have been taken into account.\nThese population projections were produced as part of the Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures project, which analyzes religious change and its impact on societies around the world. Funding for the Global Religious Futures project comes from The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John Templeton Foundation.\nDoc 4(Title: s held constant here. These additional projections show how the U.S. religious landscape might change if current switching patterns held steady, but intergenerational religious transmission occurred in 100% of cases; there were no fertility differences by religion; there was no switching after age 30; or there was no migration after 2020.) The alternative scenarios are intended to help isolate – and thereby illuminate – the impact of various factors. One might think of the projections as an experiment in which some key drivers of religious composition change are turned on or off, sped up or slowed down, to see how much difference they make. For more information about modeling assumptions and results, see Chapter 2 and the Methodology.\nScenario 1: Steady switching – Christians would lose their majority but would still be the largest U.S. religious group in 2070\nSwitching assumption: Switching into and out of Christianity, other religions and the religiously unaffiliated category (“nones”) continues among young Americans (ages 15 to 29) at the same rates as in recent years. Most significantly, each new generation sees 31% of people who were raised Christian become religiously unaffiliated by the time they reach 30, while 21% of those who grew up with no religion become Christian.\nOutcome: If switching among young Americans continued at recent rates, Christians would decline as a share of the population by a few percentage points per decade, dipping below 50% by 2060. In 2070, 46% of Americans would identify as Christian, making Christianity a plurality – the most common religious identity – but no longer a majority. In this scenario, the share of “nones” would not climb above 41% by 2070.\nScenario 2: Rising disaffiliation with limits – ‘nones’ would be the largest group in 2070 but not a majority\nSwitching assumption: Continuing a recent pattern, switching out of Christianity becomes more common among young Americans as each generation sees a progressively larger share of Christians leave religion by the age of 30. However, brakes are applied to keep Christian retention (the share of people raised as Christians who remain Christian) from falling below about 50%.3 At the same time, switching into Christianity becomes less and less common, also continuing recent trends.\nOutcome: If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up initially but then hold steady, Christians would lose their majority status by 2050, when they would be 47% of the U.S. population (versus 42% for the unaffiliated). In 2070, “nones” would constitute a plurality of 48%, and Christians would account for 39% of Americans.\nScenario 3: Rising disaffiliation without limits – ‘nones’ would form a slim majority in 2070\nSwitching assumption: The share of Christians who disaffiliate by the time they reach 30 continues to rise with each successive generation, and rates of disaffiliation are allowed to continue rising even after Christian retention drops below 50% (i.e., no limit is imposed). As in Scenario 2, switching into Christianity among young Americans becomes less and less common.\nOutcome: If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up throughout the projection period without any brakes, Christians would no longer be a majority by 2045. By 2055, the unaffiliated would make up the largest group (46%), ahead of Christians (43%). In 2070, 52% of Americans would be unaffiliated, while a little more than a third (35%) would be Christian.\nScenario 4: No switching – Christians would retain their majority through 2070\nSwitching assumption: This scenario imagines no person in America has changed or will change their religion after 2020. But even in that hypothetical situation, the religious makeup of the U.S. population would continue to shift gradually, primarily as a result of Christians being older than other groups, on average, and the unaffiliated being younger, with a larger share of their population of childbearing age.\nOutcome: If sw\nDoc 5(Title: e the study’s model – such as war, economic depression, climate crisis, changing immigration patterns or religious innovations – could reverse current religious switching trends, leading to a revival of Christianity in the United States. But there are no current switching patterns in the U.S. that can be factored into the mathematical models to project such a result.) None of these hypothetical scenarios is certain to unfold exactly as modeled, but collectively they demonstrate how much impact switching could have on the overall population’s religious composition within a few decades. The four main scenarios, combined with four alternatives outlined in Chapter 2, show that rates of religious switching in adulthood appear to have a far greater impact on the overall religious composition of the United States than other factors that can drive changes in affiliation over time, such as fertility rates and intergenerational transmission (i.e., how many parents pass their religion to their children).\nThe decline of Christianity and the rise of the “nones” may have complex causes and far-reaching consequences for politics, family life and civil society. However, theories about the root causes of religious change and speculation about its societal impact are not the focus of this report. The main contribution of this study is to analyze recent trends and show how the U.S. religious landscape would shift if they continued.\nThis report focuses on Christians and the religiously unaffiliated, the two most common, very broad religious identities in the United States today. People with all other religious affiliations are combined into an umbrella category that includes Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and a diverse array of smaller groups that together make up about 6% of the U.S. population. In 2015, Pew Research Center projected the growth of several of these groups separately, both in the U.S. and around the world, and the Center may do so again in the future. But, because data on religious switching and intergenerational transmission is less reliable for groups with small sample sizes in surveys, non-Christian groups are not shown separately in this report.\nThe report also does not project change for subgroups of Christians, such as Protestants and Catholics, or for subgroups of “nones,” such as atheists, agnostics and people who describe their religion as “nothing in particular.” For the latest figures on the religious composition of the U.S., including some subgroups, see our 2021 report, “About Three-in-Ten U.S. Adults Are Now Religiously Unaffiliated.”\nScenario assumptions and projection results\nThe four main scenarios presented here vary primarily in their assumptions about the future of religious switching among Americans between the ages of 15 and 29 – which are the years when most religious change happens. Only a modest amount of switching is modeled among older adults.\nFertility and mortality rates are held steady, as are rates of intergenerational transmission. In each scenario, the groups begin with their current profiles in terms of age and gender. Christians, for example, are older than the religiously unaffiliated, on average, and include a higher share of women.\nFinally, the models assume that migration remains constant, which helps explain why non-Christian groups follow the same trajectory in each of the four scenarios. Immigration has an outsized effect on the composition of non-Christian groups in the U.S. because adherents of religions like Islam and Hinduism make up a larger share of new arrivals than they do of the existing U.S. population.\nChapter 2 presents four additional scenarios that explore the impact of the factors held constant here. These additional projections show how the U.S. religious landscape might change if current switching patterns held steady, but intergenerational religious transmission occurred in 100% of cases; there were no fertility differences by religion; there was no switching after age 3\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, the complete disappearance of religion seems unlikely. However, the scenarios suggest that the percentage of Christians in the U.S. could decrease significantly over the next 50 years. Under the scenario where switching continues at recent rates, Christians would decline from 64% to between 35% and 54% of the population by 2070. In the scenario where switching accelerates, Christians could fall below 35% by 2070. Even if switching were to stop, Christians would still decline from 64% to 35% by 2070. Therefore, while religion may become less prominent in the future, it is unlikely to disappear completely in the near term. </think>\n\n<answer> No, religion is unlikely to completely disappear in the near term. </answer>",

    "question": "Should the United States increase or decrease its military spending and global military presence?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information gathered, it is evident that the U.S. defense budget is substantial, currently around 3.5% of GDP, and is expected to remain stable or possibly decrease due to political and budgetary constraints. The budget includes significant allocations for modernization, research and development, and readiness, indicating a focus on maintaining a qualitative edge rather than just increasing the size of the military.\n\nThe U.S. faces increasing threats from China and Russia, necessitating continued investment in defense capabilities. However, the current budget already provides a substantial amount of resources for these purposes. Therefore, the decision to increase or decrease military spending should balance the need for readiness and modernization with the constraints of the budget and the overall economic situation.\n</think>\n\n<answer> The decision to increase or decrease military spending should balance the need for readiness and modernization with the constraints of the budget and the overall economic situation. Given the substantial current budget and the ongoing threats from China and Russia, it may be more appropriate to maintain or slightly increase spending to ensure continued modernization and readiness. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo properly answer this question, I need to consider the current state of global security, the economic impact of military spending on the U.S., and the strategic importance of maintaining a strong military presence. However, these are complex issues that often involve political, economic, and strategic considerations that may not have a clear-cut answer.\n</think>\n\n<search> impacts of U.S. military spending on economy </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: d Security (but does include Department of Energy nuclear weapons expenses as well as most intelligence accounts and war costs), constitutes nearly 40 percent of global military spending. America’s allies and close friends account for another third or so of the global total, meaning that the Western alliance system wields the preponderance of global military resources even in the context of China’s rise and Russia’s revanchism.) Individual parts of the defense budget are reasonably healthy, too. Military compensation compares well with civilian jobs requiring comparable skills and experience across the bulk of military specialties. Weapons procurement budgets exceed $100 billion a year; the so-called “procurement holiday” of the 1990s and early 2000s is by now completely over.\nResearch and development budgets in 2019 are also robust. Funds for training are proportionate to the size of the force, akin to Reagan-era levels as well in terms of flight hours, steaming days, major ground exercises, and other core activities. The same is true of maintenance budgets. The problem with the latter accounts in recent years has been unpredictability and delay more than inadequate resources.\nBut at the same time, U.S. defense spending is hardly huge or unaffordable. Relative to the size of the economy, it is down to about 3.5 percent of GDP, after having reached nearly 5 percent in the late years of George W. Bush and early years of Obama. During the Cold War, it varied roughly between 5 percent and 10 percent of GDP, by way of comparison. Also, today’s U.S. military is modest in size. Its 1.3 million active-duty uniformed personnel are far fewer than the Cold War force that exceeded 2 million during its latter decades. It is also smaller than China’s and not much bigger than the Indian or North Korean militaries. In short, it is a reasonably expensive but affordable military that relies on sustaining a qualitative edge over adversaries to maintain its combat punch and to protect U.S. interests across the globe.\nU.S. military spending may well be, as President Obama noted in his 2016 State of the Union address, roughly equal to the next eight highest-spending countries combined.1 But defense budgets do not always dictate combat outcomes or ensure effective deterrence. Chinese precision missiles, Russian advanced air defenses, advanced submarines, cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and other such capabilities—whether operated by Beijing and Moscow or sold to other parties—can cause asymmetric, disproportionate effects.2 New technologies offer promise for America’s armed forces, but also new ways for adversaries to challenge or hurt the United States. As such, it is essential for the Department of Defense to have enough resources to pursue a qualitative military advantage over potential adversaries through a robust and well-directed modernization program.\nSo yes, U.S. military spending is large. Indeed, it is now roughly three times that of China’s, the world’s number-two military power—after having been nearly 10 times as great at the turn of the century. That may sound like a comfortable advantage. It is not, especially when the correct strategic goal for the United States military is not primarily to defeat China or Russia in combat but to deter China and Russia in the first place by being able to deny the objectives of any aggression and impose unacceptable costs.\nAs a result of military modernization and reform efforts this century, China now possesses advanced weapons systems including the DF-21 and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles with homing warheads, other precision-strike options that could be used against American and allied bases in the region, quiet submarines that could approach U.S. Seventh Fleet ships undetected, and potent threats against American cyber, space, and communications systems that have previously provided the United States with unalloyed asymmetric advantages.3 Russia, for its part, is in a position to move up\nDoc 2(Title: Department of Defense Releases the President's Fiscal Year 2024 Defense Budget) \n\n    *   Development of a resilient overhead persistent infrared capability in low earth orbit and medium earth orbit, and continuing to field the Next Generation Polar program.\n    *   Integration of the THAAD Battery capability into the Army's Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System planning process, and continuing development of the eighth THAAD Battery. \n    *   Advanced innovation technologies and demonstrations, including those involving cyber operations and hypersonic strike capabilities.\n    *   Defense of Guam against the missile threat from China - $1.5 billion.\n*   $11.0 billion to deliver a mix of highly lethal precision weapons.

Comparing defense spending between countries—whether nominally or as a percentage of government expenditure—is a useful gauge of relative military strength. Spending patterns can also reveal key political events that have implications for defense and national security.) Understanding the connection between China’s military spending and its military power is made difficult by a lack of transparency. Although Beijing provides figures for its defense spending each year, outside estimates of China’s defense budget are often significantly higher than the official numbers. China provides limited information on the distribution of its military spending, which further obscures spending patterns.\nDefense Spending Giants\nThis interactive compares China’s defense spending with that of other key countries. Use the filtering options to select other measures of spending or to look at another country grouping. Data provided by the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database.\nFilter by category:\nFilter by grouping:\nFilter by year:\nTracking Chinese Military Spending\nThere is no universally accepted standard for reporting military spending. While international mechanisms exist, such as the UN Report on Military Expenditures, participation is voluntary. This allows governments to report their expenditure with varying degrees of detail. China joined the UN instrument in 2007, but it remains less transparent than many countries.\nThe Chinese government announces defense expenditure information annually. In March 2025, China announced a yearly defense budget of RMB 1.78 trillion ($246.5 billion),1 marking a nominal 7.2 percent increase from the 2024 budget of 1.67 trillion ($231.3 billion).2 This continues a recent trend that has seen nominal yearly percentage increases in the upper single digits.\nWhile China releases an official defense budget, how much China actually spends on its military is widely debated. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates the overall 2023 figure to be $309 billion, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) puts the number at $319 billion. Both figures are considerably higher than that year’s official defense budget of approximately $225 billion.\nNotwithstanding these differences, Beijing’s official figures may now more accurately represent defense expenditures than in the past. In 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) reported that China’s actual defense spending may have been upwards of four times larger than its officially announced budget. In 2024, the DoD noted that China’s real military spending may be 40 to 90 percent higher than stated in its official budget.\nVarying levels of transparency from Beijing add challenges for outside efforts to estimate China’s defense budget. The publication of 11 defense white papers since 1995 has provided some insight into the nature of Chinese military spending but with varying degrees of specificity. White papers published between 1998 and 2008 included comparative budget breakdowns between China and countries like Japan and Russia. These comparisons were removed from white papers after 2008 but reappeared in the most recent white paper that was released in July 2019.\nMost defense white papers—except those released in 2013 and 2015—also outline three spending categories: personnel, training and maintenance, and equipment.3 Beijing states that it annually reports categorized military spending information to the UN; however, this information is only available from the UN in short reports for fiscal years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2017, 2020, 2021, and 2022.4 The reports from the mid-2000s show roughly equal spending between each of these three categories. The 2019 white paper, which includes spending breakdowns between 2010 and 2017, reveals a noticeable shift away from this even distribution, with equipment accounting for just over 41 percent\nDoc 5(Title:  China’s rise, with economic and diplomatic as well as military tools, had begun in the Obama administration, with the so-called pivot or rebalance to Asia starting in 2011. The changes intensified after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and aggression against eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the promulgation of a “third offset” modernization agenda. But Mattis brought even greater mission clarity—and more budgetary resources—to the Department of Defense. No one wants war with Russia or China. However, to prevent it, intensified efforts to shore up America’s deterrence of these two powers, especially for possible crises or conflicts in Eastern Europe and the western Pacific region, are entirely warranted.) All that said, the Mattis revolution is incomplete at best, and now it appears to be imperiled by a recent shift in political and budgetary winds. President Trump increased the U.S. national defense budget substantially in his first three years in office. But the 2020 national defense budget of $750 billion may well prove to be the peak level of the buildup. It is worth noting that former Secretary Mattis, former Joint Chiefs Chairman General Joseph Dunford, and most recently the independent congressionally-mandated National Defense Strategy Commission had all advocated ongoing real growth of at least 3 percent a year into the indefinite future. Based on Trump administration budget projections and other political realities, they seem unlikely to get their wish.\nThe Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives and the persistent presence of Tea Party Republicans in the Congress do not augur well for large increases in defense spending. After all, a federal budget deficit approaching $1 trillion is a national security concern, too. There is a real threat to long-term economic power and thus national security when publicly held debt approaches the size of GDP, as will likely happen in the 2020s. Given the realities of U.S. domestic politics, it is hard to believe that meaningful deficit reduction will happen without a broad sense of shared national sacrifice. Moreover, a boom-and-bust approach to defense spending results in billions being wasted through inefficiency. Stable and predictable defense budgets help U.S. taxpayers as well as America’s global credibility.\nThe Mattis agenda could suffer serious harm, and the nation could face growing risks, if the defense budget is slashed. Yet never-ending real (inflation-adjusted) growth, while affordable, may be neither necessary nor sensible given the rising U.S. debt. What to do?\nThe path ahead: Quality over quantity, modernization and readiness over force size and force structure\nFortunately, there is a lodestar that Pentagon officials can reference to guide their difficult work—consistent, we believe, with Mattis’ central priorities and with the nation’s strategic needs. Put bluntly, the military should not grow significantly in size, as all of the services currently intend. Prioritization should instead be given to longer-term innovation and modernization, as well as unit-by-unit readiness, of the current force.\nSo far, the one central flaw with much needed boosts in defense spending is the rapidly increasing resources that have allowed the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and defense agencies to have it all. The budgets of the services have not yet demonstrated the clarity and focus of Mattis’ strategic vision. Desires for a larger force have been tacked onto more crucial matters of military innovation, as well as repairs to readiness after two decades of war and one decade of bipartisan budgetary dysfunction in Washington.\nThe Army now wants to grow its active-duty force from some 480,000 soldiers to at least 500,000 and perhaps to 540,000. The Navy wants to increase the size of its fleet from some 285 ships to 355 (in fairness, that goal dates back to the latter Obama years). The Air Force came out with a plan in the fall of 2018 to increase its own force structure from 31\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information gathered, it is evident that the U.S. defense budget is substantial, currently around 3.5% of GDP, and is expected to remain stable or possibly decrease due to political and budgetary constraints.

Like normal, we got into an argument about which summer treat is better and I’m here to tell you that it’s frozen yogurt 100%.\nStarting with a general palette, frozen yogurt always has a delightful array of flavors for you to choose from. Not to mention, the self-serve function of frozen yogurt stores makes it so you can completely customize your cup. In contrast, the plain uniformity of ice cream leads people to get bored of their dessert midway through and end up giving it to someone else, or worse, throwing it out. I mean, for a dessert that’s supposed to be cooling, ice cream’s plastics sure are warming the earth.\nNot to mention, the aesthetic appeal of frozen yogurt completely wins over ice cream. Frozen yogurt is this wonderful, colorful array of everything you could ever want. It’s beautiful, it’s gorgeous, and it takes you back to that time in your childhood when the world simply seemed brighter. Ice cream, on the other hand, is the equivalent of a retirement home. Boring, mediocre, and with about as much fun as a white person’s grilled chicken. Don’t retire yourself and your creativity, don’t give in to societal expectations of uniformity, and don’t be part of the ford-assembly line type of life that ice cream gives you. Eat froyo.\nFurthermore, frozen yogurt is actually more healthy than ice cream. Healthline even says in a 2020 article that “because of the yogurt base, frozen yogurt is considered a healthier and lower fat dessert than ice cream.” Frozen yogurt will often give you more yogurt for less calories, less fat, and less sugar. Ice cream only gives you less of a will to live. This is just the cherry on top of all the reasons why frozen yogurt is better for summer and for you. Ice cream is nothing more than frozen cow juice and I think we all need to moo-ve on.\nAs high schoolers, we often compartmentalize our feelings and our opportunities. We shove ourselves into boxes to fit in, both socially and academically. Along the way, our sense of creativity and freedom gets lost. But, you can rejuvenate yourself and your childhood dreams with frozen yogurt. Express yourself in flavor combos and topping varieties. So, my dear readers, as the icon Dove Cameron once said, go get yourself some frozen yogurt, “because you only live once.”\nIce Cream is better – Emma Dram\nWhat’s that one phrase? I scream, you scream, we all scream for… frozen yogurt?\nAs many high schoolers can relate to, I have a devastatingly sweet tooth. Coming home from trips to the grocery store with what feels like enough sugar to make Willy Wonka go into cardiac arrest is the closest I’ve ever felt to god. And for those who know me, it’s a trademark of my personality that there is simply one sweet treat to satisfy my craving: ice cream.\nI’m here to say that ice cream is by far superior to any other cold and sugary treat out there, especially frozen yogurt. Dubbed “fro-yo” by those naive enough to support, this dish is not just subpar to the wonders of ice cream, it’s also aggressively average. There are tens, hundreds, thousands of reasons to proclaim in support of ice cream, but I only need convince you with one – variety.\nTo say ice cream has any less diverse of a flavor palette than frozen yogurt is simply inaccurate. You’ve got your classics – vanilla, chocolate, strawberry. Then you’ve got new age contemporaries – cookie dough, peanut butter cup, mint chocolate chip. If you look far enough (i.e. the nearest ice cream shop near you), you’ll even find crazy flavors like birthday cake, cotton candy, and strawberry cheesecake. Ice cream has range – I’d be satisfied with a cold bowl of plain vanilla just as easily as I’d be quenched by a heaping helping of rootin’ tootin’ tutti frutti.

Those of us who are white have a very hard time seeing that we constantly receive special treatment \\[because of social systems built to prioritize people with white skin\\]. This systemic “white privilege” makes it harder for us to recognize the experiences of people of color as valid and real when they speak of racial profiling, police brutality, discrimination in the workplace, continued segregation in schools, lack of access to housing, and on and on. This is not the experience of most white people, so how can it be true? _Now, we are being shown how limited our vision is._\n\nBecause we have never been on the other side, we largely do not recognize the structural access we enjoy, the trust we think we deserve, the assumption that we always belong and do not have to earn our belonging. All this we take for granted as normal. Only the outsider can spot these attitudes in us. \\[And we are quick to dismiss what is apparent to our neighbors who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color \\[BIPOC\\] from their lived experience.\\]\n\n_Of course, we all belong._ There is no issue of more or less in the eyes of an Infinite God. Yet the ego believes the lie that there isn’t enough to go around and that for me to succeed or win, someone else must lose. And so we’ve greedily supported systems and governments that work to our own advantage at the expense of others, most often people of color or any highly visible difference. The advancement of the white person was too often at the cost of other people not advancing at all. A minor history course should make that rather clear.\n\nI would have never seen my own white privilege if I had not been forced outside of my dominant white culture by travel, by working in the jail, by hearing stories from counselees and, frankly, by making a complete fool of myself in so many social settings—most of which I had the freedom to avoid!\n\nPower \\[and privilege\\] never surrenders without a fight. If your entire life has been to live unquestioned in your position of power—a power that was culturally given to you, but you think you earned—there is almost no way you will give it up without major failure, suffering, humiliation, or defeat. As long as we really want to be on top and would take advantage of any privilege or short cut to get us there, we will never experience true “liberty, equality, fraternity” (revolutionary ideals that endure as mottos for France and Haiti).\n\nIf God operates as me, God operates as “thee” too, and the playing field is utterly leveled forever. Like Jesus, Francis, Clare, and many other humble mystics, we then rush down instead of up. In the act of letting go and choosing to become servants, community can at last be possible. The illusory state of privilege just gets in the way of neighboring and basic human friendship.\n\n**Reference:  \n**Adapted from “Richard Rohr on White Privilege,” interview with Reverend Romal J.

For me, white privilege has turned out to be an elusive and fugitive subject. The pressure to avoid it is great, for in facing it I must give up the myth of meritocracy. If these things are true, this is not such a free country; one’s life is not what one makes it; many doors open for certain people through no virtues of their own.) In unpacking this invisible knapsack of white privilege, I have listed conditions of daily experience that I once took for granted. Nor did I think of any of these perquisites as bad for the holder. I now think that we need a more finely differentiated taxonomy of privilege, for some of these varieties are only what one would want for everyone in a just society, and others give license to be ignorant, oblivious, arrogant and destructive.\nI see a pattern running through the matrix of white privilege, a pattern of assumptions that were passed on to me as a white person. There was one main piece of cultural turf; it was my own turf, and I was among those who could control the turf. My skin color was an asset for any move I was educated to want to make. I could think of myself as belonging in major ways and of making social systems work for me. I could freely disparage, fear, neglect, or be oblivious to anything outside of the dominant cultural forms. Being of the main culture, I could also criticize it fairly freely.\nIn proportion as my racial group was being made confident, comfortable, and oblivious, other groups were likely being made inconfident, uncomfortable, and alienated. Whiteness protected me from many kinds of hostility, distress and violence, which I was being subtly trained to visit, in turn, upon people of color.\nFor this reason, the word “privilege” now seems to me misleading. We usually think of privilege as being a favored state, whether earned or conferred by birth or luck. Yet some of the conditions I have described here work systematically to overempower certain groups. Such privilege simply confers dominance because of one’s race or sex.\nI want, then, to distinguish between earned strength and unearned power conferred systemically. Power from unearned privilege can look like strength when it is in fact permission to escape or to dominate. But not all of the privileges on my list are inevitably damaging. Some, like the expectation that neighbors will be decent to you, or that your race will not count against you in court, should be the norm in a just society. Others, like the privilege to ignore less powerful people, distort the humanity of the holders as well as the ignored groups.\nWe might at least start by distinguishing between positive advantages, which we can work to spread, and negative types of advantage, which unless rejected will always reinforce our present hierarchies. For example, the feeling that one belongs within the human circle, as Native Americans say, should not be seen as privilege for a few. Ideally it is an unearned entitlement. At present, since only a few have it, it is an unearned advantage for them. This paper results from a process of coming to see that some of the power that I originally saw as attendant on being a human being in the United States consisted in unearned advantage and conferred dominance.\nThe question is: “Having described white privilege, what will I do to end it?\nI have met very few men who are truly distressed about systemic, unearned male advantage and conferred dominance. And so one question for me and others like me is whether we will be like them, or whether we will get truly distressed, even outraged, about unearned race advantage and conferred dominance, and, if so, what will we do to lessen them. In any case, we need to do more work in identifying how they actually affect our daily lives. Many, perhaps most, of our white students in the U.S. think that racism doesn’t affect them because they are not people of color, they do not see “whiteness” as a racial identity. In addition, since race and sex are not the on\nDoc 3(Title: Explaining White Privilege to a Broke White Person) \nEXPLAINING WHITE PRIVILEGE TO A\n\nBROKE WHITE PERSON...\n\nGina Crosley-Corcoran\n\nYears ago, some feminist on the internet told me I was \"Privileged.\"\n\n_\"WTH?!?\"_ I said.\n\nI came from the kind of Poor that people don't want to believe still exists in this country. Have you ever\n\nspent a frigid northern Illinois winter without heat or running water? I have. At twelve years old, were you\n\nmaking ramen noodles in a coffee maker with water you fetched from a public bathroom? I was. Have you\n\never lived in a camper year round and used a random relative's apartment as your mailing address? We\n\ndid. Did you attend so many different elementary schools that you can only remember a quarter of their\n\nnames? **Welcome to my childhood.**\n\nSo when that feminist told me I had \"white privilege,\" I told her that my white skin didn't do shit to prevent\n\nme from experiencing poverty. Then, like any good, educated feminist would, she directed me to Peggy\n\nMcIntosh's 1988 now-famous piece, \"White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack.\"\n\nAfter one reads McIntosh's powerful essay, it's impossible to deny that being born with white skin in\n\nAmerica affords people certain unearned privileges in life that people of another skin color simple are not\n\nafforded. For example:\n\n• \"I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race\n\nwidely represented.\"\n\n• \"When I am told about our national heritage or about “civilization,” I am shown that people of my\n\ncolor made it what it is.\"\n\n• \"If a traffic cop pulls me over or if the IRS audits my tax return, I can be sure I haven’t been\n\nsingled out because of my race.\"\n\n• \"I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time.\"\n\nIf you read through the rest of the list, you can see how white people and people of color experience the\n\nworld in two very different ways. BUT LISTEN: This is not said to make white people feel guilty about their\n\nprivilege. It's not your fault you were born with white skin and experience these privileges. BUT, whether\n\nyou realize it or not, you DO benefit from it, and it IS your fault if you don't maintain awareness of that\n\nfact.\n\nI do understand McIntosh's essay may rub some people the wrong way. There are several points on the\n\nlist that I felt spoke more to the author's status as a Middle Class person than a White Person. For\n\nexample:\n\n• \"If I should need to move, I can be pretty sure of renting or purchasing housing in an area, which I\n\ncan afford and in which I would want to live.\"\n\n• \"I can be pretty sure that my neighbors in such a location will be neutral or pleasant to me.\"\n\n• \"I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or\n\nharassed.\"\n\n• \"If I want to, I can be pretty sure of finding a publisher for this piece on white privilege.\"\n\nAnd there are so many more points in the essay where the word \"race\" could be substituted for the word\n\n\"class\" which would ultimately paint a very different picture. That is why I had such a hard time identifying\n\nwith this essay for so long. When I first wrote about White Privilege years ago, I demanded to know why\n\nthis White Woman felt that my experiences were the same as hers when no, my family most certainly\n\ncould not rent housing _\"in an area which we could afford and want to live.\"_\n\nAnd no, I couldn't go shopping without fear in our low income neighborhoods.\n\nThe idea that any ol' white person can find a publisher for a piece is most certainly a symptom of class\n\nprivilege. Having come from a family of people who didn't even graduate high school, who knew not a\n\nsingle academic or intellectual person, it would never occur to me to assume that I could be published. It\n\nis an absolute freak anomaly that I'm in graduate school considering not one person on either side of my\n\nfamily has a college degree. And it took me until my thirties to ever believe that someone from my\nDoc 4(Title: Explaining White Privilege to a Broke White Person) \nal language, and that I was born with an intellect and ambition that pulled\n\nme out of the poverty I was otherwise destined for. I was privileged to be able to marry my way \"up\" by\n\npartnering with a Privileged middle-class educated male who fully expected me to earn a college degree.\n\nThere are a million ways I experience Privilege, and some that I certainly don't. But thankfully,\n\nIntersectionality allows us to examine these varying dimensions and degrees of discrimination while\n\nraising awareness of the results of multiple systems of oppression at work.\n\n_Tell me, are you a White Person made uncomfortable by the term \"White Privilege?\" Does a more_\n\n_nuanced approach help you see your own Privilege more clearly?_\nDoc 5(Title: Explaining White Privilege to a Broke White Person) \nmic or intellectual person, it would never occur to me to assume that I could be published. It\n\nis an absolute freak anomaly that I'm in graduate school considering not one person on either side of my\n\nfamily has a college degree. And it took me until my thirties to ever believe that someone from my stock\n\ncould achieve such a thing. Poverty colors nearly everything about your perspective on opportunities for\n\nadvancement in life. Middle class, educated people assume that anyone can achieve their goals if they\n\nwork hard enough. Folks steeped in poverty rarely see a life past working at the gas station, making the\n\nrent on their trailer, and self-medicating with cigarettes and prescription drugs until they die of a heart\n\nattack. (I've just described one whole side of my family and the life I assumed I'd be living before I lucked\n\nout of it.)\n\nI, maybe more than most people, can completely understand why broke white folks get pissed when the\n\nword \"Privilege\" is thrown around. As a child, I was constantly discriminated against because of my\n\npoverty and those wounds still run very deep. But luckily my college education introduced me to a more\n\nnuanced concept of Privilege; the term Intersectionality. The concept of Intersectionality recognizes that\n\npeople can be privileged in some ways and definitely not privileged in others. There are many different\n\ntypes of privilege, not just skin color privilege, that impact the way people can move through the world or\n\nare discriminated against. These are all things you are born into, not things you earned, that afford you\n\nopportunities others may not have. For example:\n\n• **Citizenship** \\- Simply being born in this country affords you certain privileges non-citizens will\n\nnever access.\n\n• **Class** \\- Being born into a financially stable family can help guarantee your health, happiness,\n\nsafety, education, intelligence, and future opportunities.\n\n• **Sexual Orientation** \\- By being born straight, every state in this country affords you privileges that\n\nnon-straight folks have to fight the Supreme Court for.\n\n• **Sex** \\- By being born male, you can assume that you can walk through a parking garage without\n\nworrying you'll be raped and that a defense attorney will then blame it on what you were wearing.\n\n• **Ability** \\- By being born able bodied, you probably don't have to plan your life around handicap\n\naccess, braille, or other special needs.\n\n• **Gender** \\- By being born cisgendered, you aren't worried that the restroom or locker room you use\n\nwill invoke public outrage.\n\n• As you can see, belonging to one or more category of Privilege, especially being a Straight White\n\nMiddle Class Able-Bodied Male, can be like winning a lottery you didn't even know you were\n\nplaying. But this is not to imply that any form of privilege is exactly the same as another or that\n\npeople lacking in one area of privilege understand what it's like to be lacking in other areas. Race\n\ndiscrimination is not equal to Sex Discrimination and so forth.\n\nAnd listen, recognizing Privilege doesn't mean suffering guilt or shame for your lot in life. Nobody's saying\n\nthat Straight White Middle Class Able-Bodied Males don't work hard for what they have. Recognizing\n\nPrivilege simply means being aware that some people have to work much harder just to experience the\n\nthings you take for granted (if they ever can experience them at all.)\n\nI know now that I AM Privileged in many ways. I am Privileged as a natural born white citizen. I am\n\nprivileged as a cis-gendered woman. I am privileged as an able-bodied person. I am privileged that my\n\nfirst language is also our national language, and that I was born with an intellect and ambition that pulled\n\nme out of the poverty I was otherwise destined for. I was privileged to be able to marry my way \"up\" by\n\npartnering with a Privileged middle-class educated male who fully expected me to earn a college degree.\n\nThere are a m\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the documents provided, the concept of white privilege refers to the unearned advantages and benefits that white individuals often receive due to the societal structures and systemic biases in place.

However, I lack specific data on these areas, so I should perform a search for more detailed information.</think>\n\n<search> environmental impact of bottled water, health benefits of bottled water, economic aspects of bottled water </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: I often hear of arguments saying bottles of mineral water should be banned. The logic of banning bottled water is that it is a strong commitment to reducing single-use plastic which has high environmental costs. However, others argue it is a rather drastic measure which only tackles small part of the problem.) Reasons to ban bottled water\n- Plastic bottles require oil, water and environmental costs of transporting. This use of oil and plastic contributes to global warming, carbon emissions and is unecessary.\n- Creates unnecessary landfill. Many plastic bottles end up as litter in the sea or the countryside where the plastic doesn’t degrade. This is both a visual eyesore but can cause problems and even death for wildlife.\n- The water footprint of a bottled water is greater than just the water involved. Bottled water requires water in the packaging, production and distribution stage.\n- Banning bottled water will encourage people to choose sustainable alternatives – refillable water.\n- Already airports are providing places to top up water bottles rather than expect people to buy new ones.\nReasons not to ban bottled water\n1. Water has a lower water footprint than other drinks. According to IBWA water has the lowest water footprint of any drink\nIt takes:\n- 1.39 litres to make one litre of bottled water\n- 2.02 litres for one-liter soda.\n- 4 litres of water for one-litre beer\n- 4.74 litres for one-litre wine.\n- 34.5 litres of water for every litre of alcoholic spirits\n2. Encourages less healthy options. If bottled water is banned, but people want to drink they will be forced to choose less healthy options such as sugary and carbonated drinks. The problem of single-use plastic is not reduced, but we just see a rise in demand for other types of bottled drinks.\n3. It takes away people’s choice of whether to buy water. Why should we ban bottled water, but not soda and alcohol which is worse for you?\n4. There are better ways to deal with the problem of single-use plastic. Rather than ban bottled water, it would be better to tackle the wider issue. This could involve an ‘environmental tax’ on all plastic, single-use drinks. This provides a financial incentive to cut back on buying plastic bottles. The revenue raised could be used to fund clean-up operations in the sea and rivers.\n5. Tap water may be unsafe or more likely to contain contaminants. Even in the US, potentially millions of people are drinking unsafe tap water. (Science Mag) One study found that during the Flint water crisis in 2015, nearly 21 million Americans—about 6%—were getting water from systems that violated health standards.\nPersonal view\nFor what it is worth I’d like to give my twopence worth on this topic. But, first, I have to admit my bias and prejudices. The thing is I don’t drink alcohol, I don’t drink soft drinks – I really hate Coke and things like that. I’m vegetarian. I cycle to work. I vote Green (if I ever get round to voting). I get up at 6 am in the morning to meditate. But, I do have one weakness – I really like drinking bottled water.\nSometimes, I like to sip the nicely carbonated San Pelegrino, other times I like to drink the pure still Evian. Sometimes I drink filtered tap water. But, water is the only thing I like to drink. I know it’s a bad habit – But, I’ve tried to kick it without success.\nAnd I’m sure people are right when they say Thames tap water is much better for your health than Evian. (I mean all those nitrates, and chlorine is good for you right ?) And the fact tap water gets recycled seven times means it must be very eco.\nTax Bottled Water\nNow as an economist I’m very fond of Pigouvian taxes. I believe we should have higher taxes on petrol, Fatty foods e.t.c\nIf people think bottled water has negative externalities (pollution, unnecessary landfill) then I’d be happy for an appropriate tax to be placed on bottled water so bad people like me can pay the true social cost.\nBut, if we tax bottled water shouldn’t we tax soft drinks? And is not wate\nDoc 2(Title: foods e.t.c) If people think bottled water has negative externalities (pollution, unnecessary landfill) then I’d be happy for an appropriate tax to be placed on bottled water so bad people like me can pay the true social cost.\nBut, if we tax bottled water shouldn’t we tax soft drinks? And is not water good for you? Maybe we should subsidise bottled water and tax soft drinks to encourage people to drink sugar-free liquid?\nRelated\nDoc 3(Title: Should we be able to cause major environmental damage just because it is convenient? Individuals purchasing bottled water seem to think so. In addition to harming our world, water bottles can cause risks to human health, are a waste of money, and are a drain on water and energy sources. Colleges and universities all over the country are recognizing this and as of 2012, more than 90 schools either banned or restricted the sale of plastic water bottles on campus. To continue sustainability efforts, Duke University should take similar action, banning these bottles and encouraging the use of reusable water bottles and existing water fountains and hydration stations.) Despite attempts to encourage recycling, 38 billion water bottles, or 80% of bottles purchased, end up in landfills each and every year. This wouldn’t be so horrifying if it weren’t for the fact that waste from these products never really goes away. The bottles that we get rid of, end up poisoning us. Because most water bottles are made of petroleum-based polyethylene terephthalate (also known as PET), they break down through photodegradation into smaller and smaller pieces instead of biodegrading. This does not frequently happen in landfills since bottles are not likely to be exposed to the sun. However, ten percent of plastic (3.8 billion water bottles annually) ends up in the ocean as a result of trash being deposited in waterways by humans, wind, and heavy rains. Once exposed to sunlight, breakdown of these plastics results in toxic chemicals, including BPA and PS oligomer. These toxins are ingested by ocean animals, which can be ingested by humans and cause serious health risks.\nIn addition to damaging our health and environment, these bottles damage our economy. Would you be willing to pay $1.45 every time you wanted to fill up a water bottle using the faucet in your kitchen? As it turns out, you may be doing that without knowing it. The Natural Resources Defense Council found that 25 percent or more of bottled water is really just tap water. Tap water itself costs only about 0.9 cents per gallon, meaning that when we buy bottled water, we are paying 560 times what that amount of water is worth. As a country experiencing hard economic times, does it make sense for us to be paying this much for a resource that we can get from a faucet for free? Americans spent $11.8 billion on water bottles in 2012 alone. This is $11.8 billion that we are able to put right back in our pockets by making a simple behavioral change. Duke University should play a part in helping us make better economic decisions by having students and faculty take advantage of water fountains and water bottle refilling stations that have already been installed all over campus.\nLastly, the production of water bottles is a huge waste of oil and water. Despite the fact that water bottle companies claim to be a “healthy and eco-friendly choice”, the production of bottled water uses 17 million barrels of oil each year, which is enough to fill a million cars for a year and takes three liters of water just to bottle one liter. When taking into account production and transportation of these bottles in the United States, the Environmental Research Letters journal estimated that 32 to 54 million barrels of oil are used annually, which represents almost a third of our entire country’s energy consumption. This is energy that does not have to be used if we just turn on our tap. As Duke University moves towards becoming carbon neutral, banning water bottles on campus will be an important step.\nOur university needs to recognize and communicate the implications of selling water bottles on campus. If banning water bottles seems too extreme, the administration should, at a minimum, post and distribute information telling consumers of the impacts of their choices. Misinformation or lack of information is not an excuse at one of the best universities in the country. However, I think that the best option is simply to ban \nDoc 4(Title: anitation. [25]) Leslie Davenport, a climate psychology educator, explains that consumers buy into greenwashing unconsciously, because “there can be an unexamined story of ‘I’m doing my part’ because it is more soothing than feeling out of control with the harmful and terrifying trajectory we are on with climate change.” [17]\nAt this point, virtually all claims of plastic recyclability are egregiously false. Greenpeace urges “instead of continuing on this false path, companies in the U.S. and around the world must urgently phase out single-use plastics by replacing their packaging with reuse and refill systems and offering packaging free products.” Bans can assist in this effort. [26]\nCon Arguments\n(Go to Pro Arguments)Con 1: Single-use plastics are sanitary, convenient, and efficient and used in important ways, especially in medicine.\nFrom aiding people with disabilities to keeping food fresh, from reducing transportation emissions to aiding in medical treatment, single-use plastics are much more than “convenient.”\nPeople with disabilities rely on single-use plastics for a variety of reasons. Many cannot lift a cup to their mouth and must rely upon a straw that they cannot easily wash; many cannot manage food preparation and need sliced fruit in a plastic container. Alternatives to single-use plastic can be prohibitively expensive and difficult to maintain for those with disabilities. [28]\nWhy can’t food be packaged in something other than plastic? The simple answer is that plastic keeps food fresh. Emmerson Packaging cites several studies showing that “cucumbers wrapped in plastic last 14 days longer than unwrapped cucumbers; bananas wrapped in plastic last 21 days longer than their unwrapped counterparts; beef wrapped in plastic vacuum packaging with an oxygen barrier film lasts 26 days longer; [and] selling grapes in plastic bags or trays has reduced in-store wastage of grapes by 20 percent.” Keeping food fresh longer not only reduces food waste but also increases the accessibility of healthful foods to “food deserts.” [29]\nFresh food like produce travels an average of 1,500 miles from farm to grocery store. Plastic packaging ensures the food is not damaged during transport and reduces transportation emissions, because it’s lighter than alternatives. [30][31][32][33]\nAdditionally, we rarely think beyond food in terms of single-use plastics. However, single-use plastics are crucial in the medical field, from PPE (masks and surgical gowns) to syringes and blood-transfer bags. Single-use plastics keep patients and providers safe by providing them with tools and drugs that are sterile. We can’t ban all single-use plastic without providing accessible, appropriate, and safe alternatives. [34]\nCon 2: Single-use plastic bans spawn complacency and mask a greater need—a reduction in all plastic production and use.\nThe problem is not consumer use of single-use plastic, but the enormous production of all plastic. Single-use plastic bans mask this larger issue, which poses problems for both our environment and our health.\nEven with every mitigating policy on the consumer side—bans, recycling, and others—“we would still release more than 17 million tons of plastic per year into nature,” according to Melanie Bergmann, a plastic pollution and microplastic expert at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. Bergmann says, “The science is crystal clear. Only upstream measures such as a cap on plastic production will prevent further degradation of our life-supporting ecosystems and allow us at the same time to reduce the carbon footprint of plastics, which makes up 4.5 percent of the global CO₂ emissions.” [35]\nIn perspective, CO₂ emissions from plastic production are expected to outpace the poster child of climate pollution—coal—by 2030. Thus, dealing with single-use plastic waste is only a bandage on the larger problem of plastic production. [35]\nWhile a world without any plastic is farfetched, “it is crucial that the production of new plast\nDoc 5(Title: eems too extreme, the administration should, at a minimum, post and distribute information telling consumers of the impacts of their choices.

This approach often stresses the patient's preferences, and it attempts to address the mental, physical, and spiritual aspects of health.\nConventional medicine is a system in which health professionals who hold an M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degree treat symptoms and diseases using drugs, radiation, or surgery. It is also practiced by other health professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and therapists. It may also be called allopathic medicine, biomedicine, Western, mainstream, or orthodox medicine.

Health service managers are key stakeholders central to ensuring effective integrative health care services. Yet, little research has specifically investigated the role or perspective of health service managers with regards to integrative health care services under their management. In response, this paper reports findings from an exploratory study focusing exclusively on the perspectives of health service managers of integrative health care services in Australia regarding the role of CAM within their service and the health service managers rational for incorporating CAM into clinical care.\nMethods\nHealth service managers from seven services were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the health service managers. The services addressed trauma and chronic conditions and comprised: five community-based programs including drug and alcohol rehabilitation, refugee mental health and women’s health; and two hospital-based specialist services. The CAM practices included in the services investigated included acupuncture, naturopathy, Western herbal medicine and massage.\nResults\nFindings reveal that the health service managers in this study understand CAM to enhance the holistic capacity of their service by: filling therapeutic gaps in existing healthcare practices; by treating the whole person; and by increasing healthcare choices. Health service managers also identified CAM as addressing therapeutic gaps through the provision of a mind-body approach in psychological trauma and in chronic disease management treatment. Health service managers describe the addition of CAM in their service as enabling patients who would otherwise not be able to afford CAM to gain access to these treatments thereby increasing healthcare choices. Some health service managers expressly align the notion of treating the whole person within a health promotion model and focus on the relevance of diet and lifestyle factors as central to a CAM approach.\nConclusions\nFrom the perspectives of the health service managers, these findings contribute to our understanding around the rationale to include CAM within mainstream health services that deal with psychological trauma and chronic disease. The broader implications of this study can help assist in the development of health service policy on CAM integration in mainstream healthcare services.\nKeywords: Integrative healthcare, Integrative medicine, Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), Health services research, Chronic disease management, Psychological trauma management, Drug and alcohol rehabilitation\nBackground\nComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly included within mainstream integrative healthcare (IHC) services for example [1-4]. To date, much of the focus in integrative health care research has aimed to: ‘identify factors related to successful integration of CAM and conventional medicine’ [5: 33]; to develop theoretical frameworks to explain the various models of integrative health care [5-9]; and to establish guidelines for effective integrative health care practice [10-12]. Significantly, the vast majority of this literature has focused on the perspectives of patients and practitioners, overlooking the role of health service managers in the practice of effective integrative health care [13].\nWithin the integrative health care literature, scholars increasingly report CAM to be popular and/or efficacious for the treatment and management of chronic health conditions [1,14-18]; and especially for the treatment of pain and stress related conditions [19-23]. Burke [24]: 932] argues that CAM may provide ‘potentially more effective multidisciplinary approaches to treating complex, chronic health problems such as HIV, chronic pain, and addiction’.

The lack of evidence plagues large sections of complementary and alternative medicine. For a few treatments, however, our knowledge is sufficiently advanced to allow preliminary risk benefit analyses (see table 1). In some cases (for example, ginkgo biloba for intermittent claudication) the balance is positive8; in other instances (for example, chelation therapy for intermittent claudication) it is negative.5 This underscores the point made earlier: generalisations are not possible, and those who offer them must be listened to with scepticism.\nThe principle of “net benefit” should also include costs. Complementary and alternative medicine is not cheap. Extrapolation from the results of the telephone survey,14 suggests that Britain's annual expenditure is around £1.6 billion, and providers' fees are considerable (table 2).22 But costs must not be viewed in isolation; the real question is whether the use of complementary and alternative medicine increases or decreases overall expenditure in our healthcare system. To answer it, one would require reliable cost evaluation studies. Few such investigations are available to date, the most rigorous of which negate the hypothesis that use of complementary and alternative medicine reduces overall expenditure.23\nTable 2.\nMedian duration varied from 30 min (chiropractic) to 90 min (homoeopathy) for 1st visit and from 15 min (chiropractic) to 60 min (acupuncture) for second visit.\nAssociation with powerful non-specific effects\nIt has been pointed out repeatedly that complementary and alternative medicine can be “ineffective” (in the sense of not being better than a placebo) and still do a world of good to the wellbeing of our patients.24 Some argue that complementary and alternative medicine should be used regardless of the results of placebo controlled clinical trials, particularly when its use is not associated with serious risks (see table 1). In such cases, rigorous research could even be seen as counterproductive. We might, for instance, find little “hard” evidence in favour of aromatherapy; if its “ineffectiveness” became known its availability would decrease, and yet aromatherapy could considerably help patients through its non-specific effects.24\nSuch arguments cannot be used against the rigorous investigation of complementary and alternative medicine. If research really showed that aromatherapy has no adverse effects and helps people through powerful non-specific (placebo) effects, the medical community should start seriously considering the power of placebos. The research question then shifts to how non-specific effects might be optimised so that more patients (not just those seeing an aromatherapist) can profit from them. Even in this (worst case) scenario, research would yield clinically valuable information.\nConclusion\nWe should listen less to the opinions of those who either overtly promote or stubbornly reject complementary and alternative medicine without acceptable evidence. The many patients who use complementary and alternative medicine deserve better. Patients and healthcare providers need to know which forms are safe and effective. Its future should (and hopefully will) be determined by unbiased scientific evaluation.\nAcknowledgments\nThis is an edited version of a presentation at the the Millennium Festival of Medicine in London, 6-10 November 2000.\nBased on a presentation from the Millennium Festival of Medicine\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nReferences\n- 1.Ernst E, Resch KL, Mills S, Hill R, Mitchell A, Willoughby M, et al.

They argue that it is individualised, holistic, intuitive, etc, and call for a “paradigm shift” in research. Usually these arguments are based on a series of misunderstandings, and often the problems can be resolved by clearly defining the research question and subsequently finding the research tool that optimally matches it. If the aim is to test the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine, randomised controlled trials usually provide the least biased method for finding a reliable answer.17) While few obstacles to research exist in principle, there are many in practice. Complementary and alternative medicine lacks both a research tradition and a research infrastructure and therefore fails to attract experienced researchers. Most importantly perhaps, the orthodox attitude remains highly (some would say destructively) sceptical, and as a consequence the funding of research is dismal.18\nOpinion based medicine\nNumerous indicators suggest that complementary and alternative medicine is largely opinion based. In the course of writing a strictly evidence based reference book of complementary and alternative medicine, I extracted all complementary therapies recommended for defined medical conditions in seven recent and seemingly authoritative books on the subject. Subsequently, I contrasted the results with the hard evidence from systematic reviews. More than 100 different complementary therapies were recommended for asthma, while systematic reviews failed to back up a single treatment for this indication.19 There was little agreement between the seven books. For instance, rarely was one treatment for asthma recommended by more than two authors. The exceptions were acupuncture, which was backed by four authors, and homoeopathy, which was backed by six authors. Yet neither of these treatments was supported by acceptable evidence.20,21 Even more surprisingly, less than half of these authors recommended St John's wort for depression, which happens to be of proved effectiveness.7 Opinions that often contradict the existing evidence seem to dominate complementary and alternative medicine, and this highlights the necessity of bringing opinion into line with evidence. The best way to achieve this is through rigorous research and the broad dissemination of its findings.\nHard evidence is scarce\nIf there are no funds there will be no research. If there is no research, we will be unable to find out whether complementary and alternative medicine does more good than harm. Yet this is the central question destined to determine its role in future health care. Simple answers or broad generalisations are not possible. Each of the numerous techniques has to be evaluated separately and on its own merits. Some forms of complementary and alternative medicine are safe but others aren't; some are effective while others may be pure placebos (see table 1).\nIt seems blatantly obvious that only well designed clinical investigations can establish the truth. Those who would prefer to bypass rigorous research—for example, by shifting the discussion towards patients' preference—and hope to integrate unproved treatments into routine health care are unlikely to succeed in the long run. Those who believe that regulation is a substitute for evidence will find that even the most meticulous regulation of nonsense must still result in nonsense. And those who insist that the evidence to support complementary and alternative medicine can legitimately be softer than in mainstream medicine will have to reconsider their position. Double standards in medicine existed for many years; undoubtedly they still exist today, but hopefully their days are numbered.\nThe lack of evidence plagues large sections of complementary and alternative medicine. For a few treatments, however, our knowledge is sufficiently advanced to allow preliminary risk benefit analyses (see table 1).

Asian Americans have the highest median income, followed by White Americans, Hispanic Americans, African Americans, and Native Americans.[2] A variety of explanations for these differences have been proposed—such as differing access to education,[3] two parent home family structure (70% of African American children are born to parents who are not legally married), high school dropout rates and experience of discrimination and deep-seated and systemic anti-Black racism—and the topic is highly controversial.\nWhen the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, it became illegal for employers to discriminate based on race;[4] however, income disparities have not flattened out.[5][6][7] After the passage of the act, the wage gap for minority groups narrowed, both in absolute difference with white wages and as a percentage of white wages, until the mid-1970s; at this time, progress for many racial minorities slowed, stopped, or reversed.[6] As of 2009, the median weekly wage for African American and Hispanic workers was about 65 percent and 61 percent that of white workers, respectively. Asian workers' median wage was about 110 percent that of white workers.[8] Overall, minority women's wages in comparison to those of white women are better than minority men's wages when compared to those of white men.[6]\nWages from the labor market are the primary source of income for most families in America,[6] and income is a socio-demographic status indicator that is important in understanding the building of wealth.[7]\nHistory of the racial wage gap\n[edit]The documented history of the racial wage gap in the United States goes back before the Civil Rights Act, where many modern causes of racial wage inequity, such as educational disparities and discrimination, stem from were even more prevalent. Public state records from the 1930s indicate white owned schools in the south spent approximately $61 per student, or $1,074.14 in 2018 dollars when adjusted for inflation, compared to just $9 per student, or $158.48 in 2018 dollars. Simultaneously, the same schools saw a discrepancy in school time, with white schools in sessions for 156 days on average, compared to 123 days on average for black schools.[9]\nWhile statistical measures of wage discrepancy between black individuals and their white counterparts exist, wage inequity is still poorly understood due to a lack of literature with solid empirical data to link data with an accurate model of wage discrimination.[9] During the 1970s and 80s the scholarly community debated the link between geographical location and wage inequality. Following urban-dominated studies and shifting research based on evolved conceptual and study-driven thinking, sociologists determined that the racial composition of a local population affects racial wage inequality. Studies performed by Leslie Mcall[10] indicate immigration population density is one of the leading factors in racial wage inequality. While black immigrant earnings do not deviate from the already substandard average earnings,[11][12] numbers on Hispanic and Asian immigrant earnings suggest more extensive negative effects, especially in areas of high immigration density. Hispanic and Asian women, in particular, are shown to be most affected; Hispanic and Asian women are shown to fill less skilled, domestic service jobs where the concentration of their black and white counterparts are lower. Barriers such as language show that such large dominance of immigrant population in such sectors only breed competition between lower-earning groups, further lowering average wages for such families.[10] Since 1980, studies have found that, conversely, such low earning labor may actually boost the economy as a whole, keeping many corporations and higher level jobs afloat with cheap skilled work, boosting the salaries of n\nDoc 2(Title:  Americans are the poorest ethnic group when measured by per capita income.[citation needed] The wage gap has been attributed by some to \"human capital differences.\" There is debate as to whether discrimination affects the wage gap.[6]) Wage Inequality by Race\n[edit]The differences in earnings between white men and minority workers were analyzed by PayScale from a sample of 1.8 million workers between the years 2017 and 2019. It was found that Black men get paid 87 cents for every dollar a white male gets paid. However, it was also found that even as minority men climb up the corporate ladder, they are still getting paid less than white men who are in the same positions and have the same qualifications, the more professionally prepared black men become the smaller the pay gap becomes. To be more specific, Black men who are qualified get paid 98 cents for every dollar a white male gets paid.[41]\nOther issues are contributing to the racial wage gap. These being the opportunity gap and occupational segregation. These issues are influenced by the inability for minorities to have access to the same type of education as the white population, or sometimes to even be able to achieve a higher education. The NWLC found that full time Black women workers are getting paid 60 cents for every dollar a white male is getting paid. It is important to mention that Black women make up about 10% of the low-wage workforce. On average, while a Black full time working women in a high paying job makes about $70,000 yearly, a white male makes $100,000.[42]\nThinkNow research found that even after completing undergraduate and graduate degrees, Black and Hispanics made much less money than white workers with the same, or even less education. Some of the policies that were proposed to confront the racial wage gap were reinforcing employment anti-discrimination laws, providing tax incentives for minority entrepreneurs, performing pay audits, banning the right to ask applicants about their salary history, and upgrading technology to assist during hiring decision to eliminate possible bias.[43]\nWomen and Wage Inequality\n[edit]Minority women have been the backbone of the U.S. economy as workers and caregivers. During COVID, the U.S relied on minority women to provide essential worker services and keep the economy going, however also caused a lot of job losses within the group. Despite this, it has been shown that women of color still earn a lot less than white males and even minority men. This is largely attributed to the undervaluation that is given to work done by women and the many biases that come with that.[44]\nIn a research study conducted by economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, it was found that 62% of the wage gap is attributed to differences in types of industries employed in, differences in hours worked, and differences in years of experiences. However, the other 38% of the wage gap is mostly attributed to discrimination and biases against minority women. Occupational segregation has played a big part in driving minority women towards low-wage jobs such as service jobs like being cashiers, care jobs such as nursing assistants, and domestic work as maids and housekeepers.[44]\nMinority women disproportionately shoulder responsibilities as primary caregivers and breadwinners for their family. Therefore, driving them to accept or choose jobs such as service and care industries that pay a lot less and have a lot less benefits simply because they are jobs that are readily available. These types of jobs are usually able to offer different shifts throughout the night and day, making it more accessible for these minority women to work part time in order to fulfill their obligations as caretakers in their own family, putting them at a financial disadvantage as well.[44]\nPrivate vs. public sector employment\n[edit]The racial wage gap for blacks and whites has been observed to be lower in the public sector than the private sector. In a 2001 analysis, a $3.\nDoc 3(Title: ulfill their obligations as caretakers in their own family, putting them at a financial disadvantage as well.[44]) Private vs. public sector employment\n[edit]The racial wage gap for blacks and whites has been observed to be lower in the public sector than the private sector. In a 2001 analysis, a $3.65 difference per hour was found between blacks and whites in the private sector, a 34 percent difference.[22] In contrast, a smaller difference of $2.85 per hour was found in the public sector, a 21 percent difference.[22] For the 23 percent of blacks that work in the public sector, evidence suggests that wages are based primary on individual qualifications, but for the 77 percent of blacks employed in the private sector, this assertion has not been found to be as valid.[22]\nAdditionally, a larger percentage of the wage gap was found to be accounted for by the human capital characteristics of educational attainment and potential years of experience in the public than private sector.[22] Also, an effect encountered in the private sector in which black males have higher absolute wages as they increase in status but lower wages relative to whites of the same status, has not been found in the public sector.[22]\nPolicy discussion\n[edit]Various solutions to eliminate the racial wage gap have been proposed. Research has identified different wage gaps and sources of wage gaps for different minorities, suggesting that public policies will affect different minorities in different ways and that effective strategies must take into account the unique circumstances of each race group.[16] Sociologist Douglas Massey offers two solutions to alleviate wage inequality: greater investments in education and elimination of racial segregation. He notes that, in a globalized economy, those with only physical labor to offer suffer.[20]\nHe argues that investments in education, especially higher education, will result in higher rates of economic growth and lower income inequality. By eliminating racial segregation, Massey argues that many divides between races that exist would be broken down, including income segregation. To accomplish the abolition of racial segregation, Massey argues, simple enforcement of legislation already in place, such as the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act, is required.[20] For more group-specific policies, focus on education and language inequalities could be helpful in equalizing employment opportunities, but other more specific policies are dependent on further research on wage gaps for various groups.[16]\nTo tackle wage inequality specifically in companies, random job audits at the national, state, and local levels have been suggested. Audits have been used to study and find wage inequality in the past and could be used as way to actively monitor the presence of the racial wage gap in companies.[4] Other policies that could possibly help merge the wage gap are guaranteeing employment and significantly raising the minimum wage. Another factor that should be taken into consideration is Medicare for all. Poor access to healthcare and healthcare outcomes are important because many low-income people can’t have access to it. Many low-income individuals have health issues that prevent them from being part of the working population, therefore putting them at a financial disadvantage. Even if they are able to access healthcare, it ends up destabilizing them financially.[45]\nLimitations and criticisms of the racial wage gap\n[edit]Evaluating and understanding the causes and consequences of the racial wage gap for various races is an important part of understanding racial inequality in the United States; however, the wage gap does not encompass all aspects of inequality and therefore is useful when understood in conjunction with other types of inequalities. For example, sociologists Mary C. Waters and Karl Eschbach note that other types of inequalities are important for a holistic under\nDoc 4(Title: ges: 67.7 percent in 2000, 64.0 percent in 2005, 67.5 percent in 2008, and 64.5 percent in 2009.[18] The absolute difference in black and white wages, however, has decreased over this period.[18]) Black Americans now number 36 million, 12.9% of the total population.[24] As of 2009, the median black male income was $23,738, compared to the median white non-Hispanic male income of $36,785.[18]\nWhile progress in wage inequality for blacks has been made since the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, inequality and discrimination still exist. A study conducted by Major G. Coleman (2003) reports that as black and white men have more similar competitive performance ratings, racial wage differences increase rather than decrease. He also found that black wages are less than white wages in the same industry.[4] When no factors other than race are considered, Coleman predicts the black hourly wage to be $7.49 and the white hourly wage to be $8.92, 19 percent higher than the black hourly wage. When Coleman controlled for human capital, such as education and skills, the difference decreased to 11 percent. Coleman attributed this 11 percent difference to racial discrimination.[4]\nGrodsky and Pager also calculated wage differences, and found blacks to make $3.65 less per hour than whites in the private sector and $2.85 less in the public sector.[22] Using statistical regressions, they found that human capital, region, and marital status account for 55 percent of the wage gap difference. An additional 20 percent of the wage gap was attributed to differences in occupational distributions between blacks and whites. Thus, 25 percent of the wage gap was unaccounted for by their model.[22]\nBlack women experience more wage equality in comparison to white women than black men do to white men. By the mid-1970s, wages for black and white women were almost equal; however, since then, black women's wages have decreased about 10 percent relative to white women's wages.[5] This difference that emerged has been attributed to the increase of white women in the labor force following the mid-1970s.[6]\nIt has been suggested that when more white women began working, the advantages of black women from unmeasured differences in labor force attachment disappeared, revealing a racial wage gap. While an overall wage gap appeared between black and white women, by 1980, the earnings of black women with college degrees surpassed those of white women with college degrees.[6] An understanding of the earnings of black women has recently become recognized as an important area of research due to the role that black women traditionally have in terms of family income: black married couples typically have relied more on women's earnings than other races and the percentage of single-parent, female-maintained families is highest among the black population.[5]\nHispanic\n[edit]The Hispanic minority group in the United States, composed of 50.3 million individuals in 2010,[25] consists of much variance within itself with regard to wages, though all groups' wages are lower than those of non-Hispanic whites.[26] In 2007, the largest Hispanic group, consisting of 29.2 million people, were individuals of Mexican origin, followed by 4.1 million people of Puerto Rican origin and 1.6 million people of Cuban origin.[27] By 2009, the median income of Hispanics was lower than that of Whites and Asians, but much higher than the median wages of African-Americans; $38,039, compared to $32,584 for African-Americans and $49,777 for the general population.[18] While their relative wages have fallen since 1979, this has been attributed to a demand for more educated workers and a gap in educational attainment, supported by the fact that college-educated Hispanic men's relative wages have changed little over time.[5]\nUnlike research findings for the black minority, it has been a converging finding that the largest contributing factor to the wage gap of Hispanics is observable skill characteristics, es\nDoc 5(Title: e and Unequal in the Labor Market: Human Capital and the Jim Crow Wa...: EBSCOhost\" (PDF).

    "question": "What should be done with the minimum wage?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information gathered, it seems that setting the minimum wage involves several considerations. One key factor is ensuring that it keeps up with inflation and productivity gains. Currently, the federal minimum wage in the U.S. is $7.25 per hour, which has lost significant purchasing power over time. Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, as proposed in some reports, could significantly help low-income workers and potentially boost consumer spending. However, it's important to balance this with the potential impact on businesses, particularly small ones, and the overall economy.\n\nIn practice, the minimum wage can vary based on local laws, and employers must adhere to the highest applicable minimum wage. For instance, in Los Angeles County, the minimum wage is currently $17.81 per hour as of July 1, 2025. Employers must ensure they comply with these regulations, including posting notices and maintaining accurate payroll records.\n\nTo summarize, the best practices for setting the minimum wage involve regular reviews to ensure it reflects current economic conditions, including inflation and productivity, while considering the impact on businesses and the broader economy. Local governments often set specific minimum wage levels that employers must follow, and it's crucial to stay informed about these changes and comply with them.</think>\n\n<answer> Regularly reviewing and adjusting the minimum wage to reflect current economic conditions, including inflation and productivity, while considering the impact on businesses and the broader economy, is a best practice.

The reasons for weaponizing division are not mysterious. Racial fear prevents Americans from building community with one another — and community is the lifeblood of a functioning democratic society. Throughout our history, racist language has been used to turn American against American in order to benefit the wealthy elite. Every time Mr. Trump attacks refugees is a time that could be spent discussing the president's unwillingness to raise the federal minimum wage for up to 33 million Americans. Every racist attack on four members of Congress is a moment he doesn't have to address why his choice for labor secretary has spent his career defending Wall Street banks and Walmart at the expense of workers. When he is launching attacks on the free press, he isn't talking about why his Environmental Protection Agency just refused to ban a pesticide linked to brain damage in children.\nHis efforts to pit religious minorities against one another stem from the same playbook. If working Americans are too busy fighting with one another, we will never address the very real and deep problems our country faces — from climate change to soaring inequality to lack of quality affordable health care.\nThe only way to push back is to be unequivocal about our values. It is not enough to condemn Mr. Trump's racism. We must affirmatively confront racist policies — whether the caging of immigrant children at the border or the banning of Muslim immigrants or the allowing of segregation in public housing. It is not enough to condemn the corruption and self-dealing of this administration. We must support policies that unmistakably improve working people's lives, including by strengthening collective bargaining, raising the minimum wage and pursuing a universal jobs guarantee.\nThe consequences of this fight will not just be felt here at home but around the world. Right-wing nationalism in Hungary, Russia, France, Britain and elsewhere is on the march in ways not seen in decades. America has been a beacon of democratic ideals for the world. If we succumb to the fever of right-wing nationalism, it will have consequences far beyond our borders.\nThe proudest moments in our history — from the Emancipation Proclamation to the civil rights movement to the struggle against fascism — have come when we fight to protect and expand basic democratic rights. Today, democracy is under attack once again.

The resulting federal court cases led to greater scrutiny of Clinton's private email server usage.[6]\n- The House Select Committee on Benghazi, which investigated how the State Department handled the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, requested information about the management of Clinton's private email server and communications related to Benghazi.[7]\n- In August 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation to determine whether classified documents were mishandled in relation to Clinton's private email server.[8]\nRegulations governing electronic document storage\nProtocol for the retention and security of official government documents is governed by several regulations: the Federal Records Act, guidelines issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Section 1924 under Title 18 of the United States Code.[14] Some of these rules were changed to more directly address electronic records after Clinton left her position as secretary of state in 2013.\nRegulations in place during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state\n- The Federal Records Act contains the following guidelines for record management:\n- The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) also offers guidance on record retention. In 1995, its regulations stipulated the following:\n- The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was created to \"foster democracy by ensuring public access to agency records and information.\"[19] Anyone can make a FOIA request for official government documents. If the information requested falls under one of nine exemption categories, it is not required to be disclosed. \"Information that is classified to protect national security\" is an example of an exemption category.[20]\n- 18 U.S.C. § 1924 makes it criminal for an employee or contractor of the United States to \"knowingly\" remove classified documents or retain them at \"an unauthorized location.\"[21]\nRegulations established after Clinton's tenure as secretary of state\nIn September 2013, NARA issued new guidance covering email usage. According to NARA, \"agency employees must ensure that all Federal records sent or received on personal email systems are captured and managed in accordance with agency recordkeeping practices.\"[22] The guidance also noted federal employees should not use personal email accounts for official business except where there is an emergency or issue with accessibility.[23]\nIn November 2014, President Barack Obama signed into law the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, which modernized regulations governing electronic document storage. The law updated the Federal Records Act to explicitly include electronic records in the definition of federal records and clarified the duties of federal officials who maintained non-government email systems.[24] One significant change in the law required federal employees who used \"a non-official electronic messaging account\" to copy the employee's official account when sending messages or forward the record no later than 20 days after it was created.[25]\nPotential liability\nClinton's potential criminal liability arose under 18 U.S.C. § 1924, the iss\nDoc 2(Title: Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations) Since the 1970s, at least 28 women have accused Donald Trump of various acts of sexual misconduct,[1] including rape, and kissing and groping without consent; looking under women's skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.

Johnny McMahan, 65, a GOP delegate from Arkansas, said he had no problem with a woman being president but some of his friends felt differently. “They say women are too emotional to be president,” McMahan said. Though assailing the opposing candidate is standard fare at political conventions, this year the attacks have transcended policy positions and become intimately personal. The relentless spotlight on an opponent’s supposed criminality is another departure. Republicans maintain Clinton broke the law by sending classified information on her private email server. Trump’s campaign has worked to sow distrust by using vague insinuations against Clinton that are hard to prove or disprove. On Wednesday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort mused that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had “probably” given special information to Bill Clinton that helped his wife avoid criminal charges, during a brief airport meeting that Lynch has acknowledged was a mistake. He said the “Lock her up!” chant punctuating speeches at the conventions “probably reflects the attitude of a lot of people in America.” “They don’t understand why justice wasn’t done,” he said.

Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean tow\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it appears that Hillary Clinton's private email server scandal and the controversy surrounding it have contributed significantly to negative public perception.
