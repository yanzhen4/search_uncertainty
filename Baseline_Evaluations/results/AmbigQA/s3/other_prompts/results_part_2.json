(The first two were Jamestown and Williamsburg.) It houses the\noldest elected legislative body in North America, the Virginia General\nAssembly, first established as the House of Burgesses in 1619. The Capitol was\nconceived of by Thomas Jefferson and Charles-Louis Clérisseau in France, based\non the Maison Carrée in Nimes. Construction began in 1785 and was completed in\n1788. The current Capitol is the eighth built to serve as Virginia's\nstatehouse, primarily due to fires during the Colonial period. In the early\n20th century, two wings were added, leading to its present appearance. In\n1960, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\n## History\n\n### Colonial precursors in Jamestown and Williamsburg\n\nDuring the American Colonial period, Virginia's first capital was Jamestown,\nwhere the first legislative body, the Virginia House of Burgesses, met in\n1619. The new government used four state houses at different times at\nJamestown due to fires. The first Representative Legislative Assembly convened\non July 30, 1619 at the Jamestown Church which served as the first Capitol.\nWith the decision to relocate the government inland to Williamsburg in 1699, a\ngrand new Capitol building was completed in November 1705. Nearby was the\ngrand Governor's Palace. It burned in 1747 and was replaced in 1753. On June\n29, 1776, Virginians declared their independence from Great Britain and wrote\nthe state's first constitution, thereby creating an independent government\nfour days before Congress voted for the Declaration of Independence in\nPhiladelphia on July 4. The Capitol at Williamsburg served until the American\nRevolutionary War began, when Governor Thomas Jefferson urged that the capital\nbe relocated to Richmond. The building was last used as a capitol on December\n24, 1779, when the Virginia General Assembly adjourned to reconvene in 1780 at\nthe new capital, Richmond. It was eventually destroyed.\n\n### Richmond and state capitol design\n\nWhen it convened in Richmond on May 1, 1780, the legislature met in a\nmakeshift building near Shockoe Bottom. By 1788, the \"Old Capitol\" where the\nVirginia Ratifying Convention met was at the New Academy by the Chevalier\nQuesnay. Plans were begun for a new building to serve a new state, the\nCommonwealth of Virginia. The site selected for a new, permanent building was\non Shockoe Hill, a major hill overlooking the falls of the James River. Thomas\nJefferson is credited with the overall design of the new Capitol, together\nwith French architect Charles-Louis Clérisseau. The design was modeled after\nthe Maison Carrée at Nîmes in southern France, an ancient Roman temple. The\nonly other state to accurately copy an ancient model is the Vermont State\nHouse, which based its portico on the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens.\nJefferson had Clérisseau substitute the Ionic order over the more ornate\nCorinthian column designs of the prototype in France. At the suggestion of\nClérisseau, it used a variant of the Ionic order designed by Italian student\nof Andrea Palladio, Vincenzo Scamozzi. The cornerstone was laid on August 18,\n1785, with Governor Patrick Henry in attendance, prior to the completion of\nits design. In 1786, a set of architectural drawings and a plaster model were\nsent from France to Virginia, where it was executed by Samuel Dobie. It was\nsufficiently completed for the General Assembly to meet there in October 1792.\nIt is one of only twelve Capitols in the United States without an external\ndome. (The others are the Capitols of Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii,\nLouisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio and Tennessee.)\n\n### American Civil War\n\nThe building also served as the Capitol of the Confederacy during the American\nCivil War (1861–65) (It was the Confederacy's second home, the first being the\nAlabama State\nDoc 2(Title: # Government of Virginia) \nThe government of Virginia combines the three branches of authority in the\nCommonwealth of Virginia. The current Governor of Virginia is Ralph Northam.\nThe State Capitol building in Richmond was designed by Thomas Jefferson, and\nthe cornerstone was laid by Governor Patrick Henry in 1785. Virginia currently\nfunctions under the 1971 Constitution of Virginia. It is the Commonwealth's\nseventh constitution. Under the Constitution, the government is composed of\nthree branches, the legislative, the executive and the judicial.\n\n## Executive branch\n\nThe statewide elected officials are governor, lieutenant governor, and\nattorney general. All three officers are separately elected four-year terms in\nyears following Presidential elections (1997, 2001, 2005, etc.) and take\noffice in January of the following year. Virginia is one of only five states\nthat elects its state officials in odd numbered years (the others are\nKentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and New Jersey). The last gubernatorial\nelection was in 2017, and the next will occur in 2021. The governor serves as\nchief executive officer of the Commonwealth and as commander-in-chief of its\nmilitia. The Constitution does not allow a governor to succeed himself in\noffice (though a governor is allowed to serve multiple non-consecutive terms).\nThe Lieutenant Governor, who is not elected on the same ticket as the\ngovernor, serves as president of the Senate of Virginia and is first in the\nline of succession to the governor. The Lieutenant Governor is allowed to run\nfor reelection. The Attorney General is chief legal advisor to the governor\nand the General Assembly, chief lawyer of the Commonwealth and the head of the\nDepartment of Law. The attorney general is second in the line of succession to\nthe governor. Whenever there is a vacancy in all three executive offices of\ngovernor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general, then the Speaker of the\nHouse of the Virginia House of Delegates becomes governor.\n\n### Cabinet\n\nThe Virginia Governor's Cabinet is a body of the most senior appointed\nofficers of the executive branch, responsible for advising the governor. It is\ncomposed of the following offices, nominated by the governor and then\npresented to the Virginia General Assembly for confirmation:\n\n  * Chief of Staff\n  * Deputy Chief of Staff\n  * Secretary of the Commonwealth\n  * Secretary of Administration\n  * Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry\n  * Secretary of Commerce and Trade\n  * Secretary of Education\n  * Secretary of Finance\n  * Secretary of Health and Human Resources\n  * Secretary of Natural Resources\n  * Secretary of Public Safety\n  * Secretary of Transportation\n  * Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security\n\nMany executive branch agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations.\nProposals to create or amend state regulations are often subject to review by\nthe executive branch.\n\n## Legislative branch\n\nThe legislative branch or state legislature is the General Assembly. The\nGeneral Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of a lower house, the Virginia\nHouse of Delegates, with 100 members, and an upper house, the Senate of\nVirginia, with 40 members. Combined together, the General Assembly consists of\n140 elected representatives from an equal number of constituent districts\nacross the commonwealth. The General Assembly holds sessions in the Virginia\nState Capitol in Richmond. The House of Delegates is presided over by the\nSpeaker of the House, while the Senate is presided over by the Lieutenant\nGovernor of Virginia. The House and Senate each elect a clerk and sergeant-at-\narms. The Senate of Virginia's clerk is known as the \"Clerk of the Senate\"\n(instead of as the \"Secretary of the Senate,\" the title used in the United\nStates Senate). The General Assembly also selects the Commonwealth's Auditor\nof Public Accounts. The statutory law enacted by the General Assembly is\ncodified in the Code of Virginia.\n\n## Judiciary\n\nThe judiciary of Virginia is defined u\nDoc 3(Title: r 30, 1991: A. L.

It is still used for ceremonial ringing.\n  * Oliver Hill Building (1892-1894)\n\n## In film and television\n\nGiven its Classical Revival style of architecture along with the fact that its\ncolor is white, the Capitol was the double for the exterior shots of The White\nHouse featured in the movie The Contender (2000) starring Gary Oldman, Jeff\nBridges, Christian Slater. In the 1993 comedy-drama film Dave with Kevin\nKline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella; the House of Delegates chamber served\nas the set for the United States House of Representatives, where the title\ncharacter President addresses a joint session of Congress.

Because the electricity had been turned off in the State House due to\nthe flooding, there was no air conditioning in the capitol.\n\n## The building\n\n### The exterior\n\nThe original core of the building, as well as the subsequent additions, is\nessentially Greek Revival in style. The 1851 three-story core of the building\nfeatures bays delineated by Doric pilasters and a monumental three-story\nhexastyle portico utilizing the Composite order. The original core of the\nbuilding is , with an original central rear judiciary wing measuring . The\nfirst extension to the rear added another . Each side-wing is . The additions\nstarted with an extension to the east wing on the building's rear facade in\n1885. Then a south wing with Beaux-Arts influences was added in 1906. An\nexternally identical north wing was completed in 1912. The matching side-wings\nwere designed by Montgomery architect Frank Lockwood, in consultation with\nCharles Follen McKim of McKim, Mead & White. The symmetrical north and south\nside-wings are each joined to the 1851 structure with a hyphen. Each hyphen\nfeatures a recessed two-story Ionic portico on the west facade. Both of the\nadjoining side-wings feature two-story hexastyle Ionic entrance porticoes on\ntheir north and south elevations, respectively. The west and east facades of\nthese wings also feature decorative two-story hexastyle pseudo-porticoes with\nengaged Ionic columns. A new east wing addition with a new three-story\ntetrastyle portico was built during the 1985–92 restoration. The new portico\nincludes columns that match the Composite order originals of the main entrance\nportico on the 1851 west elevation.\n\n### The interior\n\nUpon entering the ground floor of the capitol building, one enters the main\nstair-hall. It is the location of cantilevered stairways that spiral up to the\nthird floor. The twin cantilevered spiral staircases are among the building's\nfinest original architectural features. They were designed and built by\narchitect Horace King, a former slave who was freed in 1846. Due to his renown\nin Alabama and surrounding states as a bridge builder, the Alabama Legislature\npassed a special law that exempted him from the state's manumission laws,\nwhich normally required that freed slaves leave the state within one year of\ngaining their freedom. During the post-war Reconstruction Era he served two\nterms in the Alabama House of Representatives, in the building that he had\nhelped to design and build. Immediately east of the stair-hall is the ground\nfloor of the rotunda. The ground floor of the rotunda, not physically open to\nthe upper rotunda floors, contains the memorial sculpture Lurleen Burns\nWallace (1968) by F. R. Schoenfeld. Wallace was Alabama's first female\ngovernor and died while in office in 1968. From there, hallways leading to\noffices branch off into the north and south wings. The next major room on the\nground floor is the old Supreme Court Chamber, part of the original capitol\nplan. Located in the east (rear) wing, it is the only portion of the wing\ndating back to 1851. It is a large rectangular room, one story high, with a\nconcave entry wall and two robust Ionic columns visually dividing the space\nnear the center of the room. Later east wing expansions continue on eastward\nfrom this room. The second floor is accessed via the main stairhall. From\nthere the open rotunda is accessed to the east. The rotunda leads to the east\nwing offices, the old Senate Chamber to the north and the old House of\nRepresentatives Chamber to the south. The interior of the capitol building is\ncentered on the axial rotunda, which is topped by a large dome. The rotunda is\nopen from the second floor and through the third floor to the top of the dome.\nThe dome interior is decorated with eight painted murals by Roderick\nMac\nDoc 5(Title: # New Jersey State House) \nThe New Jersey State House is located in Trenton and is the capitol building\nfor the U.S. state of New Jersey. Built in 1790, it is the third-oldest state\nhouse in continuous legislative use in the United States; only the Maryland\nState Capitol in Annapolis and the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond are\nolder. The building houses both chambers of the Legislature (the Senate and\nthe General Assembly), as well as offices for the Governor, Lieutenant\nGovernor and several state government departments. The building is the closest\ncapitol building to a state border of any state capitol, with the bridge to\nPennsylvania being within walking distance a few blocks away.\n\n## History\n\nAfter the Legislature relocated to Trenton from Perth Amboy in 1790, it\npurchased land for £250 and 5 shillings. Construction on the new state house,\ndesigned by Philadelphia-based architect Jonathan Doane, began in 1792. The\nDoane building was covered in stucco, measured and housed the senate and house\nchambers in opposite wings. To meet the demands of the growing state, the\nstructure was expanded several times during the 19th century, by noted\narchitects such as John Notman of Philadelphia who created office wing on\nnorth side in 1845 and Samuel Sloan, also of Philadelphia who designed new\nwings to house both legislative chambers in 1871. On March 21, 1885, a large\nfire destroyed the State Street wing. Lewis Broome, of Jersey City led the\nreconstruction of the building. He used a rare pigmented brick from the\nLippincott Brick Co. of Farmingdale. The brick used was a one-of-a-kind color\nfor the region. Merchantville architect Arnold Moses reconstructed the Senate\nwing in the American Renaissance style. The New Jersey State House attained\nits current size in 1911 when a four-story office block replaced the original\n1792 structure. The only major change since has been modernization of the main\ncorridor in 1950. A 1960 plan, called for the replacement of the oldest\nsections of the structure with modern legislative chambers, however it was\nnever implemented.\n\n### Renovation\n\nA renovation project began in 1987. The project restored the legislative\nsection of the building and upgraded mechanical and electrical systems in the\nbuilding. This began an ongoing effort to restore the oldest portions of the\nbuilding. A complete restoration of the building began in 2017 and is expected\nto be completed in 2020.\n\n## Design\n\nThe New Jersey State House is unusual among state capitol buildings in the\nUnited States, the majority of which are reminiscent of the US Capitol. The\nbuilding consists of two parallel structures connected by the dome-capped\nrotunda, resembling the letter H, with its long arm parallel to State Street.\nA long portico wing, added by Notman and subsequently enlarged, extends west\nfrom the rotunda toward the Delaware River. To this portico, a number of\narchitecturally dissimilar, unusually-shaped structures have been added. These\nstructures have been the subject of subsequent renovations to blend them with\nthe original wing. The State House is set not on a park-like campus, as are\nmany state houses, rather it is integrated into an urban setting along\nhistoric State Street and is surrounded by other legislative buildings. The\nmost scenic view of the building is from the west, near the Delaware River,\nand is the side dominated by the various additions. Viewed from State Street,\nthe dome is scarcely visible and there is little sense of the scale or design\nof the building. The Governor's office occupies the remaining portion of the\noriginal 1792 State House. Tours are offered daily Monday through Saturday,\nexcept state holidays. The tours typically include the Senate and Assembly\nchambers galleries, party conference rooms, the rotunda and Governor's Office\nreception room.

    "question": "Where did the portuguese establish brazilian sugar plantations?",
    "agent_answer": "<answer> The Portuguese established Brazilian sugar plantations primarily along the northeastern coast of Brazil, particularly in areas such as Pernambuco, Bahia, and São Paulo. This decision was influenced by the success of sugar production in the Portuguese-controlled islands of Madeira and São Tomé, where they had already established plantation economies using forced labor. The northeastern region of Brazil offered similar environmental conditions suitable for growing sugarcane, leading to the establishment of large sugar plantations in the 16th and 17th centuries. These plantations relied heavily on the labor of enslaved Africans, who were brought to Brazil to work on the sugar estates. The economic importance of sugar production in Brazil grew significantly, becoming the country's most valuable export by the mid-16th century, driven by both domestic and international demand. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo answer where the Portuguese established Brazilian sugar plantations, I need to consider the historical context and geographical factors.

During\nthe early 300 years of Brazilian colonial history, the economic exploitation\nof the territory was based first on brazilwood (pau brazil) extraction (16th\ncentury), which gave the territory its name; sugar production (16th–18th\ncenturies); and finally on gold and diamond mining (18th century). Slaves,\nespecially those brought from Africa, provided most of the work force of the\nBrazilian export economy after a brief period of Indian slavery to cut\nbrazilwood. In contrast to the neighboring Spanish possessions, which had\nseveral viceroyalties with jurisdiction initially over New Spain (Mexico) and\nPeru, and in the eighteenth century expanded to viceroyalties of Rio de la\nPlata and New Granada, the Portuguese colony of Brazil was settled mainly in\nthe coastal area by the Portuguese and a large black slave population working\nsugar plantations and mines. The boom and bust economic cycles were linked to\nexport products. Brazil's sugar age, with the development of plantation\nslavery, merchants serving as middle men between production sites, Brazilian\nports, and Europe was undermined by the growth of the sugar industry in the\nCaribbean on islands that European powers seized from Spain. Gold and diamonds\nwere discovered and mined in southern Brazil through the end of the colonial\nera. Brazilian cities were largely port cities and the colonial administrative\ncapital was moved several times in response to the rise and fall of export\nproducts' importance. Unlike Spanish America, which fragmented into many\nrepublics upon independence, Brazil remained a single administrative unit\nunder a monarch, giving rise to the largest country in Latin America. Just as\nEuropean Spanish and Roman Catholicism were a core source of cohesion among\nSpain's vast and multi-ethnic territories, Brazilian society was united by the\nPortuguese language and Roman Catholic faith. As the only Lusophone polity in\nthe Western Hemisphere, the Portuguese language was particularly important to\nBrazilian identity.\n\n## Initial European contact and early colonial history (1494–1530)\n\nPortugal pioneered the European charting of sea routes that were the first and\nonly channels of interaction between all of the world's continents, thus\nbeginning the process of globalization. In addition to the imperial and\neconomic undertaking of discovery and colonization of lands distant from\nEurope, these years were filled with pronounced advancements in cartography,\nshipbuilding and navigational instruments, of which the Portuguese explorers\ntook advantage. In 1494, the two kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula divided the\nNew World between them (in the Treaty of Tordesillas), and in 1500 navigator\nPedro Álvares Cabral landed in what is now Brazil and laid claim to it in the\nname of King Manuel I of Portugal. The Portuguese identified brazilwood as a\nvaluable red dye and an exploitable product, and attempted to force indigenous\ngroups in Brazil to cut the trees.\n\n### The Age of Exploration\n\nPortuguese seafarers in the early fifteenth century, as an extension of the\nPortuguese Reconquista, began to expand from a small area of the Iberian\nPeninsula, to seizing the Muslim fortress of Ceuta in North Africa. Its\nmaritime exploration then proceeded down the coast of West Africa and across\nthe Indian Ocean to the south Asian subcontinent, as well as the Atlantic\nislands off the coast of Africa on the way. They sought sources of gold,\nivory, and African slaves, high value goods in the African trade. The\nPortuguese set up fortified trading \"factories\" (feitorias), whereby\npermanent, fairly small commercial settlements anchored trade in a region. The\ninitial costs of setting up these commercial posts was borne by private\ninvestors, who in turn received hereditary t\nDoc 2(Title: # Engenho) \nEngenho () is a colonial-era Portuguese term for a sugar cane mill and the\nassociated facilities. In Spanish-speaking countries such as Cuba and Puerto\nRico, they are called ingenios. The word engenho usually only referred to the\nmill, but it could also describe the area as a whole including land, a mill,\nthe people who farmed and who had a knowledge of sugar production, and a crop\nof sugar cane. A large estate was required because of the massive amount of\nlabor needed to yield refined sugar, molasses, or rum from raw sugar cane.\nThese estates were prevalent in Brazil, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and other\ncountries in the Caribbean. Today, Brazil is still one of the world's major\nproducers of sugar.\n\n## Sugarcane in Brazil\n\nSugarcane was not introduced to Brazil until the Portuguese established the\nproduction of it in the middle of the 16th century. They controlled the\nleading sugar industry in Madeira already, but they wanted to gain another\npowerhouse production base in Brazil. To start out, the crop was grown and\nproduced by the indigenous people of the land for traded goods. That\nrelationship evolved from trade to slavery of the indigenous population. Many\nplaces in the world had begun to substitute honey for sugar as a major\ncommodity due to the supply increase and lower prices. Sugar became a luxury\nitem on the world market because of it exploited coerced labor demand and the\nindustrial organization that were both imperative to production. The native\npopulation were not really adhering to the slavery aspect and were hard to\nkeep under control, so as the market for sugar grew these factors caused the\neventual import of African slaves.\n\n## The Engenho\n\nThe export boom of the late 18th and early 19th century cause a ramp up in the\nproduction of sugar and other sugarcane products as well as other resources.\nThe sugar portion of the export boom increased supply until slavery was made\nillegal in the world. However, the slave trade continued into the latter part\nof the 19th century. Haiti's slave revolt allowed Brazil among other colonies\nto become the top producers of the world's sugar. In 1792, Haiti was producing\n50% of the sugar on the world market, but after the rebellion they went to\nproducing none the next year. They main location site the sugarcane work took\nplace were large plantations called an Engenho. An Engenho is an agricultural\nestablishment as necessary machines and resources for refining sugar from\nsugarcane. The facilities typically have a mill for milling cane, some\ncauldrons and distilleries. They acquired the name because of all their\ncomponents used to produce and develop the sugarcane into potential exports.\nEngenhos could be considered revolutionary at the time because of its\nindustrial advancement, the work combined manufacturing, chemistry, and\nagriculture to mass produce sugar. This new industrialized plantation required\nmany working parts to keep it running. An engenho needed a field, workshop,\nrefinery, and office just to produce the sugar. The list did not take account\nfor the needs to power the building or slave requirements and needs. To run\nthe Engenho specialized slaves and servants were necessary. The overseer had\nto be a free white, while the slaves purchased needed to be strong field hands\nand some already familiar with the sugar production process. They were\nsometimes imported from Sao Tome in Africa because of the country's history as\nmajor world sugar producers which allowed for the workers from there to\nalready have the artisan skills needed for the sugarcane production. These\nlarge sugar plantations required a new division of labor among the overseers\nand slaves. the overseers had power on the plantation but were not all\npowerful, the planter was. For example, the overseer could not just punish\nslaves however he wanted to, he had limitations. His main job was to make sure\nall the supplies needed where there and to keep a list of what the planter had\nto get. The overseer was to\nDoc 3(Title: he first two centuries of colonization,) Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing\nopportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other. By the\nmid-16th century, cane sugar had become Brazil's most important export, and\nslaves purchased in Sub-Saharan Africa, in the slave market of Western Africa\n(not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in Angola and\nMozambique), had become its largest import, to cope with plantations of\nsugarcane, due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar. By the\nend of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline, and the discovery\nof gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the\ncolony's economy, fostering a Brazilian Gold Rush which attracted thousands of\nnew settlers to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the\nworld. This increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts\nbetween newcomers and old settlers. Portuguese expeditions known as Bandeiras\ngradually advanced the Portugal colonial original frontiers in South America\nto approximately the current Brazilian borders. In this era other European\npowers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese\nhad to fight, notably the French in Rio during the 1560s, in Maranhão during\nthe 1610s, and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco, during the Dutch–Portuguese\nWar, after the end of Iberian Union. The Portuguese colonial administration in\nBrazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of\nPortugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate\nall forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the Quilombo of Palmares,\nand to repress all movements for autonomy or independence, such as the Minas\nConspiracy.\n\n### United Kingdom with Portugal\n\nIn late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of\ncontinental Portugal, causing Prince Regent João, in the name of Queen Maria\nI, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. There they\nestablished some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local\nstock exchanges, and its National Bank, additionally ending the Portuguese\nmonopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil to other nations. In 1809, in\nretaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the\nPortuguese conquest of French Guiana. With the end of the Peninsular War in\n1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João\nreturn to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European\nmonarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in\nBrazil, where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established\nthe United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, thus creating a\npluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state. However, the leadership in\nPortugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to\ndemand the return of court to Lisbon (v. Liberal Revolution of 1820). In 1821,\nacceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto, D.\nJoão VI departed for Lisbon. There he swore an oath to the new constitution,\nleaving his son, Prince Pedro de Alcântara, as Regent of the Kingdom of\nBrazil.\n\n### Independent empire\n\nTensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased, and the Portuguese\nCortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 Liberal\nRevolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony. The Brazilians refused\nto yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's\nindependence from Portugal on 7 September 1822. A month later, Prince Pedro\nwas declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro I,\nresulting in the foundation of the Empire of Brazil. The Brazilian War of\nIndependence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the\nnorthern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province. The last Portuguese\nsoldiers surre\nDoc 4(Title: he promise of freedom for fighting. On the) Portuguese side, one name comes down in history, Henrique Dias, who was\nawarded noble status by the monarch, but not the knighthood in the Order of\nChrist as promised.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of the Dutch occupation, Portuguese settled scores with\nAmerindians who had supported the Dutch. There were tensions between\nPortuguese who had fled the area under occupation and those who had lived\nunder Dutch occupation. The returnees attempted to litigate so as to regain\nthe properties they had abandoned, which in this sugar-producing area included\nsugar mills and other buildings, as well as cane fields. The litigation\ndragged on for years. The conflict in Brazil's northeast had severe economic\nconsequences. Both sides had practiced a scorched earth policy that disrupted\nsugar production, and the war had diverted Portuguese funds from being\ninvested in the colonial economy. After the war, Portuguese authorities were\nforced to spend their tax revenues on rebuilding Recife. The sugar industry in\nPernambuco never fully recovered from the Dutch occupation, being surpassed by\nsugar production in Bahia. Meanwhile, the British, French, and Dutch Caribbean\nhad become a major competitor to Brazilian sugar due to rising sugar prices in\nthe 1630s and 1640s. After the WIC evacuated Pernambuco, the Dutch brought\ntheir expertise and capital to the Caribbean instead. In the 1630s, Brazil\nprovided 80% of the sugar sold in London, while it only provided 10% by 1690.\nThe Portuguese colony of Brazil did not recover economically until the\ndiscovery of gold in southern Brazil during the 18th century. The Dutch period\nin Brazil was \"a historical parenthesis with few lasting traces\" in the social\nsphere. That said, Dutch artistic production in Brazil, particularly by Albert\nEckhout and Frans Post left an important visual record of Brazilian people and\nplaces in the early seventeenth century.\n\n### Peace treaty\n\nSeven years after the surrender of Recife, a peace treaty was organized\nbetween the Dutch Republic and Portugal. The Treaty of The Hague (1661) was\nsigned on August 6, 1661, and it demanded that the Portuguese would pay 4\nmillion réis over the span of 16 years in order to help the Dutch recover from\nthe loss of Brazil.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Colonial Brazil\n  * Dutch West India Company\n  * Dutch Brazilian\n  * 17th century Dutch Brazil:\n    * Georg Marcgrave\n    * Willem Piso\n    * Caspar Barlaeus\n    * Frans Post\n    * Albert Eckhout\n    * Zacharias Wagenaer\n    * Isaac Aboab da Fonseca\n    * Historia Naturalis Brasiliae (1648)\n    * Battle of Tabocas (1645)\n  * Recife and Pernambuco:\n    * Ricardo Brennand Institute\n  * Others:\n    * France Antarctique\n    * Equinoctial France\n    * History of Suriname\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n      * Barlaeus, The History of Brazil Under the Governorship of Count Johan Maurits of Nassau, 1636-1644.

The) Portuguese set up fortified trading \"factories\" (feitorias), whereby\npermanent, fairly small commercial settlements anchored trade in a region. The\ninitial costs of setting up these commercial posts was borne by private\ninvestors, who in turn received hereditary titles and commercial advantages.\nFrom the Portuguese Crown's point of view, its realm was expanded with\nrelatively little cost to itself. On the Atlantic islands of the Azores,\nMadeira, and Sāo Tomé, the Portuguese began plantation production of sugarcane\nusing forced labor, a precedent for Brazil's sugar production in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries. The Portuguese \"discovery\" of Brazil was preceded\nby a series of treaties between the kings of Portugal and Castile, following\nPortuguese sailings down the coast of Africa to India and the voyages to the\nCaribbean of the Genoese mariner sailing for Castile, Christopher Columbus.\nThe most decisive of these treaties was the Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in\n1494, which created the Tordesillas Meridian, dividing the world between the\ntwo kingdoms. All land discovered or to be discovered east of that meridian\nwas to be the property of Portugal, and everything to the west of it went to\nSpain. The Tordesillas Meridian divided South America into two parts, leaving\na large chunk of land to be exploited by the Spaniards. The Treaty of\nTordesillas was arguably the most decisive event in all Brazilian history,\nsince it determined that part of South America would be settled by Portugal\ninstead of Spain. The present extent of Brazil's coastline is almost exactly\nthat defined by the Treaty of Madrid, which was approved in 1750.\n\n### Arrival and early exploitation\n\nOn April 22, 1500, during the reign of King Manuel I, a fleet led by navigator\nPedro Álvares Cabral landed in Brazil and took possession of the land in the\nname of the king. Although it is debated whether previous Portuguese explorers\nhad already been in Brazil, this date is widely and politically accepted as\nthe day of the discovery of Brazil by Europeans. The place where Álvares\nCabral arrived is now known as Porto Seguro (\"safe harbor\"), in Northeastern\nBrazil. Cabral was leading a large fleet of 13 ships and more than 1000 men\nfollowing Vasco da Gama's way to India, around Africa. Cabral was able to\nsafely enter and leave Brazil in ten days, despite having no means of\ncommunication with the indigenous people there, due to the experience\nPortuguese explorers, such as de Gama, had been amassing over the past few\ndecades in interacting with foreign peoples. The Portuguese colonization,\naround 80 years earlier, of islands off of West Africa such as São Tomé and\nPríncipe, were the first examples of the Portuguese monarchy beginning to move\nfrom a crusading and looting-centric attitude, to a trade-centric attitude\nwhen approaching new lands. The latter attitude required communication and\ncooperation with indigenous people, thus, interpreters. This informed Cabral's\nactions in Brazil. As Cabral realized that no one in his convoy spoke the\nlanguage of the indigenous people in Brazil, he took every effort to avoid\nviolence and conflict and used music and humor as forms of communication. Just\na few months before Cabral landed, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón came to the\nnortheastern coast of Brazil and deployed many armed men ashore with no means\nof communicating with the indigenous people. One of his ships and captains was\ncaptured by indigenous people and eight of his men were killed. Cabral no\ndoubt learned from this to treat communication with the utmost priority.\nCabral left two degredados (criminal exiles) in Brazil to learn the native\nlanguages and to serve as interpreters in the future. The practice of leaving\ndegredados in new lands to serve as interpreters in the future came straight\nfrom the colonization of the islands off of the West African coast 80 years\nbefore Cabral landed in Brazil. After the voyage of Álvares Cabral, the\nPortuguese\n</information>\n\n\n<answer> The Portuguese established Brazilian sugar plantations primarily along the northeastern coast of Brazil, particularly in areas such as Pernambuco, Bahia, and São Paulo. This decision was influenced by the success of sugar production in the Portuguese-controlled islands of Madeira and São Tomé, where they had already established plantation economies using forced labor. The northeastern region of Brazil offered similar environmental conditions suitable for growing sugarcane, leading to the establishment of large sugar plantations in the 16th and 17th centuries. These plantations relied heavily on the labor of enslaved Africans, who were brought to Brazil to work on the sugar estates. The economic importance of sugar production in Brazil grew significantly, becoming the country's most valuable export by the mid-16th century, driven by both domestic and international demand. </answer>"

    "question": "Who sang the song a change is going to come?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, the song \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" was sung by Sam Cooke. It was initially released on his album \"Ain't That Good News\" in February 1964 and later issued as a single on December 22, 1964. The song was inspired by an incident where Cooke and his entourage were denied accommodation at a whites-only motel in Louisiana, which deeply affected him and motivated him to write a song addressing racial struggles and the Civil Rights Movement.",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<search>who sang a change is going to come</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: # A Change Is Gonna Come) \n\"A Change Is Gonna Come\" is a song by American recording artist Sam Cooke. It\ninitially appeared on Cooke's album Ain't That Good News, released mid-\nFebruary 1964 by RCA Victor; a slightly edited version of the recording was\nreleased as a single on December 22, 1964. Produced by Hugo & Luigi and\narranged and conducted by René Hall, the song was the B-side to \"Shake\". The\nsong was inspired by various personal events in Cooke's life, most prominently\nan event in which he and his entourage were turned away from a whites-only\nmotel in Louisiana. Cooke felt compelled to write a song that spoke to his\nstruggle and of those around him, and that pertained to the Civil Rights\nMovement and African Americans. The song contains the refrain, \"It's been a\nlong time coming, but I know a change is gonna come.\" Though only a modest hit\nfor Cooke in comparison with his previous singles, \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" is\nwidely considered Cooke's best composition and has been voted among the best\nsongs ever released by various publications. In 2007, the song was selected\nfor preservation in the Library of Congress, with the National Recording\nRegistry deeming the song \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically\nimportant.\"\n\n## Background\n\nOn October 8, 1963, en route to Shreveport, Louisiana, Cooke called ahead to\nthe Holiday Inn North to make reservations for his wife, Barbara, and himself,\nbut when he and his group arrived, the desk clerk glanced nervously and\nexplained there were no vacancies. While his brother Charles protested, Sam\nwas furious, yelling to see the manager and refusing to leave until he\nreceived an answer. His wife nudged him, attempting to calm him down, telling\nhim, \"They'll kill you,\" to which he responded, \"They ain't gonna kill me,\nbecause I'm Sam Cooke.\" When they eventually persuaded Cooke to leave, the\ngroup drove away calling out insults and blaring their horns. When they\narrived at the Castle Motel on Sprague Street downtown, the police were\nwaiting for them, arresting them for disturbing the peace. The New York Times\nran a UPI report the next day, headlined \"Negro Band Leader Held in\nShreveport,\" but African-Americans were outraged. In 2019, then-Shreveport\nmayor Adrian Perkins apologized to Cooke's family for the event, and\nposthumously awarded Cooke the key to the city. In addition, upon hearing Bob\nDylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" in 1963, Cooke was greatly moved that such a\npoignant song about racism in America could come from someone who was not\nblack, and was also ashamed he had not yet written something like that\nhimself. However, his image and fears of losing his largely white fan base\nprevented him from doing so. Cooke loved the song so much it was immediately\nincorporated into his repertoire.\n\n## Recording and production\n\nFollowing Christmas 1963, Cooke invited J.W. Alexander to his home to preview\na new song he had just written, one Cooke was very excited about. When he\narrived, Cooke ran through the number on his guitar twice, the second time\ngoing over it line by line. Both were very excited to record the song, with\nAlexander viewing it as more personal and political than anything he had yet\nattempted. He warned Cooke that he may not profit off the song as he had with\nlighter, poppier songs, but Cooke did not care. He explained to Alexander that\nhe hoped the song would make his father proud. \"It was less work than any song\nhe'd ever written,\" biographer Peter Guralnick says. \"It almost scared him\nthat the song — it was almost as if the song were intended for somebody else.\nHe grabbed it out of the air and it came to him whole, despite the fact that\nin many ways it's probably the most complex song that he wrote. It was both\nsingular — in the sense that you started out, 'I was born by the river' — but\nit also told the story both of a generation and of a people.\" Cooke handed the\nsong to his arranger René Hall, with no specific instructions as to what he\npersonally wanted, but to give it\nDoc 2(Title: ews\", and perform \"Change\" instead,) feeling that that was the statement he needed to make before a national\naudience. Cooke objected, noting that the album’s release was a month away and\nthat he had no time to pull together an arrangement within such a short time\nframe. Klein arranged for RCA to pay for a full string section and Cooke\nperformed the song that Friday on The Tonight Show after performing \"Basin\nStreet\". An NBC timekeeper logged down the number as \"It's a Long Time\nComing,\" but the network did not save the tape of the performance. Klein and\nAlexander both felt it would become a milestone moment in Cooke's career, but\nit was overshadowed by the Beatles' performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS\njust two days later. The song was issued on March 1 as a track on Cooke's\nalbum Ain't That Good News. It would not be issued as a single for another\nnine months. Cooke elected not to perform \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" again in\nhis lifetime, both because of the complexity of the arrangement and because of\nthe ominous nature of the song. When shown to his protégé Bobby Womack, his\nresponse was that it sounds \"like death.\" Cooke responded, \"Man, that's kind\nof how it sounds like to me. That's why I'm never going to play it in public.\"\nWomack clarified his thoughts, that it wasn’t deathly, but rather \"spooky,\"\nbut Cooke never performed the song again. In December, \"A Change Is Gonna\nCome\" was prepared for single release, with the verse and chorus preceding the\nbridge (\"I go to the movies…\") deleted for radio airplay. The civil rights\nmovement picked up on \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with near immediacy. On\nDecember 11, 1964, two weeks before the song was released, Sam Cooke was\nfatally shot at a Los Angeles motel.\n\n## Legacy\n\n\"A Change Is Gonna Come\" became an anthem for the Civil Rights Movement, and\nis widely considered Cooke's best composition. Over the years, the song has\ngarnered significant praise and, in 2005, was voted number 12 by\nrepresentatives of the music industry and press in Rolling Stone magazine's\n500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and voted number 3 in the webzine Pitchfork\nMedia's The 200 Greatest Songs of the 60s. The song is also among three\nhundred songs deemed the most important ever recorded by National Public Radio\n(NPR) and was selected by the Library of Congress as one of twenty-five\nselected recordings to the National Recording Registry as of March 2007.\nAcclaimed Music ranked it as the 46th greatest song of all time, as well as\nthe third best song of 1964. NPR called the song \"one of the most important\nsongs of the civil rights era.\" In 2007, the song was selected for\npreservation in the Library of Congress, with the National Recording Registry\ndeeming the song \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important.\" In\n2019, then-Shreveport mayor Adrian Perkins apologized to Cooke's family for\nthe Shreveport event (see above under Background), and posthumously awarded\nCooke the key to the city. The words “A change is gonna come” are on a wall of\nthe Contemplative Court, a space for reflection in the Smithsonian's National\nMuseum of African American History and Culture; the museum opened in 2016.\n\n### In other media\n\nThe song has served as a sample for rappers Ghostface Killah (1996), Ja Rule\n(2003), Papoose (2006), Lil Wayne (2007) \"Long Time Coming (remix)\" Charles\nHamilton, Asher Roth, B.o.B (2009), Nas's It Was Written album also features a\nsimilar opening as the song, On their album The Reunion hip-hop artists\nCapone-N-Noreaga used an excerpt from the song on the opening track which\nshares the same title as the Cooke original, and Bizzle (2011). After winning\nthe 2008 United States presidential election, Barack Obama referred to the\nsong, stating to his supporters in Chicago, \"It's been a long time coming, but\ntonight, change has come to America.\" A duet of the song by Bettye LaVette and\nJon Bon Jovi was included in . In Washington DC, in the days leading up to the\nInauguration of Barack Obama, this son\nDoc 3(Title: # I Am Changing) \n\"I Am Changing\" is a song from the second act of the long-running Broadway\nmusical Dreamgirls. Written by Henry Krieger and Tom Eyen, the song was\nperformed by the character Effie White, originally portrayed on Broadway by\nJennifer Holliday.\n\n## History\n\n\"I Am Changing\" tells the story of a woman who wants to leave behind the\nmistakes of her past and \"change her life\"--she sings, \"I need you, I need a\nhand\" and \"I need a friend to help me start all over again\". After the\nunexpected success of Holliday's first single, \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not\nGoing\", \"I Am Changing\" was released as the second single from the Dreamgirls\ncast album. However, the song didn't perform as well as \"And I Am Telling You\nI'm Not Going\", peaking at #22 on Billboard's Black Singles Chart and failing\nto chart on Billboard's Pop Singles Chart.\n\n## Cover versions\n\n\"I Am Changing\" has been covered several times. Whitney Houston performed the\nsong at the 10th Anniversary of Arista Records ceremony in 1984. This\nperformance is included on her 2010 CD/DVD reissue of Whitney Houston – The\nDeluxe Anniversary Edition. She also performed the song during the duration of\nher Greatest Love World Tour in 1986 in a slower, soulful version, influenced\nby gospel music. Ex-Supreme Mary Wilson included it in her album Walk the\nLine, and in a compilation of her solo singles. Lillias White, who was\nHolliday's original understudy, has performed the song in concert. Jennifer\nHudson performs the song as Effie White in the 2006 DreamWorks/Paramount\nDreamgirls motion picture adaptation. The song was performed by Bianca Ryan on\nthe first season of NBC's America's Got Talent, a reality show which Ryan\nbecame the winner of that year. The eleven-year-old's performance of \"I Am\nChanging\" prompted show judge (and onetime teen star) Brandy to shake her head\nand proclaim that Ryan \"makes me want to go practice … that's how good you\nare.\" In 2014, the song was performed in the Glee episode \"New Directions\" by\nKurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley).\n\n## References\n\n## External links\nDoc 4(Title: # The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)) \n\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" is a song written by Bob Dylan and released as\nthe title track of his 1964 album of the same name. Dylan wrote the song as a\ndeliberate attempt to create an anthem of change for the time, influenced by\nIrish and Scottish ballads. Released as a 45-rpm single in Britain in 1965, it\nreached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart. Ever since its release the song has\nbeen influential to people's views on society, with critics noting the general\nyet universal lyrics as contributing to the song's lasting message of change.\nDylan has occasionally performed it in concert. The song has been covered by\nmany different artists, including Nina Simone, the Byrds, the Seekers, Peter,\nPaul and Mary, Simon & Garfunkel, Runrig, the Beach Boys, Joan Baez, Phil\nCollins, Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, and Burl Ives. The song was ranked\nnumber 59 on Rolling Stone's 2004 list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All\nTime\".\n\n## Inspiration and composition\n\nDylan appears to have written the song in September and October 1963. He\nrecorded it as a Witmark publishing demo at that time, a version that was\nlater released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased)\n1961–1991. The song was then recorded at the Columbia studios in New York on\nOctober 23 and 24; the latter session yielded the version that became the\ntitle song of Dylan's third album. The a- in the song title is an archaic\nintensifying prefix, as in the British songs \"A-Hunting We Will Go\" and \"Here\nWe Come a-Wassailing\", from the 18th and 19th century. Dylan recalled writing\nthe song as a deliberate attempt to create an anthem of change for the moment.\nIn 1985, he told Cameron Crowe, \"This was definitely a song with a purpose. It\nwas influenced of course by the Irish and Scottish ballads ...'Come All Ye\nBold Highway Men', 'Come All Ye Tender Hearted Maidens'. I wanted to write a\nbig song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic\nway. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close\nfor a while and allied together at that time.\" Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin\nrecounts how Tony Glover stopped by Dylan's apartment in September 1963,\npicked up a page of the song Dylan was working on, and read a line from it:\n\"Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call.\" \"Turning to Dylan, Glover\nsaid, 'What is this shit, man?' Dylan shrugged his shoulders and replied,\n'Well, you know, it seems to be what the people want to hear. The critic\nMichael Gray called it \"the archetypal protest song.\" Gray commented, \"Dylan's\naim was to ride upon the unvoiced sentiment of a mass public—to give that\ninchoate sentiment an anthem and give its clamour an outlet. He succeeded, but\nthe language of the song is nevertheless imprecisely and very generally\ndirected.\" Gray suggested that the song has been outdated by the very changes\nthat it gleefully predicted and hence was politically out of date almost as\nsoon as it was written. The lyrics reflected his views on social injustices\nand the government’s unhelpful attitude towards change. The literary critic\nChristopher Ricks suggested that the song transcends the political\npreoccupations of the time in which it was written. Ricks argued in 2003 that\nDylan was still performing the song, and when he sang \"Your sons and your\ndaughters / Are beyond your command\", he sang inescapably with the accents not\nof a son, no longer perhaps primarily a parent, but with the attitude of a\ngrandfather. Ricks concluded, \"Once upon a time it may have been a matter of\nurging square people to accept the fact that their children were, you know,\nhippies. But the capacious urging could then come to mean that ex-hippie\nparents had better accept that their children look like becoming yuppies. And\nthen Republicans...\" Critic Andy Gill points out that the song's lyrics echo\nlines from the Book of Ecclesiastes, which Pete Seeger adapted to create his\nanthem \"Turn, Turn, Turn!\". The climact\nDoc 5(Title: ck Obama referred to the) song, stating to his supporters in Chicago, \"It's been a long time coming, but\ntonight, change has come to America.\" A duet of the song by Bettye LaVette and\nJon Bon Jovi was included in . In Washington DC, in the days leading up to the\nInauguration of Barack Obama, this song could be heard played constantly in\nthe city centre. In 2004, Patti LaBelle performed the song on the annual Nobel\nPeace Prize Concert to a standing ovation. On June 1, 2013, Beyoncé Knowles\nsang the song during The Sound of Change Live concert in London, as part of\nChime for Change, an organization which supports total equality between women\nand men in all areas of life. Mark Sutherland of Rolling Stone magazine noted\nthat Knowles belted out the song, while Alice Vincent from The Daily Telegraph\nnoted that the rendition of the song reflected the event's purpose. Later, on\nJuly 20, 2013, Knowles performed the song during a stop in Detroit as part of\nher Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. The performance followed the city's recent\nfile for bankruptcy. As Knowles performed, the screen behind her displayed\nphotos of Detroit's landmarks and icons including Aretha Franklin, Aaliyah,\nEminem, Anita Baker, Bob Seger, Kid Rock, the White Stripes, Berry Gordy, Jr,\nJoe Louis. The montage ended with the declaration \"Nothing Stops Detroit!\" and\nKnowles closed the performance by saying \"I love you, Detroit\". A spokesperson\nfor the singer described the performance as a \"unique tribute to the history\nof an incredible city and a celebration of the strong spirit of its people\". A\nblack-and-white video of the cover was uploaded on Knowles' official YouTube\nchannel on July 30, 2013. It closes with a quote from Henry Ford: “Failure is\nsimply the opportunity to start over, this time more intelligently.\" A\nreporter for The Huffington Post reported that the singer's \"heartfelt\" cover\nof the song \"touched\" her fans and the people who loved Detroit. Latifah\nMuhammad of the Black Entertainment Television wrote that Knowles' \"powerful\"\nrendition of the song came right on time. An editor for Essence described\nKnowles' cover as a \"moving tribute to Detroit\". Jordan Sargent of Spin wrote,\n\"It all might come off as a bit heavy-handed if it wasn't for the fact that,\nwell, Beyonce absolutely slays the cover.\" Lauren Moraski from CBS News\ndescribed the tribute to the city as \"touching\". In 2017, Greta Van Fleet\nreleased a cover of the song on their double EP From the Fires. In 2019,\nCéline Dion performed the song as a part of a tribute to Aretha Franklin\ncalled \"Aretha! A Grammy Celebration For The Queen of Soul\". The tribute was\nbroadcast by CBS in March 2019. \"A Change is Gonna Come\" was featured in the\nSpike Lee-directed movie, Malcolm X, for the scene near the end in which\nMalcolm X (played by Denzel Washington) walks into the ballroom where he is\nabout to be assassinated.\n\n## Chart history (Sam Cooke version)\n\n## See also\n\n    * Civil rights movement in popular culture\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n    * Portrait of a Legend 1951-1964.

Plutarch wrote of the sky being on fire near Naples and Silius Italicus mentioned in his epic poem Punica that Vesuvius had thundered and produced flames worthy of Mount Etna in that year, although bo\nDoc 5(Title: # Plinian eruption) \nPlinian eruptions or Vesuvian eruptions are volcanic eruptions marked by their\nsimilarity to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which destroyed the\nancient Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The eruption was described in\na letter written by Pliny the Younger, after the death of his uncle Pliny the\nElder. Plinian/Vesuvian eruptions are marked by columns of volcanic debris and\nhot gases ejected high into the stratosphere, the second layer of Earth's\natmosphere. The key characteristics are ejection of large amount of pumice and\nvery powerful continuous gas-driven eruptions. According to the Volcanic\nExplosivity Index, Plinian eruptions have a VEI of 4, 5 or 6, sub-Plinian 3 or\n4, and ultra-Plinian 6, 7 or 8. Short eruptions can end in less than a day,\nbut longer events can continue for several days or months. The longer\neruptions begin with production of clouds of volcanic ash, sometimes with\npyroclastic surges. The amount of magma erupted can be so large that it\ndepletes the magma chamber below, causing the top of the volcano to collapse,\nresulting in a caldera. Fine ash and pulverized pumice can deposit over large\nareas. Plinian eruptions are often accompanied by loud noises, such as those\ngenerated by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. The sudden discharge of electrical\ncharges accumulated in the air around the ascending column of volcanic ashes\nalso often causes lightning strikes as depicted by the English geologist\nGeorge Julius Poulett Scrope in his painting of 1822. The lava is usually\ndacitic or rhyolitic, rich in silica. Basaltic, low-silica lavas are unusual\nfor Plinian eruptions; is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera on New Zealand's\nNorth Island.\n\n## Pliny's description\n\nPliny described his uncle's involvement from the first observation of the\neruption: Pliny the Elder set out to rescue the victims from their perilous\nposition on the shore of the Bay of Naples, and launched his galleys, crossing\nthe bay to Stabiae (near the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia). Pliny\nthe Younger provided an account of his death, and suggested that he collapsed\nand died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted from the volcano. His body\nwas found interred under the ashes of the eruption with no apparent injuries\non 26 August, after the plume had dispersed, confirming asphyxiation or\npoisoning.\n\n## Examples\n\n  * The Long Valley Caldera eruption in Eastern California, United States, which happened over 760,000 years ago.\n  * The 4860 BC eruption forming Crater Lake in Oregon, United States.\n  * The 1645 BC eruption of Thera in the south Aegean Sea, Greece.\n  * The 400s BC eruption of the Bridge River Vent in British Columbia, Canada.\n  * The 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Pompeii, Italy. It was the prototypical Plinian eruption.\n  * The 180 AD Lake Taupo eruption in New Zealand.\n  * The 946 eruption of Paektu Mountain in China/North Korea\n  * The 1257 eruption of Mount Samalas in Lombok, Indonesia\n  * The 1600 eruption of Huaynaputina in Peru.\n  * The 1667 and 1739 eruptions of Mount Tarumae in Hokkaido, Japan.\n  * The 1707 eruption of Mount Fuji in Japan.\n  * The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the island of Sumbawa, Indonesia.\n  * The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in Sunda Strait, Indonesia.\n  * The 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera in New Zealand.\n  * The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in the United States.\n  * The 1982 eruption of El Chichón in Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc, Chiapas, Mexico.\n  * The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in Zambales, Central Luzon, Philippines.\n  * The June 2009 eruption of Sarychev Peak in Russia.\n\n## Ultra-Plinian\n\nAccording to the Volcanic Explosivity Index, a VEI of 6 to 8 is classified as\n\"ultra-Plinian\". Eruptions of this type are defined by ash plumes over high\nand a volume of erupted material to in size.

The series was\nwritten by Jason Aaron and drawn by Steve Dillon. Unlike the concurrently\nrunning Marvel Universe-proper series featuring the Punisher, the MAX imprint\nallows the creators the freedom to write more realistic and hard-edged stories\nthat cannot be seen in regular mainline Marvel Universe stories. Also unlike\nthe previous MAX series, which focused mainly on Frank Castle/The Punisher's\nwar against the mob, this series has him squaring off against MAX versions of\npopular Marvel super villains' such as Wilson Fisk/Kingpin, Bullseye and\nElektra. The series came to a conclusion with issue #22.\n\n## Story arcs\n\n### \"Kingpin\" (#1-5)\n\nInterrogating a mobster, the Punisher discovers a meeting place where many of\nthem will be in the same place. After the meeting with the mob bosses, the men\ndetermine that the mythic \"Kingpin of Crime\" should be fabricated by them in\norder to throw the Punisher off their trails. One of the bosses' bodyguards,\nWilson Fisk, is apparently chosen as this new figurehead. When the Punisher\ncrashes the meeting, Fisk gets the bosses to safety and has a chance to kill\nthe Punisher, which he does not take. He goes home to his wife and sleeping\nchild, when he receives the call that will seat him as the Kingpin. Smiling,\nhinting at an ulterior motive, he accepts.\n\n### \"Bullseye\" (#6-11)\n\nImmediately after Wilson Fisk becomes the \"Kingpin of Crime,\" he cancels all\nof the former bosses' appointments. However, Fisk's secretary calls and\ninforms him that one man refuses to have his appointment canceled. The man is\nknown only as Bullseye, the world's deadliest assassin. Bullseye never misses\nhis target, and has set his sights on the Punisher.\n\n### \"Frank\" (#12-16)\n\nAfter the cruel fight against Bullseye, Frank gets arrested and sent to a\nhigh-security prison with a thousand people who want nothing more than to see\nhim dead. Frank reflects back on his time during the war and immediately after\nreturning home, while struggling to understand his Punisher persona and\nrefusing offers from crime bosses. He contemplates a life of peace versus\ncontinuing his violent methods.\n\n### \"Homeless\" (#17-21)\n\nFrank escapes prison and goes into his final confrontation with Wilson Fisk\naka The Kingpin, and his new bodyguard, Elektra.\n\n### \"War's End\" (#22)\n\nThe series concludes with issue #22, which covers the death, funeral, and\nburial of Frank Castle. At the end of issue #22 the Punisher's death sparks a\npublic uprising, with citizens purging New York's criminals.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe series holds an average rating of 8.6 by 85 professional critics on the\nreview aggregation website Comic Book Roundup.\n\n## Prints\n\n### Issues\n\n### Specials\n\n### Collected editions\n\n## References\n\n## External links\nDoc 5(Title: lects G.I.

    "question": "Why was the hughes family back on family feud?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, contestants on Family Feud can return to the show due to the \"returning champions\" rule. This rule allows families to appear for a limited number of days, typically five, before they are considered champions and are no longer eligible to return. The Hughes family likely returned to the show because they were still within the allowed number of appearances, and they were able to perform well enough to be invited back for another round.",

The show has\nhad three separate runs; the original run from 1976–85 aired on ABC during the\ndaytime, and had a separate nighttime edition that ran in syndication and was\nhosted by Richard Dawson. In 1988, the series was revived and aired on CBS and\nalso had a nighttime syndication edition.

A third\nrun began in 1999 in syndication only, and continues to run through 2019,\nbeing hosted by a series of different hosts, including Louie Anderson\n(1999–2002), Richard Karn (2002–2006), John O'Hurley (2006–2010), and Steve\nHarvey (2010–present).

If the two contestants\nreach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If\nnot, they are given $5 per point scored as a consolation prize. The grand\nprize for winning Fast Money has varied. When the program aired in daytime,\nfamilies played for $5,000. The grand prize for syndicated episodes was\n$10,000 for much of its existence. In 2001, the prize was doubled to $20,000\nat the request of then-host Louie Anderson, where it has remained since.\n\n### Returning champions\n\nWhen Family Feud premiered on ABC, network rules dictated how much a family\ncould win. Once any family reached $25,000, they were retired as champions.\nThe accompanying syndicated series that premiered in 1977 featured two new\nfamilies each episode because of tape bicycling (a practice then common in\nsyndicated television). The CBS daytime and syndicated versions which began\nairing in 1988 also featured returning champions, who could appear for a\nmaximum of five days. For a brief period in the 1994–95 season which aired in\nsyndication, there were no returning champions. For these episodes, two new\nfamilies competed in this first half of each episode. The second half featured\nformer champion families who appeared on Family Feud between 1977 and 1985,\nwith the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in\nthe second half. From 1999 to 2002, two new families appeared on each episode.\nThe returning champions rule was reinstated with the same five-day limit\nstarting with the 2002–03 season. Starting with the 2009–10 season, a family\nthat wins five matches also wins a new car (currently a Toyota C-HR).\n\n### Bullseye game\n\nIn June 1992, the CBS daytime edition of Feud expanded from 30 to 60 minutes\nand became known as the Family Feud Challenge. As part of the change, a new\nround was added at the start of each game called \"Bullseye\". This round\ndetermined the potential Fast Money stake for each team. Each team was given a\nstarting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to\na survey question to add to it. The Bullseye round was added to the syndicated\nedition in September 1992, which remained 30 minutes and was retitled as the\nNew Family Feud. The first two members of each family appeared at the face-off\npodium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was\navailable. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the\nfamily's bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from\neach family. On the first half of the daytime version, families were staked\nwith $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question\nworth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This\nallowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the\ndaytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled,\nmaking the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the\ngame played for their bank in Fast Money. When Richard Dawson returned as host\nof the program in 1994, the round's name was changed to the \"Bankroll\" round.\nAlthough the goal remained of giving only the number-one answer, the format\nwas modified to three questions from five, with only one member of each family\nparticipating for all three questions. The initial stake for each family\nremained the same ($2,500 in the first half of the hour and $5,000 in the\nsecond). However, the value for each question was $500, $1,500 and $2,500 in\nthe first half, with values doubling for the second half. This meant a\npotential maximum bank of $7,000 in the first half and $14,000 in the second.\nThe Bullseye round temporarily returned during the 2009–10 season. It was\nplayed similarly as the format used from 1992 to 1994 on the syndicated\nversion, with five questions worth from $1,000 to $5,000. However, each family\nwas given a $15,000 starting stake, which meant a potential maximu\nDoc 4(Title:  the first,) a buzzer sounds and he/she must give another answer. If the two contestants\nreach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If\nnot, they are given $5 per point scored as a consolation prize. The grand\nprize for winning Fast Money has varied. When the program aired in daytime,\nfamilies played for $5,000. The grand prize for syndicated episodes was\n$10,000 for much of its existence. In 2001, the prize was doubled to $20,000\nat the request of then-host Louie Anderson, where it has remained since.\n\n### Returning champions\n\nWhen Family Feud premiered on ABC, network rules dictated how much a family\ncould win. Once any family reached $25,000, they were retired as champions.\nThe accompanying syndicated series that premiered in 1977 featured two new\nfamilies each episode because of tape bicycling (a practice then common in\nsyndicated television). The CBS daytime and syndicated versions which began\nairing in 1988 also featured returning champions, who could appear for a\nmaximum of five days. For a brief period in the 1994–95 season which aired in\nsyndication, there were no returning champions. For these episodes, two new\nfamilies competed in this first half of each episode. The second half featured\nformer champion families who appeared on Family Feud between 1977 and 1985,\nwith the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in\nthe second half. From 1999 to 2002, two new families appeared on each episode.\nThe returning champions rule was reinstated with the same five-day limit\nstarting with the 2002–03 season. Starting with the 2009–10 season, a family\nthat wins five matches also wins a new car (currently a Toyota C-HR).\n\n### Bullseye game\n\nIn June 1992, the CBS daytime edition of Feud expanded from 30 to 60 minutes\nand became known as the Family Feud Challenge. As part of the change, a new\nround was added at the start of each game called \"Bullseye\". This round\ndetermined the potential Fast Money stake for each team. Each team was given a\nstarting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to\na survey question to add to it. The Bullseye round was added to the syndicated\nedition in September 1992, which remained 30 minutes and was retitled as the\nNew Family Feud. The first two members of each family appeared at the face-off\npodium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was\navailable. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the\nfamily's bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from\neach family. On the first half of the daytime version, families were staked\nwith $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question\nworth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This\nallowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the\ndaytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled,\nmaking the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the\ngame played for their bank in Fast Money. When Richard Dawson returned as host\nof the program in 1994, the round's name was changed to the \"Bankroll\" round.\nAlthough the goal remained of giving only the number-one answer, the format\nwas modified to three questions from five, with only one member of each family\nparticipating for all three questions. The initial stake for each family\nremained the same ($2,500 in the first half of the hour and $5,000 in the\nsecond). However, the value for each question was $500, $1,500 and $2,500 in\nthe first half, with values doubling for the second half.

This rule allows families to appear for a limited number of days, typically five, before they are considered champions and are no longer eligible to return. The Hughes family likely returned to the show because they were still within the allowed number of appearances, and they were able to perform well enough to be invited back for another round."

Locations for the production included Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the\nWilliamsburg Bridge, Columbus Circle and Central Park West, Cortlandt Alley,\nCircle Line Downtown cruises, the Manhattan Family Court building, Long Island\nCity, Grand Ferry Park in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Sunnyside, Queens,\nPulaski Bridge, the Roosevelt Island and its steam plant, the Bronx County\nCourthouse, Newtown Creek, The Roosevelt Hotel, Astoria Park, Tudor City,\nHunts Point, Bronx, the Forest Park Carousel, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, the\n\"GoodFellas Diner\" before it was damaged in a 2018 fire and the Mount Zion\nCemetery, both in Maspeth, Queens, and in Astoria, Queens. A car chase for the\nseason was filmed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in night shoots, with Moss-\nBachrach driving one of the cars. Filming for the season wrapped on April 9,\n2017.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nVisual effects supervisor Greg Anderson and vendor FuseFX returned from the\nfirst season of Luke Cage to create the visual effects for The Punisher,\ncreating 855 visual effects shots across the season. Their team changed in\nsize for each episode, but generally consisted of 15 to 20 people. Due to the\nrealistic tone of the series, which does not feature any superpowers, the\nvisual effects department had to work even harder than usual to ensure their\neffects were believable, with a focus on creating \"gunplay, knifeplay,\nexplosions and other real world effects.\" They preferred to augment practical\neffects rather than start from scratch to help with realism as well as the\nseries' budget and schedule. As an example of the work Fuse did during fight\nsequences, Anderson discussed the scene where Russo and his men attack Micro's\nbasement. Though practical prop weapons were used for the fight, Fuse had to\naugment the action with computer generated blood, knives, and muzzle flashes,\nas well as a computer generated head that is blown apart by a shotgun. The\nsequence was thoroughly storyboarded and pre-visualized to plan out the exact\nvisuals required. Because the scene, like many others throughout the season,\nrequired a dark environment the visual effects team had to work with the\ncinematography department to decide where the low-light should be practical\nand where color-grading could be used to alter a more brightly-lit set given\nit is difficult to integrate visual effects with dark images. Conversely to\nthis scene, a sequence such as when Russo blows up a hideout required minimal\nvisual effects work because the explosion was shot practically, with Fuse\nmainly just adding some windows to the building that were removed for the\nexplosion. The most technically difficult scene of the season to create was in\nthe first episode, where Castle shoots someone from across the Mexico–United\nStates border. Anderson estimated that the scene was 90 percent digital, with\nthe environment between Castle and his target created entirely by the visual\neffects department. So that Moore could portray amputee Curtis Hoyle, Fuse had\nto digitally replace his leg in several shots. This involved Moore wearing a\ngreen sleeve over his leg and Fuse replacing it with a stump. The company also\nhad to recreate the background behind Moore's actual leg which was often the\nmost difficult part, such as when he is getting out of bed and realistic-\nlooking digital cloth needed to match with the actual sheets that were on set.\nAdditionally, visual effects were used to augment cement in the sequence where\npeople are thrown into it. The special effects department created a mixture to\nlook like cement for use while filming the scene, but it ultimately did not\nlook realistic on camera and had to be changed digitally.\n\n### Music\n\nIn April 2017, Tyler Bates was announced as the composer\n</information>\n\n\nThe film \"A League of Their Own\" was primarily filmed in various locations around Chicago, Illinois, including Wrigley Field, which served as the main baseball stadium for the movie.

    "question": "Which protocol provides names and name resolution for workgroups in windows?",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, the protocol that provides names and name resolution for workgroups in Windows is **NetBIOS**. Specifically, the name service provided by NetBIOS is crucial for registering and resolving NetBIOS names within a workgroup. This service operates on UDP port 137 (TCP port 137 can also be used, but rarely is) and allows applications to register and look up NetBIOS names on the network. This is fundamental for establishing connections and sharing resources within a local workgroup in Windows environments.\n<answer> The protocol that provides names and name resolution for workgroups in Windows is NetBIOS. NetBIOS offers a name service that registers and resolves NetBIOS names within a workgroup, allowing applications to communicate and share resources effectively. This service operates on UDP port 137 (with TCP port 137 as an alternative, though less common). </answer>",

Consequently, even today, Microsoft) file and printer sharing over Ethernet continues to be called NetBEUI, with\nthe name NetBIOS commonly used only in reference to file and printer sharing\nover TCP/IP. In truth, the former is the NetBIOS Frames protocol (NBF), and\nthe latter is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT). Since its original publishing in a\ntechnical reference book from IBM, the NetBIOS API specification has become a\nde facto standard.\n\n## Services\n\nNetBIOS provides three distinct services:\n\n  * Name service (NetBIOS-NS) for name registration and resolution.\n  * Datagram distribution service (NetBIOS-DGM) for connectionless communication.\n  * Session service (NetBIOS-SSN) for connection-oriented communication.\n\n### Name service\n\nIn order to start sessions or distribute datagrams, an application must\nregister its NetBIOS name using the name service. NetBIOS names are 16 octets\nin length and vary based on the particular implementation. Frequently, the\n16th octet, called the NetBIOS Suffix, designates the type of resource, and\ncan be used to tell other applications what type of services the system\noffers. In NBT, the name service operates on UDP port 137 (TCP port 137 can\nalso be used, but rarely is). The name service primitives offered by NetBIOS\nare:\n\n  * Add name – registers a NetBIOS name.\n  * Add group name – registers a NetBIOS \"group\" name.\n  * Delete name – un-registers a NetBIOS name or group name.\n  * Find name – looks up a NetBIOS name on the network.\n\nNetBIOS name resolution is not supported by Microsoft for Internet Protocol\nVersion 6 (IPv6).\n\n### Datagram distribution service\n\nDatagram mode is connectionless; the application is responsible for error\ndetection and recovery. In NBT, the datagram service runs on UDP port 138. The\ndatagram service primitives offered by NetBIOS are:\n\n  * Send Datagram – send a datagram to a remote NetBIOS name.\n  * Send Broadcast Datagram – send a datagram to all NetBIOS names on the network.\n  * Receive Datagram – wait for a packet to arrive from a Send Datagram operation.\n  * Receive Broadcast Datagram – wait for a packet to arrive from a Send Broadcast Datagram operation.\n\n### Session service\n\nSession mode lets two computers establish a connection, allows messages to\nspan multiple packets, and provides error detection and recovery. In NBT, the\nsession service runs on TCP port 139. The session service primitives offered\nby NetBIOS are:\n\n  * Call – opens a session to a remote NetBIOS name.\n  * Listen – listen for attempts to open a session to a NetBIOS name.\n  * Hang Up – close a session.\n  * Send – sends a packet to the computer on the other end of a session.\n  * Send No Ack – like Send, but doesn't require an acknowledgment.\n  * Receive – wait for a packet to arrive from a Send on the other end of a session.\n\nIn the original protocol used to implement NetworkBIOS services on PC-Network,\nto establish a session, the initiating computer sends an Open request which is\nanswered by an Open acknowledgment. The computer that started the session will\nthen send a Session Request packet which will prompt either a Session Accept\nor Session Reject packet. During an established session, each transmitted\npacket is answered by either a positive-acknowledgment (ACK) or negative-\nacknowledgment (NAK) response. A NAK will prompt retransmission of the data.\nSessions are closed by the non-initiating computer by sending a close request.\nThe computer that started the session will reply with a close response which\nprompts the final session closed packet.\n\n## NetBIOS name vs Internet host name\n\nWhen NetBIOS is run in conjunction with Internet protocols (e.g., NBT), each\ncomputer may have multiple names: one or more NetBIOS name service names and\none or more Internet host names.\n\n### NetBIOS name\n\nThis suffix describes the service or name record type such as host record,\nmaster browser record, or domain controller record or other services.

Version 3.0 includes four new\nmajor components:\n\n  * Windows Presentation Foundation is a user interface subsystem and framework based vector graphics, which makes use of 3D computer graphics hardware and Direct3D technologies. It provides the foundation for building applications and blending together application UI, documents, and media content. It is the successor to Windows Forms.\n  * Windows Communication Foundation is a service-oriented messaging subsystem that enables applications and systems to interoperate locally or remotely using Web services.\n  * Windows Workflow Foundation provides task automation and integrated transactions using workflows. It is the programming model, engine and tools for building workflow-enabled applications on Windows.\n  * Windows CardSpace is a component that securely stores digital identities of a person, and provides a unified interface for choosing the identity for a particular transaction, such as logging into a website.\n\nThese technologies are also available for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003\nto facilitate their introduction to and usage by developers and end users.\nThere are also significant new development APIs in the core of the operating\nsystem, notably the completely re-designed audio, networking, print, and video\ninterfaces, major changes to the security infrastructure, improvements to the\ndeployment and installation of applications (\"ClickOnce\" and Windows Installer\n4.0), new device driver development model (\"Windows Driver Foundation\"),\nTransactional NTFS, mobile computing API advancements (power management,\nTablet PC Ink support, SideShow) and major updates to (or complete\nreplacements of) many core subsystems such as Winlogon and CAPI.

Also, games that require the\nfeatures of D3D9Ex, the updated implementation of DirectX 9 in Windows Vista\nare also incompatible with previous Windows versions. According to a Microsoft\nblog, there are three choices for OpenGL implementation on Vista. An\napplication can use the default implementation, which translates OpenGL calls\ninto the Direct3D API and is frozen at OpenGL version 1.4, or an application\ncan use an Installable Client Driver (ICD), which comes in two flavors: legacy\nand Vista-compatible.

    "question": "How many exemptions are there to the freedom of information act?",
    "agent_answer": "<answer>There are nine exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as detailed in Title 5 of the United States Code, section 552. These exemptions cover various types of sensitive information, including those specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order for national defense or foreign policy interests, trade secrets, and information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Additionally, there are numerous statutes that qualify as Exemption 3 statutes, which are not explicitly listed within the FOIA itself but rather require specific citations in the relevant statutes. The number of these Exemption 3 statutes is not fixed and can vary based on judicial interpretation and new legislation. As of recent years, academic analysis suggests there are approximately 156 distinct provisions of law that qualify as Exemption 3 statutes, although this number can change over time.</answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\nTo determine how many exemptions exist under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I need to gather information on the specific exemptions provided by the legislation.\n\n<search>Freedom of Information Act exemptions</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: # FOIA Exemption 3 Statutes) \nStatutes Found to Qualify under Exemption 3 of the U.S. Freedom of Information\nAct, 5 U.S.C.§ 552(b)(3). Under its terms, as amended in 1976 and 2009, a\nstatute qualifies as an \"Exemption 3 statute\" only if it \"(i) requires that\nthe matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no\ndiscretion on the issue; or (ii) establishes particular criteria for\nwithholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\"\nAdditionally, any statute enacted after October 29, 2009 acting to exclude\ninformation release must contain a specific citation to subsection (b)(3) of\nthe FOIA statute.\n\n## Limitations of the list\n\nThe U.S. Freedom of Information Act's exemptions from release of information\ncan be found at 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1)-(9)[]. Exemption 3 of FOIA is cited as 5\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(3). In FOIA responses it is usually cited as just \"(b)(3).\" If\na statute other than the FOIA specifically forbids the release of particular\ninformation or sets clear criteria for types of information not to be\nreleased, it is a (b)(3) statute. Surprisingly, there is no single\nauthoritative list of such statutes. The U.S. Department of Justice, Office of\nInformation Policy[, creates a list of statutes that have been cited in the\nrecent FOIA annual reports by agencies in the federal executive branch. This\nlist is updated annually, but it consists only of statutes tested in court,\ne.g. FY2009 list, FY2013, or FY 2014. In addition, the list cites some\nstatutes as to which there are conflicting opinions as to whether they are\nExemption 3 statutes. In other words, the DOJ list includes statutes that been\njudged as a (b)(3) statute in some federal courts, but not others. These\nconflicting statutes are marked with asterisks. Not included in the DOJ's list\nare statutes that were not cited recently or have not been court tested. The\nDepartment of Justice list can be found in its FOIA Post. A separate list is\nmaintained by the Collaboration on Government Secrecy at American University\nWashington College of Law, and it suggests that the universe of Exemption 3\nstatutes is much greater. . The Collaboration on Government Secrecy has\ndetermined that while agencies report using more than 300 separate statutes\nunder Exemption 3 statute, careful academic analysis reveals that less than\n160 distinct provisions of law truly qualify as Exemption 3, regardless of\nagency or court decisions. This list is updated periodically throughout the\nyear, and it currently cites 156 statutes as correctly \"vetted\" ones . The\nCollaboration on Government Secrecy also maintains a list of leading Exemption\n3 decisions, articles, and news.\n\n## 2009 FOIA Amendment changes to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Information Policy frequently posts\nitems concerning the FOIA called through FOIA Post. On March 10, 2010 it\nposted a summary of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, which was passed as Section 564\nof the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010. The OPEN FOIA\nAct provides that new independent confidentiality provisions passed by\nCongress after the date of its enactment (October 29, 2009) must specifically\nstate in the legislation that they are Exemption 3 statutes for FOIA purposes.\nThe subsection now reads: \"(b)(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by\nstatute(other than section 552(b) of this title), if that statute--(A)(i)\nrequires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to\nleave no discretion on the issue; or (ii) establishes particular criteria for\nwithholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and (B)\nif enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 (i.e.,\nOct. 29, 2009), specifically cites to this paragraph.\"\n\n## Non-Exemption 3 Statutes\n\nSome federal agencies have incorrectly applied statutory provisions that are\nmistakenly believed to qualify as Exemption 3 statutes. The Collaboration on\nGovernment Secrecy at American Universit\nDoc 2(Title: # Freedom of Information Act (United States)) \nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), , is a federal freedom of information\nlaw that requires the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased\ninformation and documents controlled by the United States government upon\nrequest.

While the public may be aware of news\norganizations' use of FOIA for reporting purposes, they make up less than 10%\nof all requests with businesses, law firms, and individuals all being more\nfrequent users.

    "question": "When did the united states start regulating immigration?",
    "agent_answer": "<answer> The United States began regulating immigration through formal legislation in the late 19th century. The first significant federal law to regulate immigration was the Immigration Act of 1882, which imposed taxes on immigrants and excluded convicts, idiots, lunatics, and persons likely to become public charges. Prior to this, immigration had been regulated at the state level and by individual port authorities.\n\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was another early piece of immigration legislation, specifically targeting Chinese laborers entering the country. This act marked one of the earliest forms of racial discrimination in U.S. immigration policy.\n\nAs immigration increased and concerns about national security and economic competition grew, more comprehensive regulations were introduced. The Immigration Act of 1917 established physical and mental exams for immigrants, along with literacy tests for those over 16 years old. The Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 further restricted immigration, implementing quotas based on national origins.\n\nThese early regulatory efforts laid the groundwork for the modern immigration system, which continues to evolve in response to changing social, economic, and political conditions.</answer>",

In the\nSouthern Hemisphere, tea is grown as far south as Hobart on the Australian\nisland of Tasmania and Waikato in New Zealand. Tea plants are propagated from\nseed and cuttings; about 4 to 12 years are needed for a plant to bear seed and\nabout three years before a new plant is ready for harvesting. In addition to a\nzone 8 climate or warmer, tea plants require at least 127 cm (50 in) of\nrainfall a year and prefer acidic soils. Many high-quality tea plants are\ncultivated at elevations of up to above sea level. Though at these heights the\nplants grow more slowly, they acquire a better flavour. Two principal\nvarieties are used: Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, which is used for most\nChinese, Formosan and Japanese teas, and C. sinensis var. assamica, used in\nPu-erh and most Indian teas (but not Darjeeling). Within these botanical\nvarieties, many strains and modern clonal varieties are known. Leaf size is\nthe chief criterion for the classification of tea plants, with three primary\nclassifications being, Assam type, characterised by the largest leaves; China\ntype, characterised by the smallest leaves; and Cambodian type, characterised\nby leaves of intermediate size. The Cambod type tea (C. assamica subsp.\nlasiocaly) was originally considered a type of assam tea. However, later\ngenetic work showed that it is a hybrid between Chinese small leaf tea and\nassam type tea. Darjeeling tea also appears to be hybrids between Chinese\nsmall leaf tea and assam type tea. A tea plant will grow into a tree of up to\nif left undisturbed, but cultivated plants are generally pruned to waist\nheight for ease of plucking. Also, the short plants bear more new shoots which\nprovide new and tender leaves and increase the quality of the tea. Only the\ntop of the mature plant are picked. These buds and leaves are called\n'flushes'. A plant will grow a new flush every seven to 15 days during the\ngrowing season. Leaves that are slow in development tend to produce better-\nflavoured teas. Several teas are available from specified flushes; for\nexample, Darjeeling tea is available as first flush (at a premium price),\nsecond flush, monsoon and autumn. Assam second flush or \"tippy\" tea is\nconsidered superior to first flush, due to the gold tips that appear on the\nleaves. Pests of tea include mosquito bugs of the genus Helopeltis (which are\ntrue bugs that must not be confused with the dipteran) that can tatter leaves,\nso they may be sprayed with insecticides. In addition, there may be\nLepidopteran leaf feeders and various tea diseases.\n\n## Chemical composition\n\nPhysically speaking, tea has properties of both a solution and a suspension.\nIt is a solution of all the water-soluble compounds that have been extracted\nfrom the tea leaves, such as the polyphenols and amino acids, but is a\nsuspension when all of the insoluble components are considered, such as the\ncellulose in the tea leaves. Caffeine constitutes about 3% of tea's dry\nweight, translating to between and per 8-oz (250-ml) cup depending on the\ntype, brand, and brewing method. A study found that the caffeine content of of\nblack tea ranged from , while the caffeine content of of green tea ranged from\n, reflecting a significant difference. Tea also contains small amounts of\ntheobromine and theophylline, which are stimulants, and xanthines similar to\ncaffeine. Black and green teas contain no essential nutrients in significant\namounts, with the exception of the dietary mineral manganese, at per cup or\n26% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI). Fluoride is sometimes present in tea;\ncertain types of \"brick tea\", made from old leaves and stems, have the highest\nlevels, enough to pose a health risk if much tea is drunk, which has been\nattributed to high levels of fluoride in soils, acidic soils, and long\nbrewing.

Tropical moist\nforests are found along the Arabian Sea coast and the Western Ghats. The\nMalabar Coast moist forests are found on the coastal plains. The South Western\nGhats moist deciduous forests are found at intermediate elevations. The\nsouthern Western Ghats have high altitude rain forests called the South\nWestern Ghats montane rain forests. The Western Ghats are a biodiversity\nhotspot. Scrub lands, including the Deccan thorn scrub forests, are common in\nthe interior Deccan plateau. Some of India's famous protected areas are found\nin South India. These include Project Tiger reserves Periyar National Park,\nKalakad - Mundanthurai and Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve.

The Bengali folk epic Manasamangal mentions\nNetidhopani and has some passages set in the Sundarbans during the heroine\nBehula's quest to bring her husband Lakhindar back to life. The area provides\nthe setting for several novels by Emilio Salgari, (e.g. The Mystery of the\nBlack Jungle). Sundarbaney Arjan Sardar, a novel by Shibshankar Mitra, and\nPadma Nadir Majhi, a novel by Manik Bandopadhyay, are based on the rigors of\nlives of villagers and fishermen living in the Sunderbans region, and are\nwoven into the Bengali psyche to a great extent. Part of the plot of Salman\nRushdie's Booker Prize winning novel, Midnight's Children is set in the\nSundarbans. This forest is adopted as the setting of Kunal Basu's short story\n\"The Japanese Wife\" and the subsequent film adaptation. Most of the plot of an\ninternationally acclaimed novelist, Amitav Ghosh's 2004 novel, The Hungry\nTide, is set in the Sundarbans. The plot centres on a headstrong American\ncetologist who arrives to study a rare species of river dolphin, enlisting a\nlocal fisherman and translator to aid her. The book also mentions two accounts\nof the Bonbibi story of \"Dukhey's Redemption\". Manik Bandopadhyay's Padma\nNadir Majhi was made into a movie by Goutam Ghose. The Sunderbans has been the\nsubject of a detailed and well-researched scholarly work on Bonbibi (a 'forest\ngoddess' venerated by Hindus), on the relation between the islanders and\ntigers and on conservation and how it is perceived by the inhabitants of the\nSundarbans, as well as numerous non-fiction books, including The Man-Eating\nTigers of Sundarbans by Sy Montegomery for a young audience, which was\nshortlisted for the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award. In Up The\nCountry, Emily Eden discusses her travels through the Sunderbans. Numerous\ndocumentary movies have been made about the Sunderbans, including the 2003\nIMAX production Shining Bright about the Bengal tiger. The acclaimed BBC TV\nseries Ganges documents the lives of villagers, especially honey collectors,\nin the Sundarbans.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Sundarbans Tiger Project\n  * Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education\n  * Sangu Wildlife Sanctuary\n  * Environmental impact of development in the Sundarbans\n\n## Footnotes and references\n\n## Sources\n\n  * Laskar Muqsudur Rahman, The Sundarbans: A Unique Wilderness of the Wo\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, teak is primarily found in the forests of Kerala, particularly in the Nilambur area, where the world's first teak plantation was established in the 1840s by the British.

Tourist areas\nsuch as Sosua and Punta Cana feature many venues with Halloween celebrations,\npredominantly geared towards adults.\n\n### Mexico (Día de Muertos)\n\nObserved in Mexico and Mexican communities abroad, Day of the Dead (Spanish:\nDía de Muertos) celebrations arose from the syncretism of indigenous Aztec\ntraditions with the Christian Hallowtide of the Spanish colonizers. Flower\ndecorations, altars and candies are part of this holiday season. The holiday\nis distinct from Halloween in its origins and observances, but the two have\nbecome associated because of cross-border connections between Mexico and the\nUnited States through popular culture and migration, as the two celebrations\noccur at the same time of year and may involve similar imagery, such as\nskeletons. Halloween and Día de Muertos have influenced each other in some\nareas of the United States and Mexico, with Halloween traditions such as\ncostumes and face-painting becoming increasingly common features of the\nMexican festival.\n\n## Asia\n\n### China\n\nThe Chinese celebrate the \"Hungry Ghost Festival\" in mid-July, when it is\ncustomary to float river lanterns to remember those who have died. By\ncontrast, Halloween is often called \"All Saints' Festival\" (Wànshèngjié, 萬聖節),\nor (less commonly) \"All Saints' Eve\" (Wànshèngyè, 萬聖夜) or \"Eve of All Saints'\nDay\" (Wànshèngjié Qiányè, 萬聖節前夕), stemming from the term \"All Hallows Eve\"\n(hallow referring to the souls of holy saints). Chinese Christian churches\nhold religious celebrations. Non-religious celebrations are dominated by\nexpatriate Americans or Canadians, but costume parties are also popular for\nChinese young adults, especially in large cities. Hong Kong Disneyland and\nOcean Park (Halloween Bash) host annual Halloween shows. Mainland China has\nbeen less influenced by Anglo traditions than Hong Kong and Halloween is\ngenerally considered \"foreign\". As Halloween has become more popular globally\nit has also become more popular in China, however, particularly amongst\nchildren attending private or international schools with many foreign teachers\nfrom North America.\n\n#### Hong Kong\n\nTraditional \"door-to-door\" trick or treating is not commonly practiced in Hong\nKong due to the vast majority of Hong Kong residents living in high-rise\napartment blocks. However, in many buildings catering to expatriates,\nHalloween parties and limited trick or treating is arranged by the management.\nInstances of street-level trick or treating in Hong Kong occur in ultra-\nexclusive gated housing communities such as The Beverly Hills populated by\nHong Kong's super-rich and in expatriate areas like Discovery Bay and the Red\nHill Peninsula. For the general public, there are events at Tsim Sha Tsui's\nAvenue of the Stars that try to mimic the celebration. In the Lan Kwai Fong\narea of Hong Kong, known as a major entertainment district for the\ninternational community, a Halloween celebration and parade has taken place\nfor over 20 years, with many people dressing in costume and making their way\naround the streets to various drinking establishments. Many international\nschools also celebrate Halloween with costumes, and some put an academic twist\non the celebrations such as the \"Book-o-ween\" celebrations at Hong Kong\nInternational School where students dress as favorite literary characters.\n\n### Japan\n\nHalloween arrived in Japan mainly as a result of American pop culture. As\nrecently as 2009, it was not appreciated and only celebrated by expats. The\nwearing of elaborate costumes by young adults at night is recently very\npopular in areas such as Amerikamura in Osaka and Shibuya in Tokyo, where, in\nOctober 2012, about 1700 people dressed in costumes to take part in the\nHalloween Festival. The holiday has become popular with young adults as a\ncostume party and club event.

In some of these communities, in\nstates such as Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, the celebrations tend to be\nmostly traditional.

We heard him singing some of\nour lines, but we still didn't know what he was going to do. We were worried\nhe might take some of our original song out. But he just sang our words.\" The\nmusical note structure interpolates \"I Hope You Dance\" by country singer Leann\nWomack.\n\n## Lyrics and interpretation\n\nThe lyrics, written by O'Donoghue, focus on perseverance and making a\ndifference. As reported in The Guardian, \"O'Donoghue's real metier is lyrics:\nhe's a striking and emotional storyteller\". Billboard describes the song as \"a\nswelling, piano-driven number with an uplifting, earworm of a chorus that\nsoars, 'Standing in the hall of fame / And the world's gonna know your name /\nCause you burn with the brightest flame.'\" O'Donoghue explains that this song\nwas about the band as he tells \"the title is mostly about us. As any geek fan\nof the band could tell you, we're all extremely different people, but magic\nhappens when you mix us together. Well, magic or a car crash, which is how we\ndescribe the songs we scrap.\" He also said: \"We wanted to inspire people to\nstop trying to be famous for the sake of it.\"\n\n## Music video\n\nThe music video of \"Hall of Fame\" was produced under Sony Music Entertainment\nUK Limited.

In the\n1970s and early 1980s, Hall scored numerous Billboard chart hits and is\nregarded as one of the best soul singers of his generation. Guitarist Robert\nFripp, who collaborated with him in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has\nwritten, \"Daryl's pipes were a wonder. I have never worked with a more able\nsinger.\" Since late 2007, he has hosted the web television series Live from\nDaryl's House, which is now aired on MTV. He was inducted into the Songwriters\nHall of Fame in 2004 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014.\n\n## Early life and career\n\nHall was born in Pottstown, a Pennsylvania borough from Philadelphia. His\nparents each had a background in music: his father was a professional singer\nand his mother was a vocal coach. He started recording while still a student\nat Owen J. Roberts High School, from which he graduated in 1964. In college at\nTemple University in Philadelphia, he majored in music, while continuing to\nrecord, working with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff as both an artist and a\nsession musician. During his first semester at Temple, in the fall of 1965, he\nand four other white Temple University students formed the vocal harmony group\nthe Temptones. They were popular additions to the largely black Philly soul\nscene, defeating both The Ambassadors and The Delfonics in a contest at the\nUptown Theater. The Temptones recorded a handful of singles for Arctic\nRecords, produced by Jimmy Bishop. While performing at the Uptown theater,\nHall formed creative affiliations with such artists as Smokey Robinson, The\nTemptations, and many other top soul singers of the 1960s. In 1967 Hall met\nJohn Oates, who was also an undergraduate at Temple University. According to\nDaryl Hall, they met when \"We got in the middle of a fight at a dance - I have\nno idea what the fight was about. I guess the Greek letters on one gang's\njackets didn't appeal to the other gang. We both beat it out the back and met\non the elevator while leaving the place rather quickly.\" Hall was by then a\nsenior, while Oates was a freshman. They played together until Oates\ntransferred to a different school at age 19. Hall did not let Oates' departure\ndiscourage him from pursuing his own musical career: he dropped out of college\nin 1968 and worked with Tim Moore in a short-lived rock band, Gulliver, and\nreleased an album on the Elektra Records label. In 1969 Hall again began\nrecording songs by other artists, which led to the duo signing their first\nrecord contract in early 1972.\n\n## Hall & Oates\n\nSigned to Atlantic by Ahmet Ertegun and managed by Tommy Mottola in the early\n1970s, Hall & Oates have sold more albums than any other duo in music history.\nTheir second album, Abandoned Luncheonette, produced by Arif Mardin and\nreleased in 1973, yielded the single, \"She's Gone\", which went to No. 7 in the\nU.S. Top 10 on re-release in 1976 after reaching No. 1 on the R&B; charts when\nit was covered by Tavares. The duo recorded one more album with Atlantic, War\nBabies (produced by Todd Rundgren), before they were dropped and promptly\nsigned to RCA. During their tenure at RCA the duo catapulted to international\nsuperstardom. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, Hall & Oates scored six\nU.S. No. 1 singles, including \"Rich Girl\" (also No. 1 R&B;), \"Kiss on My\nList\", \"Private Eyes\", \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\" (also No. 1 R&B;),\n\"Maneater\" and \"Out of Touch\" from their six multi-platinum albums - Bigger\nThan Both of Us, Voices, Private Eyes, H2O, Rock 'n Soul Part 1 and Big Bam\nBoom - the last five of which were released consecutively. The era also\nproduced an additional six U.S. Top 10 singles, \"Sara Smile\", \"One on One\",\n\"Family Man,\" \"You Make My Dreams,\" \"Say It Isn't So\nDoc 5(Title: 100 greatest singers of all time.

By the end of 2002, all of its remaining 29 restaurants had closed.\n\n<answer> Bill Knapps, the restaurant chain, officially went out of business on May 21, 2002, when it filed for voluntary Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Michigan. By the end of that year, all of its remaining 29 restaurants had closed. The chain's decline was attributed to several factors, including a shift in demographic preferences, changes in marketing and menu offerings that alienated loyal customers, and increased food safety regulations that raised costs and compromised the quality of the food, moving away from the original \"from-scratch\" philosophy. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> To answer when Bill Knapps went out of business, I need to search for reliable information on this specific business closure date.</think>\n\n<search>Bill Knapps out of business</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: # Bill Knapp's) \nBill Knapp's was an American family restaurant chain. It was founded by\nClinton B. Knapp (March 13, 1907 – October 15, 1974), in Battle Creek,\nMichigan, in 1948. The chain operated in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Illinois and\nIndiana, with more than 60 locations at its peak.\n\n## The menu\n\nBill Knapp's featured a menu primarily filled with typical family dining\nitems. The menu included a limited breakfast, sandwiches, baskets, and\nluncheon and dinner plates. A children's menu, featuring meals named for\nanimals, was also offered. Recipes for their fried chicken, bean soup, ham\ncroquettes, vegetable soup, onion rings, au gratin potatoes, and chocolate\ncakes (later purchased by Awrey Bakeries) were also featured. Locations\nreplenished inventory on a daily basis from the commissary in Battle Creek,\nMich. with their own fleet of trucks. Bill Knapp placed great emphasis on the\nquality and freshness of the food, with added emphasis on preparing the food\n\"from scratch.\"\n\n## Demographics\n\nBill Knapp \"was interested in providing decent food for a reasonable price\nwith friendly service.\" The target clientele of his restaurants was families,\noften three generations eating together at long tables pushed together. As the\ndecades passed, the clientele remained nearly the same as it had when the\nfirst restaurant of the chain opened in 1948. By the 1980s and 1990s, with the\nbreakdown of extended families, the clientele was predominantly senior\ncitizens. In 1998, after its sale to an entrepreneur from California, Bill\nKnapp's instituted a \"That was then, this is WOW\" marketing campaign, as well\nas an overall revamp of the chain's image. The new ownership hung colorful\nshower curtains between eating booths, played rock and roll music (often\nloudly) throughout the dining areas, revised old building exteriors with\nnewer, hipper color schemes, and further changes, including the installation\nof televisions and video games in restaurants. The \"That was then, this is\nWOW\" campaign not only changed the interior and exterior décor, but the menu\nas well. Prior to 1996, Bill Knapp's cuisine was prepared, home style, in a\ncommissary which supplied all of its restaurants daily or every other day. In\nan effort to cut costs, the commissary model was abandoned in favor of\npurchasing food from food services local to each restaurant, as well as\nsubstituting Lipton soups and Kraft macaroni and cheese for the previously\nhome-made versions provided by the commissary.\n\n## Downfall\n\nThis overhaul of the chain's demographics, however, proved unsuccessful. Loyal\ndiners felt alienated by the changes made; abandonment of Mr. Knapp's \"from-\nscratch\" philosophy drove these loyal customers away for good. Furthermore,\nthe campaign failed to recruit the younger-family crowd, resulting in further\nerosion of the chain's customer base. Another reason for the shift away from\nthe made-from-scratch philosophy was a Listeria outbreak in the early 1990s.\nAs the restaurant struggled to recover from the negative publicity, many new,\nupdated food safety standards were initiated. Some food preparation that was\ntaking place in the restaurants had to be moved back to the commissaries, to\nbe monitored more closely. This was not as cost effective, as more foods\nneeded to be processed and frozen to ensure safety. As commissary costs\ncontinued to rise, more of Bill Knapp's signature foods had to be outsourced\nto larger processing facilities. By 2000, the commissaries were becoming\nlittle more than distribution centers. Fresh, handmade hamburger patties were\nreplaced by frozen, eggs by a powdered substitute, and even the marinated\nchicken breasts were coming in frozen packages. (Raw chicken breasts had been\nmarinated overnight in the restaurants.) While the organization elevated food\nsafety standards, higher costs combined with lower quality led the chain to\nits ultimate downfall. In 2001, Bill Knapp's tried to reverse course by\nannouncing that \"The Tradition is Back,\" restoring the \nDoc 2(Title: n breasts had been) marinated overnight in the restaurants.) While the organization elevated food\nsafety standards, higher costs combined with lower quality led the chain to\nits ultimate downfall. In 2001, Bill Knapp's tried to reverse course by\nannouncing that \"The Tradition is Back,\" restoring the original menu and some\noriginal décor, but by then it was too late. On Tuesday May 21, 2002, Bill\nKnapp’s filed for voluntary Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for\nthe Western District of Michigan. At the time company operated 29 restaurants.\nBy the end of 2002, the chain's last restaurant had closed.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\nDoc 3(Title: our years later of heart failure at a hospital in San Diego,) California, on January 14, 1984, at the age of 81, and was buried at the El\nCamino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego.

The following week, Sam Spoons' \"Bill Posters Will Be\nBand\" played their last, and the week after, \"Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band\" (with\nVernon guesting) also disbanded. Spoons died on September 27, 2018 following a\nlong illness. In 2019 the members of the band became embroiled in a legal\nbattle with \"Anglo Atlantic Media Limited\" which had trademarked their name,\ntwo years previously, without their permission. One of the directors of Anglo\nAtlantic Media Limited is their former promoter Bob Carruthers. The trademark\nhad made it impossible to perform or record under the band name.\n\n## Band members\n\nThe core members of the group for most of the band's career were:\n\n  * Vivian Stanshall (1943–1995): trumpet, lead vocals\n  * Neil Innes (1944–2019): piano, guitar, vocals\n  * Rodney \"Rhino\" Desborough Slater (b. 1944): saxophone\n  * Roger Ruskin Spear (b. 1943): tenor sax and various contraptions\n  * \"Legs\" Larry Smith (b. 1944): drums\n\nThe very first lineup of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band consisted of members of\nthe unnamed jazz band formed, firstly, by members of the St. Martin's College\nJazz Band in September 1959 and then added to by members of the Royal College\nof Art Jazz Band in October 1961. Initial members of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah\nBand:\n\n  * Rodney \"Rhino\" Desborough Slater (b. 1944): clarinet from September 1959 (St. Martin's College Jazz Band)\n  * Tom Parkinson: sousaphone from September 1959 (St. Martin's College Jazz Band)\n  * Chris Jennings: trombone from September 1959 (St. Martin's College Jazz Band)\n  * Roger \"Happy Wally\" Wilkes: trumpet from October 1961 (Royal College of Art Jazz Band)\n  * Trevor Brown: banjo from October 1961 (Royal College of Art Jazz Band)\n\nOnce Vivian Stanshall was added as vocalist in September 1962, two other\nmembers joined the band:\n\n  * Ian Cunningham: saxophone\n  * Danny Hedge: drums\n\nCunningham was replaced by Claude Abbo in early December, and at the end of\n1962, the band split, with only Stanshall, Slater and Wilkes remaining. The\nband's onstage line-up varied, sometimes on a weekly basis, and they also\ninvited a number of guest musicians into the recording studio. Additional\nmembers of various duration include: Vernon Dudley Bohay-Nowell, Martin \"Sam\nSpoons\" Ash, Leon \"lenny\" Williams, John Parry, Raymond Lewitt, Sydney \"Big\nSid\" Nicholls, Bob Kerr, Dave Clague, Joel Druckman, \"Borneo\" Fred Munt,\nChalky Chalkey, Dennis Cowan, Aynsley Dunbar, Jim Capaldi, Anthony 'Bubs'\nWhite, Andy Roberts, Dave Richards, Dick Parry, Hughie Flint, Tony Kaye, and\nGlen Colson. Keith Moon, who became great friends with both Stanshall and\nSmith, played drums for part of The Bonzo's set at the 1969 Plumpton Festival\n(The Who were headlining that night). Stanshall and Innes were the band's\nprincipal songwriters, with occasional contributions from Spear and Smith.\nAfter the band's demise, both Innes and Stanshall became founding members of\nGrimms along with the members of The Scaffold and The Liverpool Scene. Martin\nAsh, alias Sam Spoons, died aged 76 on 27 September 2018. Innes died on 29\nDecember 2019.

The psychedelic rock band Poisoned Electrick\nHead took their name from a phrase coined in the Bonzo's song, \"My Pink Half\nof the Drainpipe\". Also, cult 1990s UK Indie band Sofa Head took their name\nfrom the Bonzo's song of the same name (which itself did not receive an\nofficial release until 1987).\n\n## Television and film\n\nThe Bonzos appeared weekly on the Thames Television show Do Not Adjust Your\nSet.

After two trials, seven of the eleven colonists were found guilty of\nmurder and hanged.\n\n## Description of the massacre\n\nA group of eleven stockmen, consisting of assigned convicts and former\nconvicts, ten of them white Europeans, the 11th, John Johnstone, a black\nAfrican, led by John Henry Fleming, who was from Mungie Bundie Run near Moree,\narrived at Henry Dangar's Myall Creek station in New England on 9 June 1838.\nThey rode up to the station huts beside which were camped a group of\napproximately thirty-five Aboriginal people. They were part of the Wirrayaraay\n(alternative spelling: Weraerai) group who belonged to the Kamilaroi people.\nThey had been camped at the station for a few weeks after being invited by one\nof the convict stockmen, Charles Kilmeister (or Kilminister), to come to their\nstation for their safety and protection from the gangs of marauding stockmen\nwho were roaming the district slaughtering any Aboriginal people they could\nfind. These Aboriginal people had previously been camped peacefully at\nMcIntyre's station for a few months. They were therefore well known to the\nwhites. Most of them had been given European names such as Daddy, King Sandy,\nJoey, Martha and Charley. Some of the children spoke a certain amount of\nEnglish. When the stockmen rode into their camp they fled into the convict's\nhut pleading for protection. When asked by the station hut keeper, George\nAnderson, what they were going to do with the Aboriginal people, John Russell\nsaid they were going to \"take them over the back of the range and frighten\nthem\". The stockmen then entered the hut, tied them to a long tether rope and\nled them away. They took them to a gully on the side of the ridge about 800\nmetres to the west of the station huts. There they slaughtered them all except\nfor one woman whom they kept with them for the next couple of days. The\napproximately 28 people they murdered were largely women, children and old\nmen. Ten younger men were away on a neighbouring station cutting bark. Most of\nthe people were slaughtered with swords as George Anderson, who refused to\njoin the massacre, clearly heard there were just two shots. Unlike Anderson,\nCharles Kilmeister joined the slaughter. Testimony was later given at trial\nthat the children had been beheaded while the men and women were forced to run\nas far as they could between the stockyard fence and a line of sword-wielding\nstockmen who hacked at them as they passed. After the massacre, Fleming and\nhis gang rode off looking to kill the remainder of the group, who they knew\nhad gone to the neighbouring station. They failed to find the other Aboriginal\npeople as they had returned to Myall that night and left after being warned\nthe killers would be returning. On the party's return to Myall two days later,\nthey dismembered and burnt the bodies before resuming the search for the\nremaining people. The ten people had gone to MacIntyre's station near\nInverell, 40 kilometres to the east, where between 30 and 40 Aboriginal people\nwere reportedly murdered with their bodies being cast onto a large fire. Many\nsuspect this massacre was also committed by the same stockmen. After several\ndays of heavy drinking the party dispersed. When the manager of the station,\nWilliam Hobbs, returned several days later and discovered the bodies, counting\nup to twenty-eight of them (as they were beheaded and dismembered he had\ndifficulty determining the exact number) he decided to report the incident but\nKilmeister initially talked him out of it. Hobbs discussed it with a\nneighbouring station overseer, Thomas Foster, who told squatter Frederick Foot\nwho rode to Sydney to report it to the new\nDoc 2(Title: # Waterloo Creek massacre) \nThe Waterloo Creek massacre (also Slaughterhouse Creek massacre) refers to a\nseries of violent clashes between mounted police, civilian vigilantes and\nIndigenous Gamilaraay peoples, which occurred southwest of Moree, New South\nWales, Australia, during December 1837 and January 1838. The events have been\nsubject to much dispute, due to wildly conflicting accounts by various\nparticipants and in subsequent reports and historical analyses, about the\nnature and number of fatalities and the lawfulness of the actions.\nInterpretation of the events at Waterloo Creek was raised again during the\ncontroversial \"history wars\" which began in the 1990s in Australia.\n\n## The events\n\nA Sydney mounted police detachment was dispatched by acting Lieutenant\nGovernor of New South Wales Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass, to track down the\nNamoi, Weraerai and Kamilaroi people who had killed five stockmen in separate\nincidents, on recently established pastoral runs on the upper Gwydir River\narea of New South Wales. After two months the mounted police, consisting of\ntwo sergeants and twenty troopers led by Major James Nunn, arrested 15\nAboriginals along the Namoi River. They released all but two, one of whom was\nshot whilst attempting to escape. The main body of Kamilaroi eluded the\ntroopers, thus Major Nunn's party, along with two stockmen, pursued the\nKamilaroi for three weeks, from present-day Manilla on the Namoi River north\nto the upper Gwydir River. On the morning of 26 January, in a surprise attack\non Nunn's party, Corporal Hannan was wounded in the leg with a spear, and\nsubsequently four or five Aboriginals were shot dead in retaliation. The\nAboriginals fled down the river as the troopers regrouped, rearmed and pursued\nthem, led by the second-in-command, Lieutenant George Cobban. Cobban's party\nfound their quarry about a mile down the river at a point now known as\nWaterloo Creek, where a second engagement took place. The encounter lasted\nseveral hours and no Aboriginals were captured.\n\n### 'Disproportionate force'\n\nAs there had been no declaration of martial law or other authorising\nlegislation, the police lacked authority to use more than reasonable force\nproportionate to any risk to the safety of persons or property. Nobody had a\nlicence to kill. The troopers may therefore have used disproportionate force\ndirected towards individuals who posed little or no risk. \"There was a\nsuspicion that the troopers might have acted as an ill-disciplined military\nforce rather than as a regular police force.\"\n\n## Official inquiry\n\nOn 5 March 1838, Nunn submitted a report on his expedition to the newly\narrived Governor Gipps. Within the following month the Colony's Executive\nCouncil (the Colonial government constituted by the Governor and his advisers)\naccepted a recommendation of their Attorney General, Mr J. H. Plunkett, that\nthere be an official inquiry into the expedition, including the Aboriginal\ndeaths. The colonial government and the Colonial Office in England were both\nconscious of a need to extend the rule of law to Aboriginals as well as other\n\"British subjects\" in the Colony. On 6 April 1838 the Executive Council\ndecided to issue regulations in the form of a government notice announcing\nthat there would be an inquiry (that is, a coronial inquiry) into the death of\nany Aboriginal at the hands of a Colonist in the same way as that held when\nthe death of a Colonist occurred through violence or suddenly. However, the\ndecision to publish this Inquiry notice was delayed, with the Executive\nCouncil deciding to defer publication until after \"public excitement\" (about\nthe Myall Creek murderers' executions) had abated. On 14 August 1838 the\nLegislative Council appointed a Committee of Inquiry into \"the present state\nof Aborigines\", to be presided over by the Anglican Bishop, William Broughton.\nGipps's own inquiry into the Nunn expedition was delayed. He claimed to be\nunable to produce eyewitness evidence from mounted police owing to deman\nDoc 3(Title: eated a painting of the massacre, based on a) Rorschach ink blot, a technique he had used in previous paintings, entitled\nMyall Creek Rorschach.

The poem expresses Dunlop's sorrow over\nthe massacre and expresses sympathy for the Aboriginals of Australia. Dunlop\nresponded to criticism by the Sydney Herald, arguing on behalf of the poem and\nexplaining why her views were correct. John Henry Fleming, the leader of the\nmassacre, hid on a relative's property inland from Moreton Bay, and was never\ncaptured. He later became a respected farmer and church warden in the\nHawkesbury district. John Blake, one of the four men acquitted at the first\ntrial and not subsequently charged, committed suicide in 1852. One of his\ndescendants likes to think he did so out of a guilty conscience. The Myall\nCreek massacre is often cited as the only massacre of its kind in colonial\nAustralia for which white people were subsequently executed. However, there is\nat least one case prior to Myall Creek. In 1820, two convicts, John Kirby and\nJohn Thompson, attempted to escape from the colony but were captured by local\nAborigines and returned to Newcastle. A military party accompanied by two\nconstables set out to meet them and Kirby was seen by the party to stab\nBurragong (alias King Jack) whereupon he was felled by a waddy. Burragong\ninitially appeared to recover, stating that he was murry bujjery (much\nrecovered) and collected his reward of a \"suit of clothing\". However, he later\ncomplained of illness and died from his wound ten days after being injured.\nKirby and Thompson were both tried for \"willful murder\". All the European\nwitnesses testified that \"no blow was struck by any native\" before Kirby\nattacked Burragong. Thompson was acquitted, but Kirby was found guilty and\nsentenced to death, with his body to be \"dissected and anatomized\". The Myall\nCreek massacre was just the latest of many massacres that took place in that\ndistrict (the Liverpool Plains) around that time. As elsewhere in the colony,\nthe Aborigines at times resisted the expanding invasion of their land by\nspearing sheep and cattle for food and sometimes attacking the stockmen's huts\nand killing the white men. In the Liverpool Plains district there had been\nsome cattle speared and huts attacked and two whites murdered (allegedly by\nAborigines). The squatters complained to Acting Governor Snodgrass, who sent\nMajor James Nunn and about 22 troopers up to the district. Nunn enlisted the\nassistance of up to 25 local stockmen and together they rode around the\ndistrict murdering any Aborigines they came across. Nunn's campaign culminated\nin the Australia Day Massacre of 1838 at Waterloo Creek. Although no\ndefinitive historical records are available, estimates of Aborigines murdered\nrange from 40 to over 100. When Nunn returned to Sydney, many of the local\nsquatters and stockmen continued the \"drive\" against the Aborigines, including\nthe Myall Creek massacre. However, because of community outrage, Governor\nGipps did not encourage further prosecutions, including for the earlier\nWaterloo Creek massacre, nor the later McIntyre's Station massacre, both of\nwhich apparently involved a greater number of Aboriginal deaths. In his book,\nBlood on the Wattle, travel journalist Bruce Elder says that the successful\nprosecutions resulted in pacts of silence becoming a common practice to avoid\nsufficient evidence becoming available for future prosecutions. Another\neffect, as two Sydney newspapers reported, was that poisoning Aborigines\nbecame more common as being \"much safer\". Many massacres were to go unpunished\ndue to these practices, as what is variously called a 'conspiracy' or 'pact'\nor 'code' of silence fell over the killings of Abo\nDoc 5(Title: rosecutions. Another) effect, as two Sydney newspapers reported, was that poisoning Aborigines\nbecame more common as being \"much safer\". Many massacres were to go unpunished\ndue to these practices, as what is variously called a 'conspiracy' or 'pact'\nor 'code' of silence fell over the killings of Aborigines. The Myall Creek\nmassacre and the subsequent trial and hanging of some of the offenders had a\nprofound effect on the \"outside\" settlers and their dealing with Indigenous\npeople throughout all sections the colonial Australian frontiers. The Sydney\nHerald and the spokesmen for the settlers in the remote districts of New South\nWales and Victoria, frequently leading men such as William Wentworth,\ntypically classified the trial and execution of the offenders as \"judicial\nmurder\". Similar opinions were voiced years later in Queensland, the most\npopulated section of the continent in terms of Indigenous people, where it was\nthe subject of numerous statements in the then newly separated parliament. In\n1861, there was almost unanimous agreement that the prosecution and hanging in\n1838 had been nothing less than '...judicial murder of white men in Sydney',\nas the government spokesman Robert Ramsay Mackenzie phrased it in his speech\nin the Legislative Assembly on 25 July, and that 'white troopers were\n\"useless\" as they could not be \"acting against the blackfellows as they\nwished, lest an outcry should be raised against them, and they could be\nprosecuted for murder\". Arthur Macalister, spokesman for the opposition (later\nthree times Premier of Queensland) agreed, equally using the term \"judicial\nmurder\". The notion seemingly almost unanimously agreed to by the first\nQueensland parliament was that no white man should ever be prosecuted in\nQueensland for the killing of a black.\n\n## Stockyard controversy\n\nOver the years there has been some debate over the exact location of the\nmassacre. An oral tradition developed among stockmen who worked on the Myall\nCreek station, many years after the massacre actually occurred, that it had\nhappened in a stockyard to which the Wirrayaraay were led by the stockmen.\nAlthough this oral tradition is very strongly held by some local descendants\nof the stockmen and others, there is no primary source evidence from the time\nto support the idea. All the evidence collected by Police Magistrate Edward\nDenny Day and provided in evidence at the two trials contradicts the\nsuggestion that it occurred in a stockyard. Witnesses William Hobbs, Thomas\nFoster, Andrew Burrowes and Edward Denny Day himself describe the massacre\nsite without making any mention of a stockyard. Hobbs stated in evidence to\nthe Supreme Court that the stockyard was close to the huts whereas the\nmassacre site was \"about half a mile from my house in a westerly direction\".\nHistorians dismiss the stockyard as the location of the massacre as a \"bush\nmyth\".\n\n## Memorial\n\nA memorial to the victims of the massacre was unveiled on 10 June 2000,\nconsisting of a granite rock and plaque overlooking the site of the massacre.\nA ceremony is held each year on 10 June commemorating the victims. The\nmemorial was vandalised in January 2005, with the words \"murder\", \"women\" and\n\"children\" chiselled off, in an attempt to make it unreadable. The location is\ndescribed as 23 km north east of Bingara at the junction of Bingara-Delungra\nand Whitlow Roads. The Myall Creek Massacre and Memorial Site was included on\nthe Australian National Heritage List on 7 June 2008 and the New South Wales\nState Heritage Register on 12 November 2010. The memorial is maintained and\nfunded by the Friends of Myall Creek, an Australian non-profit organisation.\n\n## Painting\n\nSydney artist Ben Quilty created a painting of the massacre, based on a\nRorschach ink blot, a technique he had used in previous paintings, entitled\nMyall Creek Rorschach. He consulted Gamilaraay elders Aunty Sue Blacklock and\nUncle Lyall Munro before commencing his sketches for the work.

Selke Trophy\n\n          * Steve \nDoc 2(Title: # Elias Pettersson) \nElias Fredrik Pettersson (born 12 November 1998) is a Swedish professional ice\nhockey player for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPettersson was selected fifth overall by the Canucks in the 2017 NHL Entry\nDraft. He was born in Sundsvall, Sweden, but grew up in Ånge, Sweden. After\none of the greatest U20 seasons in SHL history in 2017–18 and winning the Le\nMat Trophy with the Växjö Lakers, Pettersson made the Canucks opening night\nroster for the 2018–19 season. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the\nleague's best rookie in 2019, becoming the second Canuck to do so after Pavel\nBure in 1992.\n\n## Playing career\n\n### Sweden\n\nPettersson played hockey as a youth and made his professional debut with Timrå\nIK of the HockeyAllsvenskan. In his second season in the Allsvenskan in\n2016–17, Pettersson placed second on the team in scoring with 41 points in 43\ngames. Unable to help Timrå IK gain promotion, Pettersson signed a three-year\ncontract with the Växjö Lakers of the top tier SHL, on 6 April 2017.\nPettersson was ranked second among European skaters by the NHL Central\nScouting Bureau in his first year of eligibility for the 2017 NHL Entry Draft.\nHe was selected as the first Swedish player taken in the draft, fifth overall,\nby the Vancouver Canucks, joining former linemate and Canucks prospect\nJonathan Dahlén on 23 June 2017. It was speculated the Canucks drafted\nPettersson based partly on highly successful chemistry with Dahlén on the top\nline for Timrå IK, where they finished fifth and ninth in league scoring as\nteenagers. The two scored on the first shift they ever played together in\nSweden. While still a junior player, Pettersson dominated the Swedish Hockey\nLeague in his 2017–18 rookie season. In 44 games played, he led the league in\nboth points scored and in +/- at the end of the regular season, with 56 points\n(1.27 average) and +27 respectively. He also scored 24 goals, second in the\nleague behind Frölunda's Victor Olofsson. In the penultimate game of the\n2017–18 season, Pettersson recorded four points to reach 55 points for the\nseason. In the season finale, Pettersson scored a goal to set a new record 56\nfor most points by a junior in a single SHL/Elitserien season, previously held\nby Kent Nilsson (set in 1975–76). Pettersson went on to lead the playoffs in\nboth goal-scoring, points, and +/-, with 10 goals, 19 points (1.46 average)\nand +17 respectively, in 13 games played. Scoring four game-winning goals, he\nled Växjö Lakers to the team's second Le Mat Trophy. Counting both the regular\nseason and the playoffs, Pettersson scored 34 goals and 41 assists, for a\ntotal of 75 points in 57 games played (1.32 average). In April 2018,\nPettersson was awarded the Stefan Liv Memorial Trophy, as the SHL playoffs'\nMVP, by SICO (Sweden's Ice hockey players Central Organisation). All 14 jury\nmembers voted unanimously for Pettersson, a first in the award's nine year\nhistory. At the SHL Awards, Pettersson was named Rookie of the Year, and\nForward of the Year.\n\n### NHL\n\n#### Vancouver Canucks\n\nOn 25 May 2018, the Canucks signed Pettersson to a three-year entry-level\ncontract. On 3 October 2018, Pettersson made his NHL debut against the Calgary\nFlames. Pettersson scored his first career goal against goaltender Mike Smith,\nand also recorded an assist in a 5–2 Canucks win. On 13 October 2018, during a\ngame against the Florida Panthers, Pettersson suffered a head injury on a hit\nfrom Panthers defenceman Mike Matheson resulting in Pettersson leaving the\ngame. Although Matheson was not penalized for the hit, the NHL Department of\nPlayer Safety believed that Matheson had an intent to injure, resulting in him\nbeing suspended two games and fined $52,419.36. Pettersson returned to the\nlineup on 27 October after missing six games; the Canucks lost 5–0 to the\nPittsburgh Penguins. Two nights later, Pettersson scored two goals in a 5–2\nwin over the Minnesota Wild. On 1 November, Pettersson was named the October\nRoo\nDoc 3(Title:  and Tim Coulis (18th overall))         * 1979: Mike Gartner (4th overall)\n        * 1980: Darren Veitch (5th overall)\n        * 1981: Bob Carpenter (3rd overall)\n        * 1982: Scott Stevens (5th overall)\n        * 1983: None\n        * 1984: Kevin Hatcher (17th overall)\n        * 1985: Yvon Corriveau (19th overall)\n        * 1986: Jeff Greenlaw (19th overall)\n        * 1987: None\n        * 1988: Reggie Savage (15th overall)\n        * 1989: Olaf Kolzig (19th overall)\n        * 1990: John Slaney (9th overall)\n        * 1991: Pat Peake (14th overall) and Trevor Halverson (21st overall)\n        * 1992: Sergei Gonchar (14th overall)\n        * 1993: Brendan Witt (11th overall) and Jason Allison (17th overall)\n        * 1994: Nolan Baumgartner (10th overall) and Alexander Kharlamov (15th overall)\n        * 1995: Brad Church (17th overall) and Miika Elomo (23rd overall)\n        * 1996: Alexandre Volchkov (4th overall) and Jaroslav Svejkovsky (17th overall)\n        * 1997: Nick Boynton (9th overall)\n        * 1998: None\n        * 1999: Kris Beech (7th overall)\n        * 2000: Brian Sutherby (26th overall)\n        * 2001: None\n        * 2002: Steve Eminger (12th overall), Alexander Semin (13th overall), and Boyd Gordon (17th overall)\n        * 2003: Eric Fehr (18th overall)\n        * 2004: Alexander Ovechkin (1st overall), Jeff Schultz (27th overall), and Mike Green (29th overall)\n        * 2005: Sasha Pokulok (14th overall) and Joe Finley (27th overall)\n        * 2006: Nicklas Backstrom (4th overall) and Semyon Varlamov (23rd overall)\n        * 2007: Karl Alzner (5th overall)\n        * 2008: Anton Gustafsson (21st overall) and John Carlson (27th overall)\n        * 2009: Marcus Johansson (24th overall)\n        * 2010: Evgeny Kuznetsov (26th overall)\n        * 2011: None (pick traded to Chicago Blackhawks for Troy Brouwer)\n        * 2012: Filip Forsberg (11th overall) and Tom Wilson (16th overall)\n        * 2013: Andre Burakovsky (23rd overall)\n        * 2014: Jakub Vrana (13th overall)\n        * 2015: Ilya Samsonov (22nd overall)\n        * 2016: Lucas Johansen (28th overall)\n        * 2017: None\n        * 2018: Alexander Alexeyev (31st overall)\n        * 2019: Connor McMichael (25th overall)\n\n### Hall of Fame members\n\nThe Washington Capitals hold an affiliation with a number of inductees to the\nHockey Hall of Fame.

    "question": "Where did the saying dressed up to the nines come from?",
    "agent_answer": "<answer> The saying \"dressed to the nines\" originates from Scots, dating back to the 18th century. It is believed to have been associated with the Nine Worthies or the nine Muses, as evidenced by its appearance in poems from the 17th and 18th centuries. The phrase suggests dressing in the finest manner possible, akin to being dressed up to perfection. It likely evolved from the idea of wearing items associated with the ideal or perfect, such as the nine muses, to describing someone who is impeccably dressed. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo answer where the saying \"dressed up to the nines\" comes from, I need to gather the origin of this phrase.\n</think>\n<search>origin of the saying dressed up to the nines</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: # To the nines) \n\"To the nines\" is an English idiom meaning \"to perfection\" or \"to the highest\ndegree\" or to dress \"buoyantly and high class\". In modern English usage, the\nphrase most commonly appears as \"dressed to the nines\" or \"dressed up to the\nnines\".\n\n## Origin\n\nThe phrase is said to be Scots in origin. The earliest written example of the\nphrase is from the 1719 Epistle to Ramsay by the Scottish poet William\nHamilton: The bonny Lines therein thou sent me, How to the nines they did\ncontent me.  Robert Burns' \"Poem on Pastoral Poetry\", published posthumously\nin 1800, also uses the phrase: Thou paints auld nature to the nines, In thy\nsweet Caledonian lines.  The phrase may have originally been associated with\nthe Nine Worthies or the nine Muses. A poem from a 17th century collection of\nworks by John Rawlet contains the following lines: The learned tribe whose\nworks the World do bless, Finish those works in some recess; Both the\nPhilosopher and Divine, And Poets most who still make their address In private\nto the Nine.\n\n## References\nDoc 2(Title: # The whole nine yards) \n\"The whole nine yards\" or \"the full nine yards\" is a colloquial American\nEnglish phrase meaning \"everything, the whole lot\" or, when used as an\nadjective, \"all the way\", as in, \"The Army came out and gave us the whole nine\nyards on how they use space systems.\" Its origin is unknown and has been\ndescribed by Yale University librarian Fred R. Shapiro as \"the most prominent\netymological riddle of our time\". The Oxford English Dictionary finds the\nearliest published non-idiomatic use in an 1855 Indiana newspaper article. The\nearliest known idiomatic use of the phrase is from 1907 in Southern Indiana.\nThe phrase is related to the expression the whole six yards, used around the\nsame time in Kentucky and South Carolina. Both phrases are variations on the\nwhole ball of wax, first recorded in the 1880s. They are part of a family of\nexpressions in which an odd-sounding item, such as enchilada, shooting match,\nshebang or hog, is substituted for ball of wax. The choice of the number nine\nmay be related to the expression \"To the nines\" (to perfection). Use of the\nphrase became widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. Much of the interest in the\nphrase's etymology can be attributed to New York Times language columnist\nWilliam Safire, who wrote extensively on this question.\n\n## History of the phrase\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary places the earliest published non-idiomatic use\nof the phrase in the New Albany Daily Ledger (New Albany, Indiana, January 30,\n1855) in an article called \"The Judge's Big Shirt.\" \"What a silly, stupid\nwoman! I told her to get just enough to make three shirts; instead of making\nthree, she has put the whole nine yards into one shirt!\" The first known use\nof the phrase as an idiom appears in The Mitchell Commercial, a newspaper in\nthe small town of Mitchell, Indiana, in its May 2, 1907 edition: This\nafternoon at 2:30 will be called one of the baseball games that will be worth\ngoing a long way to see. The regular nine is going to play the business men as\nmany innings as they can stand, but we can not promise the full nine yards.\nThe idiom was used three more times in the Mitchell Commercial over the next\nseven years, in the forms give him the whole nine yards (i.e., tell someone a\nbig story), take the whole nine yards (i.e., take everything), and settled the\nwhole nine yards (i.e., resolved everything). In other uses from this time\nperiod, the phrase was given as the whole six yards. In 1912, a local\nnewspaper in Kentucky asked readers to, \"Just wait boys until the fix gets to\na fever heat and they will tell the whole six yards.\" The same newspaper\nrepeated the phrase soon afterward in another issue, stating \"As we have been\ngone for a few days and failed to get all the news for this issue we will give\nyou the whole six yards in our next.\" The six-yard form of the phrase also\nappears in a 1921 headline in a local South Carolina paper. The phrase is not\nknown to have been used in writing thereafter until a 1956 issue of Kentucky\nHappy Hunting Ground, where it appears in an article on fishing. After\ndescribing the contests and prizes, the author writes, \"So that's the whole\nnine-yards.\" It appeared in an article on hunting the following year, this\ntime unhyphenated. The phrase at this point was still rare. There is strong\ncircumstantial evidence it was not in general use in 1961, as Ralph Boston set\na world record for the long jump that year at 27 feet, or nine yards, but no\nnews report has been found that made any reference to the term, suggesting\nthat journalists were unaware of it or did not regard it as common enough to\nuse as a pun. In a short story published in 1962, the phrase is attributed to\n\"a brush salesman\". A letter published in an auto magazine later that year\ndescribes a certain new car as containing \"all nine yards of goodies\". In\n1964, several newspapers published a syndicated story which explained that\n\"Give 'em the whole nine yards\" was NASA talk for an item-by-item report. This\nearly \nDoc 3(Title: nce 1918, soup and fish - a term) derived from the sort of food thought to be served at black tie dinners.\n\n## History\n\n### British origins in the 19th century\n\nIn the 1860s, the increasing popularity of outdoor activities among the middle\nand upper classes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland led to a\ncorresponding increase in the popularity of the then casual lounge suit\n(standard suit in American English) as a country alternative to the more\nformal day wear frock coat that was traditionally worn in town. Men also\nsought a similar alternative to the formal evening tailcoat (then known as a\n\"dress coat\") worn every evening. The earliest record of a tailless coat being\nworn with evening wear is a 1865 midnight blue smoking jacket in silk with\nmatching trousers ordered by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the\nUnited Kingdom) from Savile Row tailors Henry Poole & Co. The smoking jacket\nwas tailored for use at Sandringham, the British Royal Family's informal\ncountry estate. Henry Poole never saw his design become known as a dinner\njacket or cross the Atlantic and be called a tuxedo over there; he died in\n1876 leaving behind a well-respected business to be run by his cousin Samuel\nCundey. Other accounts of the Prince's experimentation appear around 1885\nvariously referring to \"a garment of many colours, such as was worn by our\nancestors\" and \"short garments coming down to the waist and made on the model\nof the military men's jackets\". The garment as we know it (suit jacket with\ntailcoat finishes) was first described around the same time and often\nassociated with Cowes, a seaside resort in southern England and centre of\nBritish yachting that was closely associated with the Prince. It was\noriginally intended for warm weather use but soon spread to informal or stag\nwinter occasions. As it was simply an evening tailcoat substitute, it was worn\nwith all the same accoutrements as the tailcoat, including the trousers. As\nsuch, in these early days, black tie (in contrast to formal white tie) was\nconsidered informal wear. In the following decades of the Victorian era, the\nstyle became known as a dinner jacket: a fashionable, formal alternative for\nthe tailcoat which men of the upper classes wore every evening. Thus it was\nworn with the standard accompaniments for the evening tailcoat at the time:\nmatching trousers, white or black waistcoat, white bow tie, white detachable\nwing-collar formal shirt and black formal shoes. Lapels were often faced or\nedged in silk or satin in varying widths. In comparison with full dress\n(cutaway tailcoat), etiquette guides declared dinner jacket inappropriate for\nwear in mixed company, meaning together with ladies. During the Edwardian era,\nthe practice of wearing a black waistcoat and black bow tie with a dinner\njacket became the convention, establishing the basis of the current black tie\nand white tie dress codes. The dinner jacket was also increasingly accepted at\nless formal evening occasions such as warm-weather gatherings or intimate\ndinners with friends. After the World War I, the dinner jacket became\nestablished as a semi-formal evening wear, while the evening tailcoat was\nlimited to the most formal or ceremonial occasions. During this interwar\nperiod, double-breasted jackets, turndown-collar shirts and cummerbunds became\npopular for black tie evenings as white jackets where experimented with in\nwarm weather. Since then, black tie is often referred to as being semi-formal.\nIn the decades following the World War II, black tie became special occasion\nattire rather than standard evening wear. In the 1950s, some experimented with\ncoloured and patterned jackets, cummerbunds and bow ties.

The custom dates back at least as far as the 15th century and was\nfound in parts of England, Flanders, Germany and Austria.

In modern English usage, the\nphrase most commonly appears as \"dressed to the nines\" or \"dressed up to the\nnines\".\n\n## Origin\n\nThe phrase is said to be Scots in origin. The earliest written example of the\nphrase is from the 1719 Epistle to Ramsay by the Scottish poet William\nHamilton: The bonny Lines therein thou sent me, How to the nines they did\ncontent me.  Robert Burns' \"Poem on Pastoral Poetry\", published posthumously\nin 1800, also uses the phrase: Thou paints auld nature to the nines, In thy\nsweet Caledonian lines.  The phrase may have originally been associated with\nthe Nine Worthies or the nine Muses. A poem from a 17th century collection of\nworks by John Rawlet contains the following lines: The learned tribe whose\nworks the World do bless, Finish those works in some recess; Both the\nPhilosopher and Divine, And Poets most who still make their address In private\nto the Nine.\n\n## References\nDoc 2(Title: # The whole nine yards) \n\"The whole nine yards\" or \"the full nine yards\" is a colloquial American\nEnglish phrase meaning \"everything, the whole lot\" or, when used as an\nadjective, \"all the way\", as in, \"The Army came out and gave us the whole nine\nyards on how they use space systems.\" Its origin is unknown and has been\ndescribed by Yale University librarian Fred R. Shapiro as \"the most prominent\netymological riddle of our time\". The Oxford English Dictionary finds the\nearliest published non-idiomatic use in an 1855 Indiana newspaper article. The\nearliest known idiomatic use of the phrase is from 1907 in Southern Indiana.\nThe phrase is related to the expression the whole six yards, used around the\nsame time in Kentucky and South Carolina. Both phrases are variations on the\nwhole ball of wax, first recorded in the 1880s. They are part of a family of\nexpressions in which an odd-sounding item, such as enchilada, shooting match,\nshebang or hog, is substituted for ball of wax. The choice of the number nine\nmay be related to the expression \"To the nines\" (to perfection). Use of the\nphrase became widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. Much of the interest in the\nphrase's etymology can be attributed to New York Times language columnist\nWilliam Safire, who wrote extensively on this question.\n\n## History of the phrase\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary places the earliest published non-idiomatic use\nof the phrase in the New Albany Daily Ledger (New Albany, Indiana, January 30,\n1855) in an article called \"The Judge's Big Shirt.\" \"What a silly, stupid\nwoman! I told her to get just enough to make three shirts; instead of making\nthree, she has put the whole nine yards into one shirt!\" The first known use\nof the phrase as an idiom appears in The Mitchell Commercial, a newspaper in\nthe small town of Mitchell, Indiana, in its May 2, 1907 edition: This\nafternoon at 2:30 will be called one of the baseball games that will be worth\ngoing a long way to see. The regular nine is going to play the business men as\nmany innings as they can stand, but we can not promise the full nine yards.\nThe idiom was used three more times in the Mitchell Commercial over the next\nseven years, in the forms give him the whole nine yards (i.e., tell someone a\nbig story), take the whole nine yards (i.e., take everything), and settled the\nwhole nine yards (i.e., resolved everything). In other uses from this time\nperiod, the phrase was given as the whole six yards. In 1912, a local\nnewspaper in Kentucky asked readers to, \"Just wait boys until the fix gets to\na fever heat and they will tell the whole six yards.\" The same newspaper\nrepeated the phrase soon afterward in another issue, stating \"As we have been\ngone for a few days and failed to get all the news for this issue we will give\nyou the whole six yards in our next.\" The six-yard form of the phrase also\nappears in a 1921 headline in a local South Carolina paper. The phrase is not\nknown to have been used in writing thereafter until a 1956 issue of Kentucky\nHappy Hunting Ground, where it appears in an article on fishing. After\ndescribing the contests and prizes, the author writes, \"So that's the whole\nnine-yards.\" It appeared in an article on hunting the following year, this\ntime unhyphenated. The phrase at this point was still rare. There is strong\ncircumstantial evidence it was not in general use in 1961, as Ralph Boston set\na world record for the long jump that year at 27 feet, or nine yards, but no\nnews report has been found that made any reference to the term, suggesting\nthat journalists were unaware of it or did not regard it as common enough to\nuse as a pun. In a short story published in 1962, the phrase is attributed to\n\"a brush salesman\". A letter published in an auto magazine later that year\ndescribes a certain new car as containing \"all nine yards of goodies\". In\n1964, several newspapers published a syndicated story which explained that\n\"Give 'em the whole nine yards\" was NASA talk for an item-by-item report.

Men also\nsought a similar alternative to the formal evening tailcoat (then known as a\n\"dress coat\") worn every evening. The earliest record of a tailless coat being\nworn with evening wear is a 1865 midnight blue smoking jacket in silk with\nmatching trousers ordered by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the\nUnited Kingdom) from Savile Row tailors Henry Poole & Co. The smoking jacket\nwas tailored for use at Sandringham, the British Royal Family's informal\ncountry estate. Henry Poole never saw his design become known as a dinner\njacket or cross the Atlantic and be called a tuxedo over there; he died in\n1876 leaving behind a well-respected business to be run by his cousin Samuel\nCundey. Other accounts of the Prince's experimentation appear around 1885\nvariously referring to \"a garment of many colours, such as was worn by our\nancestors\" and \"short garments coming down to the waist and made on the model\nof the military men's jackets\". The garment as we know it (suit jacket with\ntailcoat finishes) was first described around the same time and often\nassociated with Cowes, a seaside resort in southern England and centre of\nBritish yachting that was closely associated with the Prince. It was\noriginally intended for warm weather use but soon spread to informal or stag\nwinter occasions. As it was simply an evening tailcoat substitute, it was worn\nwith all the same accoutrements as the tailcoat, including the trousers. As\nsuch, in these early days, black tie (in contrast to formal white tie) was\nconsidered informal wear. In the following decades of the Victorian era, the\nstyle became known as a dinner jacket: a fashionable, formal alternative for\nthe tailcoat which men of the upper classes wore every evening. Thus it was\nworn with the standard accompaniments for the evening tailcoat at the time:\nmatching trousers, white or black waistcoat, white bow tie, white detachable\nwing-collar formal shirt and black formal shoes. Lapels were often faced or\nedged in silk or satin in varying widths. In comparison with full dress\n(cutaway tailcoat), etiquette guides declared dinner jacket inappropriate for\nwear in mixed company, meaning together with ladies. During the Edwardian era,\nthe practice of wearing a black waistcoat and black bow tie with a dinner\njacket became the convention, establishing the basis of the current black tie\nand white tie dress codes. The dinner jacket was also increasingly accepted at\nless formal evening occasions such as warm-weather gatherings or intimate\ndinners with friends. After the World War I, the dinner jacket became\nestablished as a semi-formal evening wear, while the evening tailcoat was\nlimited to the most formal or ceremonial occasions. During this interwar\nperiod, double-breasted jackets, turndown-collar shirts and cummerbunds became\npopular for black tie evenings as white jackets where experimented with in\nwarm weather.

The tagline to this\nmovie is \"I Wish I May, I Wish I Might, Become My Sister For A Night!\"\n\n## Plot\n\nThe two Wheaton sisters share a household and a high school, but both feel\nthat they have little else in common. 18-year-old Alexia's (Katherine Heigl)\ndays revolve around being popular, dressing stylishly, and spending time with\nher jock boyfriend, while exerting minimal effort academically; her sister,\n15-year-old Hayley (Danielle Harris), is socially reserved, admiring her older\nsister's popularity from a distance while excelling in her studies,\nparticularly science and mathematics. Hayley and Alexia don't get along well\nat all, with Hayley resenting her reliance on her frequently late sister for a\nride to school and Alexia preferring not to be seen with her less-than-cool\nyounger sister. One night, Hayley is outside studying the night sky for her\nscience class, while Alexia relaxes in the outdoor hot tub with her boyfriend,\nKyle (Don Jeffcoat). When Hayley sees a shooting star, she wishes aloud to\nbecome her sister Alexia, then turns to see Alexia also watching the sky. The\ntwo of them awaken the next morning to find themselves trapped in each other's\nbodies. Hayley assumes responsibility for the swap, mentioning her wish.\nDistraught, Alexia forbids Hayley to go to school in her place, and she\ninstigates a variety of wish-making attempts for Hayley to reverse their\ncondition, all of which are unsuccessful. Hayley is content to fill her\nsister's role for the day, as she can now experience the glamor of Alexia's\nlife firsthand. After the first day ends, they realize that they may be stuck\nlike this for a while. They each spend the next day purposely trying to ruin\nanything important to the other, such as their social reputation and extra-\ncurricular activities. Hayley (in Alexia's body) wears the same outfit that\nshe had worn the day before, and Alexia (in Hayley's body) goes to school\ndressed up as a dominatrix. Their parents choose not to interfere, as they had\njust started a \"hands-off\" approach to parenting. Eventually Hayley and Alexia\nlearn to look at their lives with new perspective. As they each become\naccustomed to the other's life, they begin to relate to one another better and\nbecome closer as sisters. While spending an evening outside searching for a\nshooting star to make their wish to switch back, they decide to spend one more\nday as each other. Hayley's task (in Alexia's body) is to help convince her\nteachers that Alexia is not an \"airhead,\" and Alexia (in Hayley's body) is to\nhelp show Hayley how easily Hayley can get a guy. Hayley's and Alexia's plans\nwork, and they decide that it's time for them to switch back. Unfortunately,\nthat night they fall asleep early; Hayley wakes up during the night in time to\nwish on a star. When she awakens the next morning, she finds that they didn't\nswitch back and believes that they will never be able to return to their own\nbodies, but she doesn't tell Alexia. Alexia and Hayley attend the Winter\nFestival dance, where Hayley breaks down and tells Alexia that they can't\nswitch back. Alexia then confesses that she saw the first shooting star when\nshe was with Kyle and wished to be Hayley, since she had been jealous of\nHayley's intellect and well-structured plans for her future. Realizing that it\nwas their combined wishing that caused their switch, they sit outside and,\nseeing a shooting star, wish together to be themselves again. Opening their\neyes, they are delighted to see their wish has come true. They return to the\nWinter \nDoc 4(Title: # The Fault in Our Stars) \nThe Fault in Our Stars is a novel by John Green.

It caused considerable\ndamage in Colchester and the surrounding villages in Essex. In terms of\noverall destruction caused it is certainly the most destructive earthquake to\nhave hit the United Kingdom in at least the last 400 years, since the Dover\nStraits earthquake of 1580. At 9:18 am the earthquake struck, centred mainly\nin the villages of Wivenhoe, Abberton, Langenhoe, and Peldon causing the\nsurrounding area to rise and fall violently as the waves spread, lasting for\naround 20 seconds. Measuring 4.6 on the Richter magnitude scale, the effects\nwere felt across England, as well as in northern France and Belgium. The\nearthquake damaged about 1,250 buildings, including almost every building in\nWivenhoe and Abberton, and in settlements all the way to Ipswich. The medieval\nchurch in Langenhoe was significantly damaged, as were those in the villages\nof Layer-de-la-Haye, Layer Marney, Layer Breton, and Peldon. In Peldon, the\nlocal newspapers claimed that every building had been damaged in some way. The\nGuardian reported that the earthquake was greeted with terror by the people\nnear Colchester. There are some reports that between 3 and 5 people were\nkilled by the earthquake, but this has been disputed by other contemporary\naccounts. The Times reported damage \"in the many villages in the neighbourhood\nfrom Colchester to the sea coast\", with many poor people made homeless, and\nestimated the cost of the disaster at £10,000. It did, however, mention the\ndeath of a child at Rowhedge, attributed to the earthquake. Mary Saunders, of\nManningtree, drowned herself in the River Stour some days later. The large\nwaves caused by the earthquake destroyed many small craft. It is believed that\nthe earthquake resulted from movement along a fault in the ancient Palaeozoic\nrocks that underpin most of Essex, causing waves to propagate through the\noverlying Cretaceous and Tertiary layers. As is often the case, it is not\nalways the strongest earthquakes that cause the most damage, and the British\nGeological Survey estimates that the 1884 earthquake's magnitude was only\naround 4.6 on the Richter magnitude scale, compared with 6.1 for the 1931\nDogger Bank earthquake. Langenhoe Church was badly damaged. Masonry tumbled\noff the tower, crashing into the roof of the nave and chancel. The nearby\nrectory was also damaged.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of earthquakes in the United Kingdom\n  * List of historical earthquakes\n\n## References\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n## External links\n\n  * The Great Colchester Earthquake\n  * The effects of the earthquake on the area of Eastern Essex south of the River Blackwater\nDoc 2(Title: ude) 9.5) and the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Prince William Sound (Magnitude\n9.2). The only other recorded earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater were off\nKamchatka, Russia, on 4 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0) and Tōhoku, Japan\n(magnitude 9.1) in March 2011. Each of these megathrust earthquakes also\nspawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. In comparison to the 2004 Indian Ocean\nearthquake, the death toll from these earthquakes was significantly lower,\nprimarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near\naffected areas, the much greater distances to more populated coasts, and the\nsuperior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs (More Economically\nDeveloped Countries) such as Japan. Other very large megathrust earthquakes\noccurred in 1868 (Peru, Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1827 (Colombia,\nNazca Plate and South American Plate); 1812 (Venezuela, Caribbean Plate and\nSouth American Plate) and 1700 (western North America, Juan de Fuca Plate and\nNorth American Plate). All of them are believed to be greater than magnitude\n9, but no accurate measurements were available at the time.\n\n### Tectonic plates\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and\ngeological extent. An estimated of fault surface slipped (or ruptured) about\nalong the subduction zone where the Indian Plate slides (or subducts) under\nthe overriding Burma Plate. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took\nplace in two phases over several minutes: Seismographic and acoustic data\nindicate that the first phase involved a rupture about long and wide, beneath\nthe sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an\nearthquake. The rupture proceeded at about , beginning off the coast of Aceh\nand proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds. After a pause of about\nanother 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the Andaman and\nNicobar Islands. The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south,\nat about , continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where\nthe fault type changes from subduction to strike-slip (the two plates slide\npast one another in opposite directions). The Indian Plate is part of the\ngreat Indo-Australian Plate, which underlies the Indian Ocean and Bay of\nBengal, and is moving north-east at an average of . The India Plate meets the\nBurma Plate (which is considered a portion of the great Eurasian Plate) at the\nSunda Trench. At this point the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate,\nwhich carries the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands, and northern Sumatra.\nThe India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the\nincreasing temperature and pressure drive volatiles out of the subducting\nplate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate, causing partial melting\nand the formation of magma. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and\nexits the Earth's crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The\nvolcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian Plate subducts the\nEurasian Plate has created the Sunda Arc. As well as the sideways movement\nbetween the plates, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake resulted in a rise of the\nsea floor by several metres, displacing an estimated of water and triggering\ndevastating tsunami waves. The waves radiated outwards along the entire length\nof the rupture (acting as a line source). This greatly increased the\ngeographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as\nMexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the sea floor significantly\nreduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the\nglobal sea level by an estimated .\n\n### Aftershocks and other earthquakes\n\nNumerous aftershocks were reported off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar\nIslands and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that\nfollowed. The magnitude 8.7 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated\noff the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is \nDoc 3(Title: # 1755 Cape Ann earthquake) \nThe 1755 Cape Ann earthquake took place off the coast of the British Province\nof Massachusetts Bay (present-day Massachusetts) on November 18. At between\n6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, it remains the largest earthquake in the\nhistory of Massachusetts. No one was killed, but it damaged hundreds of\nbuildings in Boston and was felt as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south\nas South Carolina. Sailors on a ship more than offshore felt the quake, and\nmistook it at first for their ship running aground. Many residents of Boston\nand the surrounding areas attributed the quake to God, and it occasioned a\nbrief increase in religious fervor in the city. Modern studies estimate that\nif a similar quake shook Boston today, it would result in as much as $5\nbillion in damage and hundreds of deaths. Some discussion has revolved around\nthe idea that this may have been a remotely triggered event.\n\n## Epicenter\n\nThe earthquake took place on November 18, 1755, at approximately 4:30 AM local\ntime. Its epicenter is believed to have been offshore, approximately east of\nCape Ann. The quake was felt as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia, south to\nthe Chesapeake Bay and South Carolina, and from Lake George and Lake Champlain\nin the northwest to a ship off the east coast. Sailors on the ship reported\nthat the quake was so strong, they had feared that they had run aground. The\nregion experienced several aftershocks, the first of which was a little more\nthan an hour after the quake. Most of these aftershocks could not be felt in\nBoston, affecting only the northeastern coast of the colony. Modern research\nhas estimated that the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and\nthe United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake in the\nhistory of Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and\nother quakes in the northeastern United States. There are a number of old\nfaults in the region, but none of them are known still to be active. It is\npossible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a\nlarger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is\nnot enough evidence to prove that they are linked.\n\n## Damage\n\nBoston and Cape Ann were the most heavily damaged. In Boston, damage was\nconcentrated in areas of infill near the harbor; infill is less sturdy in\nearthquakes than solid land. From 1,300 to 1,600 chimneys in the city were\ndamaged in some way, the gable ends of some houses collapsed, and a number of\nroofs were damaged by falling chimneys. Stone chimneys and buildings were\ndamaged in Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine), Springfield, Massachusetts,\nand New Haven, Connecticut, as well. Some church steeples in Boston were\ndamaged, ending up tilted from vertical. Stone fencing in rural areas was\ndamaged. Observers also reported that several springs dried up, new ones were\ncreated, and cracks appeared in the ground near Scituate, Lancaster, and\nPembroke. In this last town, observers noted water and fine sand coming from\nthe crack. Non-structural damage was minor; residents reported damage to china\nand glassware, and a distiller lost some of his product after a cistern was\ndamaged. The Cape Ann earthquake may also have created the first recorded\ntsunami in U.S. history. Observers in the Leeward Islands nearly south of Cape\nAnn, reported a receding of water followed by a large wave that lifted several\nboats ashore and left fish floundering on the beach.\n\n## Legacy\n\nMany Massachusetts residents of the time perceived the quake as punishment\nfrom God for immoral behavior. In the days after the earthquake, special\nprayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number\nof sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including\nJeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of\nNovember, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of\nhis Just Displeasure.

Various studies have placed it at 9.4–9.6 on the moment magnitude\nscale. It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 GMT, 15:11 local time), and lasted\napproximately 10 minutes. The resulting tsunami affected southern Chile,\nHawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and\nthe Aleutian Islands. The epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near\nLumaco, approximately south of Santiago, with Valdivia being the most affected\ncity. The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean\ncoast, with waves up to . The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean\nand devastated Hilo, Hawaii. Waves as high as were recorded from the\nepicenter, and as far away as Japan and the Philippines. The death toll and\nmonetary losses arising from this widespread disaster are not certain. Various\nestimates of the total number of fatalities from the earthquake and tsunamis\nhave been published, ranging between 1,000 and 7,000 killed. Different sources\nhave estimated the monetary cost ranged from 400 million to $800 million (or $\nto $ today, adjusted for inflation).\n\n## Earthquake sequence\n\n### Concepción earthquakes\n\nThe 1960 Chilean earthquakes were a sequence of strong earthquakes that\naffected Chile between 21 May and 6 June 1960, centered in the Araucanía,\nAysén, and Bío Bío regions of the country. The first three quakes, all\nregistering in the planet's top 10 by magnitude for 1960, are grouped together\nas the 1960 Concepción earthquakes. The first of these was the 8.1 M\nConcepción earthquake at on 21 May 1960. Its epicenter was near Curanilahue.\nTelecommunications to southern Chile were cut off and President Jorge\nAlessandri cancelled the traditional ceremony of the Battle of Iquique\nmemorial holiday to oversee the emergency assistance efforts. The second and\nthird Concepción earthquakes occurred the next day at (7.1 M) and (7.8 M) on\n22 May. These earthquakes formed a southward migrating foreshock sequence to\nthe main Valdivia shock, which occurred just 15 minutes after the third event.\nThe earthquake interrupted and effectively ended Lota's coal miners' march on\nConcepción as they demanded higher salaries.\n\n### Valdivia earthquake\n\nThe Valdivia earthquake occurred at 15:11 UTC-4 on 22 May, and affected all of\nChile between Talca and Chiloé Island, more than . Coastal villages, such as\nToltén, were struck. At Corral, the main port of Valdivia, the water level\nrose before it began to recede. At 16:20 UTC-4, a wave of struck the Chilean\ncoast, mainly between Concepción and Chiloé. Another wave measuring was\nreported ten minutes later. Hundreds of people were already reported dead by\nthe time the tsunami struck. One ship, Canelos, starting at the mouth of the\nValdivia River, sank after being moved backward and forward in the river; as\nof 2005, its mast was still visible from the road to Niebla. A number of\nSpanish-colonial fortifications were completely destroyed. Soil subsidence\nalso destroyed buildings, deepened local rivers, and created wetlands in such\nplaces as the Río Cruces and Chorocomayo, a new aquatic park north of the\ncity. Extensive areas of the city were flooded. The electricity and water\nsystems of Valdivia were totally destroyed. Witnesses reported underground\nwater flowing up through the soil.

When the colors of the two competing teams' home and away kits are too similar, making it difficult to distinguish players from each other. This is a common reason for using a third kit.\n2.

The kit can be a completely different design or a throwback to past designs.",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo answer when football teams wear their third kit, I need to consider if there's a specific occasion or rule for using a third kit. A third kit is typically used in addition to the home and away kits.\n</think>\n\n<search>when do football teams wear their third kit</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: ge unless alternative) arrangements are mutually agreed by the competing clubs\". Away kits were often\nsimilar as well, therefore third kits were worn in the 1948 FA Cup Final by\nManchester United and the 1950 final by Arsenal. Similar rules were employed\nby European governing body UEFA, with Manchester United winning the 1968\nEuropean Cup Final in a blue third kit. Teams sometimes needed to find\nmakeshift third kits for their players. One notable example being France\nhaving to wear the green-and-white stripes of local club C.A. Kimberley for\ntheir 1978 World Cup match against Hungary, as both teams were only equipped\nwith their white change shirts for the game. Third kits in international\nfootball are less common, both teams are typically advised to change colours\nin the event of a home kit clashing. England prepared light blue third kits\nfor the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, which was only worn for the former, and\nSpain introduced a white third kit for the 2014 World Cup at the insistence of\nFIFA. Since the 2000s, most clubs in major European leagues have used a third\nkit, or had one in reserve. Replicas of the kits are usually sold at club\nmerchandise shops. Sometimes, a previous season's away kit is retained if a\nclash arises. Clubs sometimes also assign a third kit as their secondary or\neven primary kit for certain competitions and vice versa. One notable incident\noccurred in 1996, when Manchester United changed into their blue and white\nthird kit – previously the away kit – at half-time, with manager Alex Ferguson\nblaming the grey away shirt for several sub-par performances. Ferguson\ncommented, \"The players couldn't pick each other out.[...] They said it was\ndifficult to see their team-mates at distance when they lifted their heads\".\n\n## Baseball\n\n### Major League Baseball\n\nAfter decades of wearing the same uniforms, Major League Baseball teams began\nto experiment with numerous designs in the early 1970s, ranging from popular\ndesigns (such as the Oakland Athletics' pullover jerseys that most MLB teams\nlater adopted) and not so popular (such as the Chicago White Sox wearing\nshorts, or the Cleveland Indians wearing all-red). Among such designs that\nwere also tested were third jerseys, to break the traditional mold that\nbaseball teams wear white uniforms at home, and gray on the road. This began\nin 1972 when the A's flamboyant owner, Charles O. Finley, introduced new\nuniforms to the team. Taking after the lead of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the\njerseys were pullover spandex that would later catch on in MLB (though this\nwould be phased out by the early 1990s in favor of the more traditional\nbutton-down jerseys), but by going one step further than the Pirates, the A's\nintroduced alternate gold and green jerseys. The gold jerseys, lighter in\ncolor, were considered \"home\" alternates while the darker green jerseys were\nconsidered \"away\" alternates. Soon, many teams caught on with different\ncolored jerseys. The Pirates even went as far as to having a rotation of which\njerseys to wear, matching white pinstriped, gold, and black pants to wear with\njerseys of the same color. The white pinstripes were later phased out in favor\nof solid white. The New York Yankees have generally shunned the practice of\nthird jerseys. The Yankees wore three different jerseys in 1911, 1916, and\nmost recently in 1943 according to the Dressed to the Nines database\nmaintained by the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In recent years, the Yankees\nhave worn throwback uniforms for single games in 1996 and 2012. Third jerseys\notherwise remain popular in baseball today, either as an alternate design or\nas a throwback known as \"Turn Back the Clock Night.\" The Milwaukee Brewers,\nfor example, have worn a variation of their 1978–1993 home uniforms for every\nFriday home game. In 1999, the Seattle Mariners hosted the Kansas City Royals\nfor a game where both teams wore \"futuristic\" uniforms meant to represent the\nyear 2027 (what will be the Mariners 50th season). The \"Turn Ahead T\nDoc 2(Title: # Third jersey) \nA third jersey, alternate jersey, third kit, third sweater or alternate\nuniform is a jersey or uniform that a sports team wear in games instead of its\nhome outfit or its away outfit, often when the colors of two competing teams'\nother uniforms are too similar to play easily. Alternate jerseys are also a\nmeans for professional sports organizations to generate revenue, by sales to\nfans. Of North American sports leagues, the NFL generates $1.2 billion\nannually in jersey sales, with the NBA second selling $900 million annually.\nAnother use of the alternate uniform is for identifying with causes, like the\nCentral Coast Mariners wear an alternate pink kit on pink ribbon day. Extra\nalternate uniforms or fourth/fifth kits are not commonly used, but are\nsometimes required when teams' other uniforms cause color clashes, or the\nuniforms are unavailable to use. In cases where teams have worn more than\nthree kits in the same season, the extra kits were usually recycled from\nprevious seasons. Third-choice jerseys or uniforms are used in all four Major\nprofessional sports leagues in the United States sports leagues. Third kits\nare commonplace in professional European association football and in some\nprofessional European rugby union clubs. Alternate jerseys are common in\nAustralia's two biggest domestic leagues, the Australian Football League\n(Aussie rules) and National Rugby League (rugby league).\n\n## Background\n\nFor home and away jerseys in North America, historical convention has often\ndictated the colors used by teams in a given league. Teams generally have one\njersey which is primarily in a team color, and another jersey which is\nprimarily white (or another light color) and accented with a team color.\n\"White at home\" is the convention in baseball (MLB), basketball (NBA, NCAA\nbasketball, and WNBA), minor league professional hockey (AHL and ECHL), and\ncollege hockey. \"White while away\" is the convention in football (NFL, CFL,\nNCAA football), major league professional hockey (NHL), and professional\nlacrosse (NLL and MLL). Association football (MLS) does not have a \"white at\nhome\" or a \"white while away\" convention. The NHL (and formerly the NBA)\nenforces the color/white rule strictly; any NHL team seeking to wear white at\nhome must get express permission from the league office to do so. In minor\nleague hockey, the rules are set in both the AHL and ECHL where the team wears\nwhite jerseys at home during one half of the season, then wears the color\njerseys during the other half at home, and vice versa on the road. In the NFL,\nthe rules state that the home team has the first choice of color, with the\nvisiting team forced to choose a contrasting color; an exception was Color\nRush, in which uniform choices were coordinated by the league itself. Starting\nwith their uniform contract with Nike that begins with the 2017-2018 season,\nthe NBA has abolished the color/white rule. Instead, each team will designate\nwhether their white uniform, now dubbed the \"Association Edition,\" or their\ncolored uniform, called the \"Icon Edition,\" will be the home uniform, with the\nother becoming their designated away uniform. In American sports, throwback\njerseys are generally only used for special team games and not for the \"third\"\npurpose. In American football a third jersey may be a throwback uniform based\non designs the team used in the past. In association football, meanwhile, it\nis more commonly a radically different design.\n\n## American football\n\n### National Football League\n\nThe NFL was the last of the major professional sports leagues to adopt the\nthird jersey rule in 2002, with the only exceptions being the 1994 season,\nwhen teams issued a throwback uniform in honour of the league's 75th\nAnniversary. Initially, the NFL rule stated that a team may wear their third\njersey only once a year, however, after one year this restriction was\nincreased to twice a year. Some teams have exceeded the limit; the 2017\nBaltimore Ravens were an example, wearing\nDoc 3(Title: it being that the players claimed to have) trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a\ncompetitive game in the kit. In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \"Manchester\nUnited\", a reversible white/gold away kit was released, although the actual\nmatch day shirts were not reversible. The club's third kit is often all-blue,\nthis was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season. Exceptions include\na green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white\nstriped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97,\nan all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white\nshirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and\n2005–06.

The numbering plan area (NPA) initially contained the southern third\nof the state from the Central Coast to the Mexican border. The area was\nextended to the north in 1950, requiring the southern portion of the Central\nValley, including Bakersfield, to change from area code 415.\n\n### 1951–1984: Major growth\n\nAs a result of southern California's rapid expansion of telephone service\nduring the second half of the 20th century, NPA 213 has been split on numerous\noccasions. The first split became necessary in 1951, when most of the southern\nand eastern portion, including Orange County and San Diego, was assigned area\ncode 714. In 1957, 213 was restricted to Los Angeles County, with most of the\nold 213's northern and western portion becoming area code 805. In 1984, the\nSan Fernando Valley and the San Gabriel Valley became area code 818, thus\nmaking Los Angeles one of the first major cities in the US to be split into\ntwo numbering plan areas—New York City was split for area codes 212 and 718\nthe same year. In 1991, West Los Angeles and the South Bay were assigned area\ncode 310.\n\n### 1998–2017: Separate areas\n\nArea code 323 was created in 1998 as yet another split of 213. When 213 was\ndivided, it kept Los Angeles exchanges 1 (Downtown/Echo Park), 7 (South\nPark/Exposition Park) and 10 (Westlake/Koreatown), while exchanges 2\n(Silverlake/Los Feliz), 3 (Eagle Rock/Highland Park), 4 (El Sereno/Lincoln\nHeights), 5 (Boyle Heights/East Los Angeles), 6 (Watts/Vernon/South Gate), 8\n(South Los Angeles), 9 (Hyde Park/Athens), 11 (West Adams/Jefferson Park), 12\n(Leimert Park/Baldwin Hills), 13 (Hancock Park/Fairfax District) and 14\n(Hollywood/Hollywood Hills) went to 323. This split made 213 one of the\nsmallest area codes in the nation, covering only Downtown Los Angeles and its\nimmediately adjoining neighborhoods, such as Chinatown. Completely surrounding\n213, 323 included most of the remainder of central Los Angeles, including\nHollywood, as well as several neighboring cities, including Bell, Huntington\nPark and Montebello.\n\n### Since 2017: Overlay codes\n\nDespite Southern California's continued growth and the proliferation of cell\nphones and pagers, 213 was not projected to exhaust until 2050. In contrast,\n323 was projected to exhaust in 2017. Since 213 still had an abundance of\nnumbers available, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a plan\nthat erased the boundaries between both area codes, converting the area to an\noverlay plan for all of central Los Angeles. Since this change went into full\neffect on July 8, 2017, telephone companies have been able to assign any\navailable 213 numbers in the former 323 area and vice versa, and customers\nwith 213 or 323 phone numbers have been required to dial the area code for all\ncalls within the area. This change returned 213 to some areas that had used it\nfor more than half a century prior to 1998.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nAn American hip-hop supergroup from Long Beach, California consisting of Snoop\nDogg, Warren G, and Nate Dogg was called 213, based on the area code. Area\ncode 213 is referenced in Warren G and Nate Dogg's song \"Regulate\", Dr. Dre's\n\"Still D.R.E.\", the Electric Six song \"I'm the Bomb\", LL Cool J's song \"Going\nBack to Cali\", Whitney Houston's song \"It's Not Right but It's Okay\",\nTransplants song \"Diamonds and Guns\", and Eminem's \"Shake T\nDoc 3(Title: # Area codes 818 and 747) \nArea codes 818 and 747 are California area codes that primarily cover the San\nFernando Valley of Los Angeles, California. Area code 818 was created in a\nsplit from area code 213 on January 7, 1984. On June 14, 1997, area code 818\nwas split to form area code 626 for most of the San Gabriel Valley. On May 18,\n2009, area code 747 went into service as an overlay.\n\n## History\n\nAfter the standardization of American telephone area codes in 1947, almost all\nof Los Angeles County used the 213 area code. Because the population and phone\nusage of the Los Angeles metropolitan area greatly increased during the 1980s\nand 1990s, the 213 area code was split into several new area codes, including\nthe 818 and 310 area codes. The 818 area code entered service on January 7,\n1984. Area code 626 was split from it on June 14, 1997. In November 1999, it\nwas proposed that \"at some future date\", a new 747 area code would split from\n818, the new 747 serving the southern and western portions of the San Fernando\nValley. This proposal sat dormant until 2007, when the telephone industry and\nthe California Public Utilities Commission began studying implementing this\n818/747 split, or possibly an overlay of all of 818 with 747. Public hearings\nwere held, and the overall public sentiment was for an overlay rather than the\nsplit, since they could retain the 818 area code for their existing telephone\nnumbers. The new 747 area code would be used for numbers associated with new\nservice. On April 24, 2008, the CPUC decided that area code 747 would overlay\narea code 818 effective May 18, 2009. From that date, new numbers could be\nassigned to the new area code. Callers within the 818 and 747 area codes would\nbe required to dial the area code (including calls to the same area code; cell\nphones could dial with or without the \"1\" prefix) for all calls. There was a\ngrace period starting October 11, 2008 during which callers could still\ncomplete calls using the seven-digit number. Since mid-April 2009, calls must\nbe dialed with the area code and number; otherwise, a recorded message to\nremind them will result (cell phone users can omit the \"1\"). The first\ntelephone number block to be assigned to area code 747 became effective on\nOctober 11, 2009.\n\n## Cities in the 747/818 area code\n\n### Neighborhoods/districts in Los Angeles City\n\n  * Arleta\n  * Canoga Park\n  * Chatsworth\n  * Encino\n  * Granada Hills\n  * Lake View Terrace\n  * Lake Balboa\n  * Mission Hills\n  * North Hills\n  * North Hollywood\n  * Northridge\n  * Pacoima\n  * Panorama City\n  * Porter Ranch\n  * Reseda\n  * Shadow Hills\n  * Sherman Oaks\n  * Studio City\n  * Sunland\n  * Sun Valley\n  * Sylmar\n  * Tarzana\n  * Toluca Lake\n  * Tujunga\n  * Valley Village\n  * Van Nuys\n  * West Hills\n  * Winnetka\n  * Woodland Hills\n\n### Los Angeles County\n\n    * Agoura Hills\n    * Burbank\n    * Calabasas\n    * Glendale\n    * Hidden Hills\n    * La Cañada Flintridge\n    * La Crescenta-Montrose\n    * Malibu Lake\n    * Monte Nido\n    * San Fernando\n    * Topanga (mostly in the 310 area code)\n    * Universal City\n    * Westlake Village\n\n### Ventura County\n\n      * Bell Canyon\n      * North Ranch (part of Thousand Oaks/Westlake Village)\n      * Oak Park\n\n## 747 area code conflict with 747 SIP addresses\n\nThe 747 area code conflicted with 10-digit Session Initiation Protocol\naddresses on some VoIP networks such as Gizmo5 (in the format 747NXXXXXX).\nBecause of this conflict, some outgoing calls from VoIP networks using a\n10-digit SIP address could have been mistaken for calls originating from the\nactual 747 area code. These addresses are no longer in use as Gizmo5 service\nwas discontinued as of April 3, 2011.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nIn the movie Pulp Fiction, after Vincent accidentally shoots their associate\nin the face, Jules calls his friend Jimmy in order to find a place to hide\ntheir blood-soaked automobile, telling Vincent he hopes Jimmy is home \"because\nI ain't got no other partners in 818\". In the movie Go, Ronna t\nDoc 4(Title: if applicable) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region;) afterward, the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order. Because\nZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery, there are unusual cases\nwhere a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries, such as a military facility\nspanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced\nfrom a bordering state. For example, ZIP Code 42223 serves Fort Campbell,\nwhich spans Christian County, Kentucky, and Montgomery County, Tennessee, and\nZIP Code 97635 includes portions of Lake County, Oregon, and Modoc County,\nCalifornia. In general, the first three digits designate a sectional center\nfacility, the mail sorting and distribution center for an area. A sectional\ncenter facility may have more than one three-digit code assigned to it. For\nexample, the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in Merrifield is\nassigned codes 220, 221, 222, and 223. In some cases, a sectional center\nfacility may serve an area in an adjacent state, usually due to the lack of a\nproper location for a center in that region. For example, 739 in Oklahoma is\nassigned to Liberal, Kansas; 865 in Arizona is assigned to Gallup, New Mexico;\nand 961 in California to Reno, Nevada. In terms of geographic location, many\nof the lowest ZIP Codes, which begin with '0', are in the New England region.\nAlso in the '0' region are New Jersey (non-contiguous with the remainder of\nthe '0' area), Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and APO/FPO military\naddresses for personnel stationed in Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia, and\naboard vessels based in the waters adjoining those lands. The lowest ZIP Code\nis in Holtsville, New York (00501, a ZIP Code exclusively for the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Service center there). Other low ZIP Codes are 00601 for\nAdjuntas, Puerto Rico; 01001 for Agawam, Massachusetts, and the zip codes\n01002 and 01003 for Amherst, Massachusetts; 01002 is used for mail in town,\nwhile 01003 is reserved for the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Until\n2001, there were six ZIP Codes lower than 00501 that were numbered from 00210\nto 00215 (located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire) and were used by the Diversity\nImmigrant Visa program to receive applications from non-U.S. citizens. The\nnumbers increase southward along the East Coast, such as 02115 (Boston), 10001\n(New York City), 19103 (Philadelphia), 21201 (Baltimore), 20008 (Washington,\nD.C.), 30303 (Atlanta), and 33130 (Miami) (these are only examples, as each of\nthese cities contain several ZIP Codes in the same range). From there, the\nnumbers increase heading westward and northward east of the Mississippi River,\nsouthward west of the Mississippi River, and northward on the West Coast. For\nexample, 40202 is in Louisville, 50309 in Des Moines, 60601 in Chicago, 63101\nin St. Louis, 77036 in Houston, 80202 in Denver, 94111 in San Francisco, 98101\nin Seattle, and 99950 in Ketchikan, Alaska (the highest ZIP Code). The first\ndigit of the ZIP Code is allocated as follows:\n\n  * 0 = Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts (MA), Maine (ME), New Hampshire (NH), New Jersey (NJ), New York (NY, Fishers Island only), Puerto Rico (PR), Rhode Island (RI), Vermont (VT), Virgin Islands (VI), Army Post Office Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East (APO AE); Fleet Post Office Europe and the Middle East (FPO AE)\n  * 1 = Delaware (DE), New York (NY), Pennsylvania (PA)\n  * 2 = District of Columbia (DC), Maryland (MD), North Carolina (NC), South Carolina (SC), Virginia (VA), West Virginia (WV)\n  * 3 = Alabama (AL), Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), Mississippi (MS), Tennessee (TN), Army Post Office Americas (APO AA), Fleet Post Office Americas (FPO AA)\n  * 4 = Indiana (IN), Kentucky (KY), Michigan (MI), Ohio (OH)\n  * 5 = Iowa (IA), Minnesota (MN), Montana (MT), North Dakota (ND), South Dakota (SD), Wisconsin (WI)\n  * 6 = Illinois (IL), Kansas (KS), Missouri (MO), Nebraska (NE)\n  * 7 = Arkansas (AR), Louisiana (LA), Oklahoma (OK), Texas (TX)\n  * 8 = Arizona (AZ), Colorado (CO)\nDoc 5(Title: # Area code 360) \nArea code 360 is the telephone area code for western Washington state outside\nmetropolitan Seattle. It began service on January 15, 1995. The numbering plan\narea (NPA), which encompasses all of western Washington outside urban King,\nPierce, and Snohomish counties and Bainbridge Island, was previously part of\narea code 206. Area codes 360 and 334 (Alabama), which began service on the\nsame day, were the first two area codes in the North American Numbering Plan\nwith a middle digit other than 0 or 1. The served area consists of two\nsections. The larger, western portion stretches from the Strait of Juan de\nFuca to the Oregon border, while the portion on the east shore of Puget Sound\nstretches from the border with British Columbia, Canada almost to Everett.\nThis configuration came when residents of several Seattle exurbs protested\nbeing moved into 360. In response, US West put some of them back in 206.\nHowever, 206 was on the brink of exhaustion even after the creation of 360,\nand the restoration of these exurbs forced the Washington Public Utilities\nCommission to switch most of Seattle's suburban ring into areas 253 and 425 in\n1998, sooner than originally planned. This made 360 one of the few areas in\nNANPA without a continuous land border; others include 706 in Georgia, 423 in\nTennessee and 386 in Florida. Each case results from a split that removed the\nmiddle from a formerly contiguous area. Cities and towns in area code 360\ninclude:\n\n  * Battle Ground\n  * Aberdeen\n  * Anacortes\n  * Arlington\n  * Bellingham\n  * Bremerton\n  * Burlington\n  * Camas\n  * Centralia\n  * Chehalis\n  * Enumclaw\n  * Ferndale\n  * Forks\n  * Kelso\n  * Longview\n  * Marysville\n  * Mount Vernon\n  * Oak Harbor\n  * Olympia\n  * Point Roberts\n  * Port Angeles\n  * Port Orchard\n  * Port Townsend\n  * Poulsbo\n  * Raymond\n  * Sequim\n  * Shelton\n  * Silverdale\n  * Snohomish\n  * South Bend\n  * Stanwood\n  * Vancouver\n  * Washougal\n  * Whidbey Island\n  * Woodland\n  * Yelm\n\nIn 1999, numbering plan area 360 was to be overlaid with area code 564, but\nthe implementation was delayed indefinitely by order of the Washington\nUtilities and Transportation Commission. A 2016 report forecasted exhaustion\nin 2018. The change was approved in May 2016, with implementation of the new\narea code scheduled for 2017. As of September 2017, all calls within the 360\nArea Code require 10-digit dialing, with the first 564 prefix to be assigned\nin the summer of 2018.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Washington area codes\n  * List of NANP area codes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * NANPA Washington area code map\n  * List of exchanges from AreaCodeDownload.com, 360 Area Code\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, area code 978 is associated with northeastern Massachusetts.

A sequel was\nreleased on February 6, 2009.\n\n## Plot\n\nChief Inspector Charles Dreyfus recounts a soccer match between France and\nChina: French coach Yves Gluant arrives wearing the priceless Pink Panther\ndiamond ring, and embraces his girlfriend, pop star Xania. After France wins\nthe game in sudden death, Gluant is killed by a poison dart, with the Pink\nPanther diamond nowhere to be found. Eager to win the Légion d'honneur,\nDreyfus promotes clumsy small-town policeman and \"village idiot\", Inspector\nClouseau, to the rank of Inspector and assigns him to the Pink Panther case.\nDreyfus assembles a secret team of top investigators to actually crack the\ncase, allowing Clouseau to draw media attention as the public face of the\ninvestigation. Dreyfus assigns Gendarme Gilbert Ponton as Clouseau's assistant\nto keep Dreyfus informed of Clouseau's actions. Ponton befriends Clouseau, who\nfalls in love with secretary Nicole Durant. Bizu, a French player who blamed\nGluant for “stealing away” Xania, is the prime murder suspect, but is shot in\nthe head in the team's changing room. Gathering information at a casino,\nClouseau encounters British Agent 006, Nigel Boswell, who foils a robbery by\nthe \"Gas Mask Bandits\", using Clouseau's trench coat to hide his identity.\nClouseau mistakenly receives credit for the deed and is nominated for the\nLégion d'honneur, much to Dreyfus's dismay. Following Xania to New York City,\nPonton insists she is a suspect because Gluant cheated on her, but Clouseau\ndecides Xania is innocent. In New York, Clouseau discovers his love for\nhamburgers. Glaunt’s poison is determined to have been derived from Chinese\nherbs, leading Dreyfus to conclude that the killer is a Chinese envoy, Dr.\nPang. Dreyfus has an officer swap Clouseau's bag with one full of weapons at\nthe airport, setting off the metal detector, and Clouseau is mistakenly\narrested because of his inability to pronounce 'hamburger' correctly.\nReturning to France, he is vilified by the press, and Dreyfus strips him of\nhis rank of Inspector. Dreyfus plots to publicly arrest Dr. Pang at the\nPresidential Ball, where Xania will perform. Clouseau returns home and sees an\narticle about his arrest online; deducing from a photograph of the arrest that\nGluant and Bizu were killed by the same person and the killer will target\nXania next, Clouseau, Ponton, and Nicole hurry to the Élysée Palace and sneak\ninto the Presidential Ball. While Dreyfus arrests Dr. Pang for Gluant's\nmurder, Clouseau and Ponton save Xania's life by capturing her would-be\nassassin Yuri, the team trainer. Jealous of Gluant and feeling overlooked for\nthe team's success, Yuri used his knowledge of Chinese herbs, mandated by a\nsoccer statute, to kill him; Yuri had jabbed the poison dart unseen into\nGluant's neck. Yuri killed Bizu for blackmailing him after overhearing Yuri's\nrants against Glaunt, using Russian military tactics to target Bizu’s\noccipital lobe. Yuri targeted Xania for ignoring him and dating Gluant.\nClouseau reveals that the Pink Panther was not stolen, but sewn into the\nlining of Xania's purse, which had belonged to Josephine Baker and which Xania\nwas restoring; the photograph of Clouseau’s arrest also showed an X-ray of the\npurse at airport security. Xania confesses that she received the diamond from\nGluant as an engagement ring, which she worried could implicate her in his\nDoc 2(Title:  coverage of the) Finals as well as to watch Allen Iverson, whom he named as one of his\nfavourite players.\n\n### Appearance in film\n\nHenry makes a short cameo appearance in the 2015 film Entourage.

    "agent_answer": "<answer> The La Plata River basin of South America is also known as the Río de la Plata basin. This basin is sometimes called the Platine basin or Platine region, and it includes areas of southeastern Bolivia, southern and central Brazil, the entire country of Paraguay, most of Uruguay, and northern Argentina. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo answer this question, I need to recall information about the La Plata River Basin in South America. This basin is a major river system, so it might have other names or designations.\n</think>\n\n<search>Laguna del Plata river basin alternative name</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: # Río de la Plata Basin) \nThe Río de la Plata basin (, ), more often called the River Plate basin in\nscholarly writings, sometimes called the Platine basin or Platine region, is\nthe hydrographical area in South America that drains to the Río de la Plata.\nIt includes areas of southeastern Bolivia, southern and central Brazil, the\nentire country of Paraguay, most of Uruguay, and northern Argentina. Making up\nabout one fourth of the continent's surface, it is the second largest drainage\nbasin in South America (after the Amazon basin) and one of the largest in the\nworld. The main rivers of the La Plata basin are the Paraná River, the\nParaguay River (the Paraná's main tributary), and the Uruguay River.\n\n## Geography\n\nThe La Plata basin is bounded by the Brazilian Highlands to the north, the\nAndes Mountains to the west, and Patagonia to the south. The watershed extends\nmostly northward from the source of the Río de la Plata for roughly , as far\nas Brasília and Cuiabá in Brazil and Sucre in Bolivia, spanning latitudes\nbetween 14 and 37 degrees south and longitudes between 43 and 67 degrees west.\nThe Paraná River, La Plata's largest tributary, is South America's second\nlongest river and one of the longest in the world.. Politically the basin\nincludes part or all of the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso, Goiás, Minas\nGerais, São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande\ndo Sul, the Bolivian departments of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija, the\nentire country of Paraguay, the western and central departments of Uruguay,\nand the Argentine provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Formosa, Chaco, Misiones,\nTucumán, Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, Corrientes, Córdoba, Entre Ríos,\nBuenos Aires and La Pampa.\n\n## Hydrology\n\nThe precipitation falling within this area is collected by numerous rivers to\nfinally reach the Río de la Plata, almost all of it through the Paraná River,\nthe Paraguay River, and the Uruguay River, La Plata's most important\ntributaries. The river discharges water into the Atlantic Ocean at an average\nrate of , the majority of which comes from the Paraná. The basin serves as the\nrecharge zone for the Guarani Aquifer, one of the world's largest aquifer\nsystems. The rivers of the La Plata Basin carry an estimated of silt into the\nRío de la Plata each year, where the muddy waters are stirred up by winds and\ntides; the shipping route from the Atlantic to Buenos Aires is kept open by\ncontinual dredging.\n\n### Tributaries\n\nThe Paraná River's main tributaries include the Paranaíba River, Grande River,\nTietê River, Paranapanema River, Iguazu River, Paraguay River, and the Salado\nRiver, after which it ends in the large Paraná Delta. The Paraguay River flows\nthrough the Pantanal wetland, after which its main tributaries include the\nPilcomayo River and the Bermejo River, before it ends in the Paraná. The\nUruguay's main tributaries include the Pelotas River, Canoas River, Ibicuí\nRiver, and the Río Negro. Another significant tributary to the Río de la Plata\nis the Salado del Sur River.\n\n## History\n\nThe Río de la Plata Basin has been the site of much conflict in the modern\nhistory of South America, much of it because the basin contained the\n(contested) frontiers between the Portuguese and Spanish Empires in South\nAmerica and their successor states. A series of wars has been fought over\nterritorial control in the region, particularly in the nineteenth century.\n\n### Early exploration\n\nExplorer Sebastian Cabot made a detailed study of the Río de la Plata and its\ntributaries and gave the river its modern name. He explored the Paraná and\nUruguay rivers between 1526 and 1529, ascending the Paraná as far as the\npresent-day city of Asunción, and also explored up the Paraguay River. Cabot\nacquired silver trinkets trading with the Guaraní near today's Asunción, and\nthese objects gave rise to the name Río de la Plata, \"river of silver\".\n\n### Colonial period\n\nThe first European colony in the Platine region was the city of Buenos Aires,\nfounded by\nDoc 2(Title: so explored up the Paraguay River. Cabot) acquired silver trinkets trading with the Guaraní near today's Asunción, and\nthese objects gave rise to the name Río de la Plata, \"river of silver\".\n\n### Colonial period\n\nThe first European colony in the Platine region was the city of Buenos Aires,\nfounded by Pedro de Mendoza on 2 February 1536. This settlement, however, was\nquickly abandoned; the failure to establish a settlement on the La Plata\nestuary led to explorations upriver and the founding of Asunción in 1537.\nBuenos Aires was subsequently refounded by Juan de Garay on 11 June 1580.\nDuring the colonial era the Platine basin was largely neglected by the Spanish\nEmpire until the 1760s, when Portugal and Britain threatened to expand into\nthe estuary. The Spanish colonies in the region were separated from the\nViceroyalty of Perú and formed into a new Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata\nin 1776. During the Napoleonic Wars Spain became an ally of the French, and\nBritain invaded the region in 1806–1807 unsuccessfully.\n\n### Revolutionary period\n\nConflict in the region intensified after the independence of the former\nSpanish and Portuguese colonies in the first quarter of the nineteenth\ncentury. Territorial interests and navigation rights in the Platine region\nwere at issue in many armed conflicts throughout the century, including the\nArgentine Civil Wars, the Cisplatine and Platine wars, and the Paraguayan War.\n\n## Economic features\n\n### Dams\n\nThere are several hydroelectric dams operating in the basin, among them the\nsecond largest operating facility in the world, Itaipu, shared between\nParaguay and Brazil on the Paraná River; the 21st, Ilha Solteira Dam in\nBrazil, on the Paraná; the 25th, the Yacyretá Dam shared between Paraguay and\nArgentina, also on the Paraná; and the 53rd, the Itumbiara Dam, in Brazil, on\nthe Paranaíba River. Also on the Paranaíba, in Brazil, are the Emborcação and\nSão Simão dams. On the Paraná, in Brazil, also are the Engineer Souza Dias and\nthe Engineer Sérgio Motta dams. On the Grande River, in Brazil, are the Água\nVermelha, Furnas, Peixotos, Marimbondo, Luiz Barreto, Jaguara and Volta Grande\ndams. On the Iguazu river, in Brazil, are the Bento Munhoz, Ney Braga, José\nRicha, Salto Santiago and Salto Osório hydroelectric power plants. On the\nPelotas river, in Brazil, it is the Machadinho Hydroelectric Power Plant. The\nSalto Grande Dam is on the Uruguay River and it is shared between Uruguay and\nArgentina. Also on the Uruguay River, but in Brazil territory, is the Itá\nHydroelectric Power Plant. On the Negro River, in Uruguay, there are the\nRincon del Bonete or Gabriel Terra Reservoir (not an hydroelectric facility),\nand the Baygorria and Constitucion dams.\n\n## Regional culture\n\nThe dialect of Spanish spoken in the lower Río de la Plata basin is\nRioplatense Spanish, named for the river. The Platine region is the birthplace\nof the tango dance and music.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Association of American States: La Plata Basin\n  * Map\n  * Cuenca del Plata at Monografías.com\nDoc 3(Title: erica) \n  * Laguna del Carbón, in Gran Bajo de San Julián, Argentina – the lowest point in the Western and Southern hemispheres\n  * Lake Mar Chiquita in Argentina.\n  * The Altiplano includes a number of closed basins such as the Salar de Coipasa, and Titicaca–Poopó system.\n  * Lake Valencia, in Venezuela.\n  * Salar de Atacama, in the Atacama Desert, Chile.\n\n## Ancient\n\nSome of the Earth's ancient endorheic systems and lakes include:\n\n  * The Black Sea, until its merger with the Mediterranean.\n  * The Mediterranean Sea itself and all its tributary basins, during its Messinian desiccation (approximately five million years ago) as it became disconnected from the Atlantic Ocean.\n  * The Orcadian Basin in Scotland during the Devonian period.

The BCPA merely allows the\ngovernment to \"construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works in\nthe main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon\". When\nSecretary Wilbur spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway\nbetween Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam\n\"Hoover Dam\", citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none\nhad been so honored during their terms of office. Wilbur justified his choice\non the ground that Hoover was \"the great engineer whose vision and persistence\n... has done so much to make [the dam] possible\". One writer complained in\nresponse that \"the Great Engineer had quickly drained, ditched, and dammed the\ncountry.\" After Hoover's election defeat in 1932 and the accession of the\nRoosevelt administration, Secretary Ickes ordered on May 13, 1933, that the\ndam be referred to as \"Boulder Dam\". Ickes stated that Wilbur had been\nimprudent in naming the dam after a sitting president, that Congress had never\nratified his choice, and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam.\nUnknown to the general public, Attorney General Homer Cummings informed Ickes\nthat Congress had indeed used the name \"Hoover Dam\" in five different bills\nappropriating money for construction of the dam. The official status this\nconferred to the name \"Hoover Dam\" had been noted on the floor of the House of\nRepresentatives by Congressman Edward T. Taylor of Colorado on December 12,\n1930, but was likewise ignored by Ickes. When Ickes spoke at the dedication\nceremony on September 30, 1935, he was determined, as he recorded in his\ndiary, \"to try to nail down for good and all the name Boulder Dam.\" At one\npoint in the speech, he spoke the words \"Boulder Dam\" five times within thirty\nseconds. Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one\nperson, it should be for California Senator Hiram Johnson, a lead sponsor of\nthe authorizing legislation. Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder\nDam, and the Republican-leaning Los Angeles Times, which at the time of Ickes'\nname change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes ineffectively chipping\naway at an enormous sign \"HOOVER DAM,\" reran it showing Roosevelt reinforcing\nIckes, but having no greater success. In the following years, the name\n\"Boulder Dam\" failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using both names\ninterchangeably and mapmakers divided as to which name should be printed.\nMemories of the Great Depression faded, and Hoover to some extent\nrehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In\n1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name\n\"Hoover Dam.\" Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change,\nstating, \"I didn't know Hoover was that small a man to take credit for\nsomething he had nothing to do with.\"\n\n## Recognition\n\nHoover Dam was recognized as a National Civil Engineering Landmark in 1984.

Created as a spin-off of The\nVampire Diaries, the series follows vampire-werewolf hybrid Klaus Mikaelson as\nhe and his family become embroiled in the supernatural politics of the French\nQuarter of New Orleans. On May 10, 2017, The CW renewed the series for a fifth\nseason. On July 20, 2017, it was announced by series creator Julie Plec ahead\nof Comic Con that the series' fifth season would be its last. The final season\nbegan airing on April 18, 2018, and finished on August 1, 2018.\n\n## Series overview\n\nThe Originals, a spin-off from The Vampire Diaries, centers on three of the\nMikaelson siblings: Klaus (Joseph Morgan), Elijah (Daniel Gillies), and\nRebekah (Claire Holt). The Mikaelson family are also commonly known as \"the\nOriginals\" due to the fact that they are the first vampires in history.\nNiklaus \"Klaus\" Mikaelson is a descendant of a witch and a werewolf, and his\nquest to unleash his hybrid nature was detailed in The Vampire Diaries. The\nbackdoor pilot, which aired on April 25, 2013, also revealed that the werewolf\nHayley (Phoebe Tonkin) is pregnant with Klaus's child. The series begins with\nthe Original siblings returning to the city of New Orleans for the first time\nsince 1919, where a pregnant Hayley has also settled. Having originally built\nthe French Quarter, they had been forced to abandon it when fleeing from their\nvengeful father. In their absence, Klaus's protégé, Marcel (Charles Michael\nDavis), took charge of the French Quarter. Klaus resolves that they must take\ndown Marcel and get back the city that once belonged to them. While doing that\nthey must also protect their city from a war brewing between vampires,\nwerewolves, and witches. Over time, new and old friendships are formed, love\nis in the air, death surrounds them, and the Originals learn more about their\nown family past. The first season describes how Klaus's mystical child is\ngoing to be born and speaks of the threats that the Originals together must\nkeep her safe from. The second season deals with the return of Klaus and his\nsiblings' parents, and the arrival of an aunt who threatens the baby's life.\nThe third season shows the Mikaelsons facing both a prophecy that speaks of\ntheir downfall, and the first non-Original vampires in who have wanted revenge\nagainst the Mikaelsons for nearly a millennium. The fourth season jumps ahead\nfive years, with the Mikaelsons returning to New Orleans and having to face a\nreawakened ancient mystical menace set on destroying anything in its path. The\nfifth and final season of the series takes place seven years after the fourth\nseason, with Hope now being a teenager at a school for supernatural children,\nthe Salvatore Boarding School for the Young and Gifted and the Mikaelsons\nstill having to face the ancient menace from the previous season while trying\nto re-unite their family once again.\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n  * Joseph Morgan as Niklaus \"Klaus\" Mikaelson: The self-proclaimed King of the French Quarter of New Orleans and the Original Hybrid: half-Original Vampire and half-werewolf. As the son of a witch and a werewolf alongside being a vampire by magic, Klaus is one of the most powerful and feared supernatural beings in history but also has a soft spot for his family. He is the father of Hayley's daughter, Hope, and is the adoptive father of Marcel, also his former protégé. He eventually develops feelings for Cami.\n  * Daniel Gillies as Elijah Mikaelson: An Original Vampire and Klaus's older maternal half-brother. He is shown to be extremely suave, always sporting a suit, and level-headed compared to Klaus's more heated tendencies. He is also known as the \"Noble Brother\". He harbors romantic affections for Hayley.\n  * Claire Holt as Rebekah Mikaelson (main season 1; special guest star season 2–5): An Original Vampire and Klaus's younger maternal half-sister. She is Kla\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, \"The Originals\" Season 5 Episode 10 was released on April 18, 2018.

While the opening sequence shows scenes from Norwood and\nOuray, Colorado and surrounding Ouray and San Miguel Counties, The Ranch is\nfilmed on a sound stage in front of a live audience in Burbank, California.\nEach season consists of 20 episodes broken up into two parts, each containing\n10 episodes, the episodes are approximately 30 minutes in length. All episodes\nare named after American country music songs, predominantly Kenny Chesney in\npart one, George Strait in part two, Tim McGraw in part three, Garth Brooks in\npart four, Dolly Parton in part five, Alabama in part six, and Brad Paisley in\npart seven. On October 31, 2018, Netflix renewed the series for a fourth and\nfinal season with the series to conclude in 2020. The first part of the final\nseason (Part 7) premiered on September 13, 2019. The second part of the final\nseason (part 8) is set to be released on January 24, 2020.\n\n## Premise\n\nThe show takes place on the fictional Iron River Ranch in the fictitious small\ntown of Garrison, Colorado; detailing the life of the Bennetts, a\ndysfunctional family consisting of two brothers, their rancher father, and his\nestranged wife, a local bar owner.\n\n## Cast\n\n### Main\n\n  * Ashton Kutcher as Colt Reagan Bennett, a former high school and college football star who pursued a professional career with mixed success, never finding regular playing time or stardom, but hanging on in backup roles and on practice squads. He returns to his hometown after a fifteen-year absence so that he can take part in a tryout with a semi-pro team, and decides to stay and help his father and older brother on their family ranch. Colt is frequently the butt of their jokes, particularly when it comes to his ranching skills (or lack thereof) and his disappointing pro football career. He is a heavy drinker and has a penchant for not using common sense, but he seems to have a heart of gold and tries to do right by others. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue throughout the first season, it's implied that Colt has played for the Barcelona Dragons, San Jose SaberCats, Spokane Shock, Orlando Predators, Nebraska Danger, Iowa Barnstormers, Green Bay Blizzard, Minnesota Axemen, Portland Forest Dragons and Philadelphia Soul. Dialogue and team gear also indicates that he was a member of teams in Canada, notably the Ottawa Redblacks and fictional Saskatoon Cold (\"Like the Miami Heat... only cold\"). He has also played on teams in Alaska and was a member of the Buffalo Bills practice squad. In the first episode of the series, Colt reveals that he was \"the back up to the back up to the back up\" for the Florida State team that won the college football championship in 1999. He later marries Abby, his high school sweetheart, and they become the parents of a daughter they name Peyton.\n  * Danny Masterson as Jameson \"Rooster\" Ford Bennett (seasons 1–3), Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career, at times showing a bitter attitude for having to accept the responsibility while Colt pursued his dream. Despite living in Colt's shadow he is far more competent on the ranch as well as a more level headed thinker. He has, however, been just as irresponsible as Colt, drinking too much and sleeping around. In the first half of Season 3, Rooster gets into hot water with Mary's intimidating boyfriend, and in the second episode of Part 6, it is discovered that Rooster's motorcycle went off the side of a dangerous road; he is missing and presumed dead.\n  * Debra Winger as Maggie Bennett (seasons 1–3), owner of Maggie's, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns. Much more lighthearted and caring than Beau, her company and advice is often sought out by the boys on\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, the show \"The Ranch\" concluded its run with the eighth and final part of its fourth season, which was set to be released on January 24, 2020. There are no indications of future seasons or new releases for this particular \"Ranch\" show. However, it's important to note that the question might refer to another \"Ranch\" show, such as \"Yellowstone,\" where new seasons continue to be produced.

    "question": "Where do you find red and yellow marrow?",
    "agent_answer": "<answer> Red and yellow marrow are primarily found within the bone marrow cavities of certain bones in the human body. Yellow marrow, composed mainly of fat cells, is typically found in the long bones of the arms and legs, as well as the pelvis and sternum, especially after adolescence when the body has stored enough energy reserves. Red marrow, which is more actively involved in blood cell production, is predominantly located in the flat bones such as the skull, ribs, vertebrae, and hip bones. It is also present in the short bones (like those in the wrist and ankle) and the proximal ends of long bones. As we age, some red marrow may convert to yellow marrow, but the body maintains a reserve of red marrow necessary for hematopoiesis (blood cell formation). </answer>",

It was produced by Fulwell 73 Productions and co-\nproduced by Ben Winston and Mars. It aired on November 29, 2017, on CBS. The\nshow features scenes of Mars and his band, The Hooligans, giving out tickets,\ninteracting with customers in a hair salon, singing and goofing on the streets\nof Harlem, intercut with a performance of most of his third studio album, 24K\nMagic (2016). The TV show began at the Apollo's marquee with a performance of\nthe song \"24K Magic\". The TV special received a positive response from\nreviewers; some praised the energy of the live performances while others\ncomplemented his vocals throughout the entire show. Bruno Mars: 24K Magic Live\nat the Apollo was first released on Blu-ray in Japan on April 11, 2018,\nthrough Warner Music Japan as part of the album's deluxe edition. The program,\nbroadcast twice, attracted approximately 9.76 million viewers. It was\nnominated at the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in the category of\nOutstanding Music Direction and for Outstanding Variety Show - Series or\nSpecial at the 50th NAACP Image Awards.\n\n## Background\n\nIn September 2017, American entertainment magazine Us Weekly revealed there\nwere plans for a TV special by Bruno Mars at the Apollo Theater in New York\nCity. Mars had already \"teased\" tickets to a \"secret New York Show\" and posted\nvideo clips showed him on top of the Apollo's marquee performing the singles\n\"24K Magic\" (2016) and \"That's What I Like\" (2017). It was later confirmed\nthat Mars would be starring in his first TV concert special, titled Bruno\nMars: 24K Magic Live at the Apollo, a one-hour program, which would air on CBS\non November 29, 2017, at 10:00 p.m.–11:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific time. CBS and\nAtlantic Records partnered with Bruno Mars to premiere his first television\nspecial. The program was produced by Fulwell 73 Productions, with Mars and Ben\nWinston serving as executive producers. Chris Howie directed the TV special,\nwhile Carly Shackleton was the supervising producer, Lou Fox served as line\nproducer and Jez Breadin was in charge of floor production. Julie Greenwald\nwas a co-executive producer and Leo-Perman was in charge of the executive\nproduction. David Dieckman and Craig Anderson were the video encoding and menu\ndesign authors for Craigman Digital. Ben Winston said, \"Bruno Mars is the\ngreatest performer in the world, to be producing his first television special\nis a true honor.\" Jack Sussman, Executive Vice President, Specials, Music and\nLive Events at CBS affirmed that Mars is one of the best performers of this\ngeneration and CBS was thrilled to broadcast his TV special. Sussman added,\n\"He burns the roof off the Apollo while paying respect to its tradition and\nhistory.\" On November 20, 2017, Mars shared a trailer for the show where he is\nshown with some of his bandmates, The Hooligans, in a car with a bullhorn\ngreeting the locals, working in a kitchen and performing on top of the Apollo\nTheater's marquee. Mars confessed when he and his band were recording scenes\nwith customers in a hair salon, giving out tickets and performing on the\nstreets of Harlem, they were sometimes told to \"shut up\" by people hanging out\nof their doors. He also said that only at this point in his career did he feel\nprepared to face the \"brutal audience at the Apollo\", as they, previously, had\nshown disapproval at \"Amateur Night at the Apollo\". Mars said that when he and\nhis band filmed the show, they were \"a well-oiled machine\" and that \"people\nare going to get the best that I got\". He chose the Apollo Theater because it\nis a \"magical place\" for him given its \"rich history in music and pop\nculture\". Mars said the best part was that \"the locals in Harlem\" were so\nwelcome.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe show starts with footage of Mars and The Hooligans walking \nDoc 4(Title: :) X Prime, Young the Giant, Milky Chance, Interpol, Weezer Sunday: Ryn Weaver,\nGary Clark Jr, Future Islands, Hot Chip, Alt-J Valley Stage Friday: Strand of\nOaks, Shakey Graves, Bahamas, Twenty One Pilots, G-Eazy, Young Fathers\nSaturday: Leikeli47, Seoul, Pierre Kwenders, Alvvays, Desaparecidos, Ariane\nMoffatt Sunday: Cordelia & The Buffalo, Glass Animals, Sylvan Esso, First Aid\nKit, Broods, Banks Green Stage Friday: John Jacob Magistery, The Franklin\nElectric, Run The Jewels, The Kills, Chet Faker, FKA Twigs, Schoolboy Q\nSaturday: Bernhari, carte blanche to Karim Ouellet, Narcy with Yasiin Bey (aka\nMos Def), Christine and the Queens, Nas, Kygo, Caribou Sunday: SZA, Raury, MS\nMR, Charli XCX, Brand New, Tove Lo, Tyler, The Creator Trees Stage Friday:\nPONI, DMA's, Guster, Milk & Bone, The Thurston Moore Band, Viet Cong,\nSaturday: Leisure Cruise, The OBGMs, Lion Babe, Bishop Nehru, Anamanaguchi,\nNothing Friday: Jessica Hernandez & the Deltas, Coasts, San Fermin, Toro y\nMoi, Philip Selway, Klô Pelgag, EZ3kiel Piknic Electronik Stage Friday: CRi,\nSkylar Spence, Sango, Tommy Kruise, Hermitude, Cashmere Cat, Brodinski, GTA,\nRL Grime, A Tribe Called Red Saturday: Das Mörtal, Peking Duk, Slow Magic,\nKlangkarussell, Daphni, Oliver Heldens, What So Not, Hudson Mohawke, Art\nDepartment, Robin Schulz Sunday: Boundary, Thylacine, Bob Moses, N'TO,\nGoldroom, The Black Madonna, Dusky, Zhu\n\n### 2016\n\nOsheaga 2016 took place July 29 through July 31 at Montreal's Parc Jean-\nDrapeau.

    "question": "How is death penalty carried out in singapore?",
    "agent_answer": "<answer> The death penalty in Singapore is carried out through hanging. This method is typically performed at the Singapore Prison Service's Changi Prison. Executions are conducted by a prison officer who administers a single dose of a lethal injection or by hanging, depending on the specific case and legal procedures. Hanging is the most common method used for crimes such as murder, drug trafficking, and other serious offenses.\n\nThe execution process is closely supervised by the authorities, and family members of the condemned person are usually informed beforehand. In cases involving foreign nationals, their respective embassies are also notified. The execution is carried out by a qualified prison officer, often with assistance from medical personnel to ensure a humane procedure.\n\nIt's important to note that the death penalty in Singapore is a severe form of punishment reserved for very serious crimes.

    "question": "Where does the tree of life come from?",
    "agent_answer": "<answer> The concept of the \"Tree of Life\" originates from various mythologies and religious texts around the world, each with its own unique interpretation and symbolism. In many ancient cultures, the Tree of Life represents the axis mundi, a central pillar connecting the underworld, the earthly realm, and the heavens. This concept appears in numerous religions and mythologies, including Norse, Christian, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian traditions.\n\nIn Christianity, the Tree of Life is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, where it is described as a sacred tree in the Garden of Eden that grants eternal life. Similarly, in Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is the world tree that supports the nine worlds and connects the realms of gods, humans, and other beings. The Tree of Life also features prominently in Islamic tradition, particularly in Sufism, where it symbolizes the path to God and spiritual enlightenment.\n\nThe idea of the Tree of Life can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia, where the Epic of Gilgamesh mentions a sacred tree that provides immortality. In Egyptian mythology, the Tree of Life is associated with the goddess Hathor, who is often depicted as a cow or a woman with cow's horns and a sun disk on her head, symbolizing the connection between the earth and the sky.\n\nWhile the specific origins of the Tree of Life concept vary across different cultures, it generally represents themes such as creation, sustenance, knowledge, and the interconnectedness of all things. These symbolic meanings have been preserved and adapted through literature, art, and cultural traditions over thousands of years.\n\nThe term \"Tree of Life\" has also taken on a more literal meaning in modern contexts, referring to actual trees or forests that provide ecological benefits and support biodiversity. </answer>",

Written by\nLobo under his real name Kent LaVoie, it appears on the Introducing Lobo\nalbum. The single peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first of\nfour of his songs to hit #1 on the Easy Listening chart, where it had a two-\nweek stay at that top spot in May 1971. The song also reached #4 in the UK\nSingles Chart in July 1971, and spent four weeks at #1 in New Zealand.\nInternationally, \"Me and You and a Dog Named Boo\" was Lobo's second most\nsuccessful song among more than 15 single releases. It was surpassed only by\n\"I'd Love You to Want Me\" the following year.\n\n## Chart history\n\n### Weekly charts\n\n### Year-end charts\n\n## Cover versions\n\n  * Later in 1971, country artist Stonewall Jackson recorded the song, which was his final Top 40 hit on the US country chart, peaking at #7.\n  * In 1972, a version was sung by The Brady Kids in the episode \"Who Was That Dog...?\" on their Saturday morning cartoon show.\n\n## See also\n\n  * List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1971 (U.S.)\n  * List of number-one singles in 1971 (New Zealand)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\nDoc 2(Title: ich he responded: \"of course.\" He also gave a nod to President Harry) Truman's quote, \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\" The White\nHouse website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical\ndetails of Bo.\n\n## Biographical details\n\nListed by the name \"Amigo's New Hope\" with American Kennel Club's breed\nregistry and given the name \"Charlie\" by his original owners, the puppy\nreceived his current name from President Obama's two daughters, Malia and\nSasha, in part after their cousins' cat and Michelle Obama's father's nickname\nDiddley; the dog is a namesake of singer Bo Diddley. In June 2009, the White\nHouse released a baseball card for Bo with his new official portrait on one\nside and tongue-in-cheek statistics on the other; information included the\nfacts that Bo's favorite food is tomatoes and that he does not yet know how to\nswim. The card is available by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to\nthe White House. According to financial disclosure forms released by President\nObama in 2010, Bo was purchased for $1,600 (). As of August 2012, Bo was on a\ndiet, though no other details were released (it was announced by the President\nduring the Kids' State Dinner, where children from the states and territories\nwho had won a contest to design healthy, appealing meals had lunch at the\nWhite House).\n\n## Disputed rescue heritage\n\nThe Obamas originally voiced a strong desire to adopt a shelter dog, but made\nno firm commitments. In the summer of 2008, Best Friends Animal Society, an\nanimal welfare organization, gathered 50,000 signatures on a petition asking\nthe family to adopt a shelter animal. As Bo is a gift through a breeder, he is\nnot a shelter dog. Dog expert Cesar Milan stated Bo could be considered part\nof a larger group known as \"rescue dogs\". He was unsuccessful in his first\nhome when plans for him to provide companionship to an older female dog went\nawry; apparently his attempts to suckle irritated her. The Obamas pledged a\ndonation to the DC Humane Society in a show of support for shelter dogs. Some\nanimal welfare supporters criticized The White House for not adopting a\nshelter dog. The Humane Society of the United States released a statement\nthanking the Obamas \"for taking in a second-chance dog,\" but also discouraged\ngoing through breeders.\n\n## Reactions by and in the media\n\nThe Washington Post's Manuel Roig-Franzia, granted exclusive initial access to\nBo for the print media, described the puppy: \"Bo's a handsome little guy. Well\nsuited for formal occasions at the White House, he's got tuxedo-black fur,\nwith a white chest, white paws and a rakish white goatee.\" People for the\nEthical Treatment of Animals (PETA) described the family's choice to accept\nthe gift of a puppy from a family friend as \"disquieting\" and publicly urged\nObama to have Bo neutered, despite the fact that the dog had been neutered\nbefore the Obamas received him. In anticipation of increased interest in the\nbreed, the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America issued a statement requesting\nthat members of the public considering obtaining the dogs \"ensure that this\nbreed fits their lifestyle\", advising that the dogs' needs preclude their\nbeing left alone for long periods or boarded in kennels. Immediately upon Bo\njoining the First Family, four children's books and a plush toy depicting him\nwere slated for publication or manufacture. On July 17, 2009, the author Ben\nGreenman, writing in The New York Times as Bo, reflected on his first hundred\ndays in office. In the final episode of the History Channel's Life After\nPeople, aired March 16, 2010, the producers imagined what life would be like\nfor Bo after the disappearance of humanity. This speculated that he would\nleave the White House, and live off seafood from the Chesapeake Bay. Bo was\nalso shown on Dogs 101, as part of segment about the breed. Bo has appeared in\nthe comic book Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers and on the television shows Late\nNight with Seth Meyers and Ellen.

It was also recorded by Muppet Rowlf the Dog in 1984 and released on\nthis album Ol' Brown Ears is Back in 1993. Lea Michele and Melissa Benoist\nperformed the song during the first episode of season 4 of the TV show Glee.\nIt reached twenty-four on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.\n\n### In movies\n\nIn the 2004 film , Garfield sings a parody of the song entitled, \"New Dog\nState of Mind\" after he is kicked out of the house for one night by his owner\nJon for making a big mess in the house. Instead, he favors Odie more than\nGarfield.\n\n### In books\n\nIn 2004, it was announced that Joel had agreed to write two children's books\nfor Scholastic, the U.S. publisher. The first book was entitled Goodnight, My\nAngel (A Lullabye). The second book was entitled New York State of Mind and is\nillustrated by the artist Izak. The large picture book comes with a CD of the\nsong, the disc is illustrated with a picture of the Empire State Building by\nIzak.\n\n### Sports\n\nThis song is played after every New York Boulders home loss at Palisades\nCredit Union Park and at the conclusion of the live racing day at Saratoga\nRace Course.

No recorded version is known to survive. On August 30, 1972,\nLennon performed the song with the Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band at\nMadison Square Garden, New York City, in one of his last charity concerts, and\nwas released on his Live in New York album on January 24, 1986. John Lennon\nalso recorded \"Hound Dog\" during his huge rehearsal of early Rock and Roll\nclassics (for the Madison Square Garden concert) that was released on the\nunauthorized album S.I.R. John Winston Ono Lennon. Tony Sheridan (who was\nasked to join the young Beatles) also recorded the Presley version of \"Hound\nDog\".\n\n### Foreign language versions\n\nAmong those artists who have recorded non-English versions of \"Hound Dog\" are:\n\n  * Ralf Bendix (in German, as \"Heut Geh' Ich Nicht Nach Hause\") (1957); (Today I'm Not Going Home)\n  * Die Rock and Rollers with the Orchestra (in German, as \"Das Ist Rock And Roll\") (lyrics: Fini Busch) (1957);\n  * Dyno Y Los Solitarios (in Mexican Spanish, as \"Sabueso\") (1960: Discos Audiomex).

In\nJanuary 1957, Jewish American satirist Mickey Katz released a Yinglish novelty\nsong version, \"You're a Doity Dog\" (Capitol F3607), singing with a Yiddish\naccent, and having a klezmer break between verses. In this freilach-rock song,\nKatz sang \"You ain't nothin' but a paskudnick\".

Bo is a male Portuguese Water Dog. President Barack\nObama and his family were given the dog as a gift after months of speculation\nabout the breed and identity of their future pet. The final choice was made in\npart because Malia Obama's allergies dictated a need for a hypoallergenic\nbreed. Bo has occasionally been called \"First Dog\". In August 2013, Bo was\njoined by Sunny, a female dog of the same breed. Bo was named by Malia and\nSasha after their cousins' cat and Michelle Obama's father, in reference to\nthe R&B; musician Bo Diddley, although the name also makes up the initials of\nBarack Obama (B.O.).\n\n## Breed background\n\nThe Portuguese Water Dog is originally from the Algarve region of Portugal.\nOnly 48 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain's Crufts competition in\nthe year 2009 and the author of The New Complete Portuguese Water Dog, Kitty\nBraund, believes there are about 50,000 in North America. Due to its fleecy\ncoat of minimally shedding hair, the Portuguese Water Dog is considered a\nhypoallergenic dog breed.\n\n## Breeding and original owners\n\nBred by Martha and Art Stern of Amigo Portuguese Water Dogs in Boyd, Texas, Bo\nis a son of \"Watson\" —of the Rader family in Pittsburgh's Ambridge suburb—and\n\"Penny\", belonging to Art and Martha Stern. One of Bo's nine litter mates was\nSenator Ted Kennedy's dog named \"Cappy\" (Amigo's Captain Courageous); the\nlitter was named \"Hope and Change\", in honor of Obama's victory. Bo's original\nbuyer is unknown, but eventually they returned him to the Stern family;\npurchasing Bo required signing a contract to return him to his breeder if\nthings did not work out. Bo enrolled with Kennedy's obedience trainer Dawn\nSylvia-Stasiewicz, in Hume, Virginia, on January 5, 2009. Bo's brother, Rico,\nis owned by a couple in Houston, Texas.\n\n## Selection of the dog\n\nAt his first press conference as President-elect, Obama was questioned by\nreporters as to which breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, \"We\nhave two criteria that have to be reconciled. One is that Malia is allergic,\nso it has to be hypoallergenic. There are a number of breeds that are\nhypoallergenic. On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter\ndog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me. So – so whether\nwe're going to be able to balance those two things, I think, is a pressing\nissue on the Obama household.\" George Stephanopoulos asked Obama on television\nin early January what kind of dog they would get, and when, saying that he was\npassing on a question from Obama's daughters who were sitting in the control\nroom. Obama said, \"They seem to have narrowed it down to a labradoodle or a\nPortuguese water hound ... medium-sized dog, and so, we're now going to start\nlooking at shelters to see when one of those dogs might come up.\" Much was\nmade by the public and press about the family's search for a dog. On April 12,\n2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old\nPortuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy. The dog was\nreported to have visited the family some weeks earlier in a secret meeting to\ngauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as \"The Meeting\".\nHowever, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved\nin at the White House on Tuesday, April 14, 2009. Immediately after he\narrived, the family staged a photo op with Bo on the property's South Lawn. At\nthe conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside the Oval Office,\nto which he responded: \"of course.\" He also gave a nod to President Harry\nTruman's quote, \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\" The White\nHouse website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical\ndetails of Bo.\n\n## Biographical details\n\nListed by the name \"Amigo's New Hope\"\n</information>\n\n\n<answer> The song \"Me, You and a Dog Named Boo\" was sung by Lobo, whose real name was Kent LaVoie. This song was released in 1971 and became a hit, reaching the top of the Easy Listening chart and making it to the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. </answer>"

It has Shinichiro Watanabe as\ncreative producer. Shinji Aramaki and Kenji Kamiyama will direct the initial\nseason, which will have 13 episodes at 30 minutes each. It will air dubbed on\nAdult Swim on its Toonami programming block and streamed by Crunchyroll. The\nseries is being produced by Japanese animation studio Sola Digital Arts. The\nseries will take place in the year 2032 and will include \"familiar\" characters\nfrom the Blade Runner universe. The series is set ten years after the anime\nshort Blade Runner Black Out 2022.\n\n## Cast and crew\n\n### Cast\n\nThis table shows the characters and the actors who have portrayed them\nthroughout the franchise. A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in\nthe film, or that the character's presence in the film has not yet been\nannounced.\n\n### Crew\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office performance\n\n### Critical and public response\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nWhile not initially a success with North American audiences, the film was\npopular internationally and garnered a cult following. The film's dark style\nand futuristic designs have served as a benchmark and its influence can be\nseen in many subsequent science fiction films, video games, anime, and\ntelevision programs. For example, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, the\nproducers of the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica, have both cited Blade\nRunner as one of the major influences for the show. Blade Runner continues to\nreflect modern trends and concerns, and an increasing number consider it one\nof the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was voted the best\nscience fiction film ever made in a poll of 60 eminent world scientists\nconducted in 2004. Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to\nboth the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which itself\nhas been highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade Runner has been\nvery influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk\nderivative biopunk that revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.\nThe film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film\nRegistry in 1993 and is used in university courses. In 2007 it was named the\nsecond-most visually influential film of all time by the Visual Effects\nSociety. Blade Runner is one of the most musically sampled films of the 20th\ncentury. The 2009 album, I, Human, by Singaporean band Deus Ex Machina makes\nnumerous references to the genetic engineering and cloning themes from the\nfilm, and even features a track titled \"Replicant\". Blade Runner has\ninfluenced adventure games such as the 2012 graphical text adventure Cypher,\nRise of the Dragon, Snatcher, the Tex Murphy series, Beneath a Steel Sky, ,\nBubblegum Crisis (and its original anime films), the role-playing game\nShadowrun, the first-person shooter Perfect Dark, and the Syndicate series of\nvideo games. The film is also cited as a major influence on Warren Spector,\ndesigner of the computer-game Deus Ex, which displays evidence of the film's\ninfluence in both its visual rendering and plot. The look of the film,\ndarkness, neon lights and opacity of vision, is easier to render than\ncomplicated backdrops, making it a popular choice for game designers. Blade\nRunner has also been the subject of parody, such as the comics Blade Bummer by\nCrazy comics, Bad Rubber by Steve Gallacci, and the Red Dwarf 2009 three-part\nminiseries, \"\". Among the folklore that has developed around the film over the\nyears has been the belief that the film was a curse to the companies whose\nlogos were displayed prominently as product placements in some scenes. While\nthey were market leaders at the time, Atari, Bell, Cuisinart and Pan Am\nexperienced setbacks after the film's release. The Coca-Cola Company suffered\nlosses during its failed introduction of New Coke in 1985, but soon afterwards\nregaine\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, the main Future Diary anime consists of 26 episodes. There are also additional OVA episodes, but these do not count towards the main series episode count. Therefore, the answer to how many episodes are in the main Future Diary anime is 26 episodes."

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\nTo answer the question about the engine size of a 2006 Chevy Equinox, I'll need to gather information on the available engine options for that model year.\n\n<search>2006 chevy equinox engine options</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: # Chevrolet Equinox) \nThe Chevrolet Equinox is a series of mid-size, later compact crossover SUV\nfrom Chevrolet, introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year.\n\n## First generation (2005–2009)\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox was introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year.\nOriginally, the Equinox was shown at the 2003 Detroit Auto Show. The Pontiac\nTorrent was introduced in 2005 for the 2006 model year. The Pontiac Torrent\nwas originally shown at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show Riding on the GM Theta\nplatform, the unibody is mechanically similar to the Saturn Vue and the Suzuki\nXL7. However, the Equinox and the Torrent are larger than the Vue, riding on a\nwheelbase, longer than the Vue. Front-wheel drive is standard, with optional\nall-wheel drive. They are not designed for serious off-roading like the truck-\nbased Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevrolet TrailBlazer. For the 2006 model year, GM\nupdated the Equinox for the first time, adding GM badges on the front doors,\nas well as recoloring the dashboard panel from gray to black. The first\ngeneration Equinox and Torrent were produced exclusively at the CAMI\nAutomotive GM/Suzuki joint venture plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada. The\n3.4 L LNJ V6 engine is made in China (by Shanghai GM), while the Aisin AF33\ntransmission is made in Japan. Starting with the 2008 model year, the Equinox\nSport and Pontiac GXP were available with a 3.6 L V6 engine that was made in\nthe United States. Production ended in May 2009. The Chevrolet Equinox was not\nsold in Mexico during the 2009 model year.\n\n### Pontiac Torrent\n\nWhile the Torrent shares its basic body structure and mechanicals with the\nEquinox, it does have a different front and rear styling. The suspension (FE2)\nand electronic power steering were both modified to feel firmer and sportier.\nThe Torrent was discontinued after the 2009 model year as part of the\ndiscontinuation of the Pontiac brand, with the last one rolling off the\nassembly line on September 2, 2009. A Buick Theta crossover SUV was to be\nmade, effectively taking place of the Pontiac Torrent. Instead, GM replaced\nthe Torrent with the GMC Terrain, which shares the Theta platform with the\nsecond generation Equinox.\n\n### Engines\n\n### Sport Trims\n\nFor the 2008 and 2009 model years, GM offered sportier versions of the Equinox\nand Torrent; called Sport and GXP, respectively. Featuring the new 3.6 LY7\nDOHC V6 engine paired with a new 6-speed automatic transmission (with Manual\nTap Up/Down shifting capability). This larger and more powerful ( or 40%\nincrease) engine allowed acceleration from 0 to in under seven seconds. These\nmodels also received a lowered ride height with a performance-tuned suspension\nand unique front and rear body kits. The lower stance is accented by the 18\ninch 5-spoke chrome wheels and the absence of the roof rack, giving them a\nsmoother design flow compared to the standard models. The GXP had twin hood\nscoops, hydraulic power-assisted steering (as opposed to the electric power-\nassisted standard Torrent), improved interior trim with unique gauges, and a\ndual chrome-tipped exhaust. Optional features included navigation, heated\nsport leather seats, DVD entertainment system, a sunroof and all-wheel drive.\nGM stated the Equinox Sport was the first vehicle to reflect its more cautious\nnaming standards. Instead of using the Super Sport badge as it had in the past\non higher performance vehicles (such as this one), GM opted to reserve the SS\nnomenclature for special models worthy of its namesake. GM also prominently\npromoted the GXP in television advertisements by touting its horsepower\nadvantage over the BMW X3, in an effort to brand Pontiac more as a direct,\nlow-cost rival to BMW.\n\n### Equinox LTZ\n\nAn Equinox LTZ model was added. It is differentiated by its 17-inch chrome-\nclad aluminum wheels, bright chrome door handles and bright chrome luggage\nrack side rail inserts. Standard interior features include heated front seats,\nleather seating inserts, head curtain side impact air bags, AM/FM st\nDoc 2(Title: olutions and AGA Systems announced that they had begun) offering a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) version of the Chevy Equinox and the\nGMC Terrain using the 2.4 L Direct Injection engine. The natural gas version\nis a \"bi-fuel\" CNG vehicle, meaning that it can run on either gasoline or\nnatural gas, giving it extended range. The Terrain/Equinox were the first\ndirect-injection natural gas vehicles ever approved by the US EPA. Silver\nEagle Distributors, a distributor of Anheuser-Busch products, was the launch\ncustomer for the natural gas version with an initial order of up to 100 of the\nnatural gas GMC Terrains. CenterPoint Energy was an early customer of the\nnatural gas Chevy Equinox.\n\n### CNG configurations\n\nThe CNG version was available as a newly purchased Equinox through select\ndealers or as a retrofit on 2013 and 2014 models. Nat G CNG Solutions offered\nthe vehicle in two options: a two-seater \"cargo version\" and a five-seat\n\"passenger version.\" The cargo version has an 837-mile combined gasoline /\nnatural gas (9.2 gge of CNG) while the passenger version has a 775-mile\ncombined highway range (6.8 gge of CNG).\n\n### Emissions and performance\n\nThe companies claimed that the natural gas version had tested at the EPA lab\nat 31 mpg highway on natural gas and had achieved a Bin 3 emissions equivalent\nto the Toyota Prius.\n\n## Electric conversion\n\nAmp Electric Vehicles sells an all-electric conversion of the Chevrolet\nEquinox.

The third-generation Equinox is available with up to three engine\nchoices. Gasoline engines are identical to the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu: a 1.5L\nturbocharged inline four-cylinder (I4) engine that produces 170 horsepower (12\nhp less than the 2.4L engine in the previous Equinox but more torque), a 2.0L\nturbocharged I4 engine that produces 252 horsepower (48 hp less than the 3.6L\nV6 engine in the previous Equinox), or a 1.6L turbo-diesel I4 engine that\nproduces 136 horsepower (the latter will also be available in future Chevrolet\nCruze models as well). The 3.6L V6 engine option did not carry on to the third\ngeneration. The 2.0L unit will also be paired with a nine-speed automatic\ntransmission. New safety features introduced in the third-generation Equinox\ninclude a surround-view camera, forward collision warning, low-speed automatic\nbraking, a Safety Alert Seat that uses vibration pulses to help alert the\ndriver and avoid crashes, as well as a Rear Seat Alert system that alerts\ndrivers who had opened the back door at the start of a trip to check the back\nseat once they get to their destination, a feature first introduced on the\n2017 GMC Acadia. The third-generation Equinox also introduced a new AWD system\nfrom GKN Driveline, which allows the driver to disengage the driveshaft to\nreduce friction and rotational inertia during the times when AWD is not\nneeded. After the 2019 model year, AWD was no longer offered for the diesel-\npowered Equinox, due to low consumer demand. This generation Equinox is no\nlonger made in the United States.\n\n### Trim levels\n\nChevrolet has released preliminary specifications for the 2018 Equinox. The\nthird-generation Equinox will be available in eight trim levels: L 1.5L Turbo,\nLS 1.5L Turbo, LT 1.5L Turbo, LT 1.6L Turbo Diesel, LT 2.0L Turbo, Premier\n1.5L Turbo, Premier 1.6L Turbo Diesel, and Premier 2.0L Turbo. Each trim level\nwill feature its own list of standard equipment: L/1SM: 1.5L Turbocharged\nInline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, six-speed automatic transmission, Seventeen-\ninch all-season tires, seventeen-inch aluminum alloy wheels, Chevrolet MyLink\ninfotainment system (Seven-inch (7.0\") color touch-screen display, AM/FM\nradio, Bluetooth with A2DP wireless streaming stereo audio, Apple CarPlay and\nAndroid Auto, USB integration, and OnStar 4G LTE connectivity), rear view\nbackup camera system, six-speaker audio system, power windows and door locks,\nkeyless entry, keyless access system, keyless ignition with push-button start,\nand premium cloth seating surfaces. There are no available options for this\ntrim, being the \"base\" Chevrolet Equinox trim and is aimed towards fleet\npurchases, but is still available for public sale. The base trim is available\nonly with Front-Wheel-Drive (FWD) and in only three (neutral only) colors.\nLS/1LS: Sixteen-inch compact spare tire with steel spare wheel. Available\noptions are limited for this trim, being one of the less-expensive Chevrolet\nEquinox trims, but still comes with a couple packages (one of which includes\nprivacy glass) and adds more color options. LT/1LT: Optional 2.0L Turbocharged\nInline Four-Cylinder engine with 9 speed automatic transmission, AWD optional,\nSirius XM Satellite Radio, power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, remote\nstart, High Intensity Discharge (HID) front head lamps, and leather-wrapped\ntransmission gear selector.

OnStar was\nstandard on the 2008 Equinox and Torrent. This system included for Turn-by-\nTurn Navigation, the first factory-installed, fully integrated GPS navigation\nsystem from OnStar. The 2008 models included an enhanced ride and handling\npackage with stiffer shocks, bushings, and tuned spring rates. Four-wheel disc\nbrakes with ABS and tire pressure monitoring system was standard. An\nElectronic Trailer Sway Control was introduced that integrated into the\nstandard StabiliTrak system. This can detect the occurrence of trailer sway\nthat may be caused by improper trailer weight balance or excessive vehicle\nspeed. If the trailer begins to sway, StabiliTrak will apply brakes\nindividually, independent of the driver controlling the brake pedal, to assist\nstabilizing the vehicle. Under these conditions a light will flash to signal\nthe driver to reduce vehicle speed. If trailer sway continues, the system will\nreduce engine torque to reduce the speed of the vehicle. Head curtain side air\nbags were optional.\n\n### Olympic-themed Special Editions\n\nFor the 2008 model year, in tribute to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic\nGames, the Equinox and Torrent each received a special edition; the Team\nCanada Edition and the Podium Edition, respectively. This package added\nchrome-clad wheels, sunroof, premium sound system, and special badging. These\ntrims were sold only in Canada.\n\n## Second generation (2010–2017)\n\nThe second generation Equinox was announced by GM on December 21, 2008, and\ndebuted at the 2009 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The\n2010 Equinox went on sale in June 2009. It is built on a stiffened version of\nthe same \"Theta\" platform used in the previous model. The second generation\nEquinox was built with a pair of upgraded gasoline direct injection engines,\nwith better fuel economy claimed by GM. Earlier 2010 models had the GM badges\non the front doors, but were later deleted. Marketing of Chevrolet Equinox\nresumed in Mexico during late November 2009, for the 2010 model year after a\nyear of absence. Sales of the Chevrolet Equinox to Mexico were stopped after\nthe 2011 model year. However, in October 2015 the Equinox was reintroduced in\nMexico to replace the Captiva Sport for the 2016 model year. The second\ngeneration Equinox is available standard with a 2.4-liter I4 engine produced\nin Tonawanda, New York and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with a 3.0-liter V6 engine\nis available as an option. Both powertrains contain six-speed automatics and\noptional all-wheel-drive systems, with front-wheel-drive being standard. The\nsecond generation Equinox is Chevrolet's third best-selling vehicle in North\nAmerica, after the Silverado and Cruze, respectively.\n\n### Model year changes\n\n#### 2013\n\nFor the 2013 model year, a new direct-injected 3.6L V-6 became available on LT\nand LTZ models, providing 301 horsepower (225 kW) and 272 lb.-ft. of torque\n(369 Nm).

Blue Velvet Metallic and Sea\nGrass Metallic were added to the list of available exterior colors.\n\n#### 2016\n\nFor 2016, the Chevrolet Equinox received its first mid-cycle refresh along\nwith its cousin the GMC Terrain, which was unveiled at the 2015 Chicago Auto\nShow on February 12, 2015. The refreshed Equinox received a new grille,\nheadlights and front fascia as well as reworked tail lights. In the interior,\nthe Equinox gained a new gear selector, a second storage shelf underneath the\ndashboard, as well as deletion of the door lock buttons from the dashboard. A\nnew level trim, L, was introduced as the base level, as LS was made the second\nlevel, followed by LT and another new trim Premier (replacing LTZ for 2017).\nBoth LT1, LT2, and LTZ level trims were discontinued. Premier took the place\nof LTZ. More features are in LTZ and LS trims, while LT is unchanged from\n2015. However, the OnStar delete feature was removed along with the\ndiscontinuation of five color palates, the CD/AM/FM/MP3/WMA Playback audio\nsystem, the rear seat entertainment system and one set of 19-inch chrome\nwheels. In its place are the Chevrolet MyLink system that became standard on\nall trims, four new color palates, and new 17- and 18-inch wheel trims.\n\n### Engines\n\n### EPA fuel economy ratings\n\nSkepticism about the Equinox's EPA fuel economy ratings has been raised after\na number of road tests at the model's launch achieved 20 to 30% lower fuel\neconomy than the official EPA ratings. After achieving in a road test, Edmunds\nInsideLine stated, \"...our testing didn't come close to achieving [the EPA's\nnumbers], even though we're usually within 1 mpg of the EPA combined number. \"\nCar and Driver recorded another figure and noted its \"...fuel economy that\nwon’t live up to the / EPA ratings in real-world use...\". Green Car Reports\nrecorded as much as on a road trip, driving almost exclusively highway miles\nin \"Eco\" mode; this is about 20% below the published highway EPA rating.\nAutoWeek only averaged . The Truth About Cars published an editorial\nsuggesting that GM \"inflated\" the Equinox's fuel economy ratings for public\nrelations purposes and that the trip computer inaccurately reports fuel\neconomy reported to the driver. Motorweek, however, managed to achieve with\ntheir test car during mixed driving. LeftlaneNews.com was also able to average\naverage in mixed city and highway driving.\n\n## Third generation (2018–present)\n\nChevrolet unveiled the third-generation Equinox on the autumnal equinox on\nSeptember 22, 2016. Gasoline-powered variants of the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox\nwent on sale in early 2017, while diesel-powered variants arrived in autumn\n2017. The third-generation Equinox is available with up to three engine\nchoices. Gasoline engines are identical to the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu: a 1.5L\nturbocharged inline four-cylinder (I4) engine that produces 170 horsepower (12\nhp less than the 2.4L engine in the \n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, for the 2006 Chevy Equinox, the engine options included:\n\n- A 3.4 L LNJ V6 engine\n- A 2.4 L I4 engine (though this was not standard and was likely an upgrade option)\n\nTherefore, the primary engine size for the 2006 Chevy Equinox was the 3.4 L LNJ V6 engine."

In general, temperatures on Earth drop by about\n4 °F (2 °C) per each increase in elevation. Throughout the year, high\nelevations across the state tend to be cooler than low elevations. In\naddition, the Cascades, running north–south from border to border, generally\nretain relatively warm Pacific air masses on the western side of the state and\nrelatively cool continental air masses on the eastern side. This prevailing\npattern breaks down occasionally when dense cold air flows down the Columbia\nGorge into the Willamette Valley and lowers temperatures more than usual from\nPortland to Eugene. Oregon has a wide range of temperatures, though the\nextremes are rare. The highest was recorded on July 29, 1898, in Hermiston,\nOregon, and again on August 10, 1898, in Redmond, Oregon, both east of the\nCascades, when the temperature reached . The lowest occurred on February 9,\n1933, in Ukiah, and again on February 10, 1933, in Seneca, also both east of\nthe Cascades, when the temperature dropped to . The temperature in the\nWillamette Valley is mild compared to the desert regions of the state, with\nhigh temperatures at or above occurring only five to fifteen times per year,\nand low temperatures below similarly infrequent.

On average, 192 days per year in Death Valley have\ntemperatures that reach 90 °F or more. Before being moved to Furnace Creek,\nthe weather station at Greenland Ranch averaged 194.4 days annually where\ntemperatures reached 90 °F or more. The lowest temperature recorded at\nGreenland Ranch was in January 1913. The period from July 17–19, 1959, was the\nlongest string of consecutive days where nighttime low temperatures did not\ndrop below . The highest overnight or low temperature recorded in Death Valley\nis , recorded on July 5, 1918, and the current world record for highest\novernight low. As recently as July 12, 2012, the low temperature at Death\nValley dropped to just after a high of on the previous day.

Also on July 12, 2012, the mean\n24-hour temperature recorded at Death Valley was , which makes it the world's\nwarmest 24-hour temperature on record. The average annual precipitation in\nDeath Valley is , while the Greenland Ranch station averaged . The wettest\nmonth on record is January 1995, when fell on Death Valley. The wettest period\non record was mid-2004 to mid-2005, in which nearly of rain fell in total,\nleading to ephemeral lakes in the valley and the region and tremendous\nwildflower blooms. Snow with accumulation has only been recorded in January\n1922, while scattered flakes have been recorded on other occasions.\n\n### Flooding\n\nIn 2005, Death Valley received four times its average annual rainfall of . As\nit has done before for hundreds of years, the lowest spot in the valley filled\nwith a wide, shallow lake, but the extreme heat and aridity immediately began\nevaporating the ephemeral lake. The pair of images (seen at right) from NASA's\nLandsat 5 satellite documents the short history of Death Valley's Lake\nBadwater: formed in February 2005 (top) and evaporated by February 2007\n(bottom). In 2005, a big pool of greenish water stretched most of the way\nacross the valley floor. By May 2005 the valley floor had resumed its more\nfamiliar role as Badwater Basin, a salt-coated salt flats. In time, this\nfreshly dissolved and recrystallized salt will darken. The western margin of\nDeath Valley is traced by alluvial fans. During flash floods, rainfall from\nthe steep mountains to the west pours through narrow canyons, picking up\neverything from fine clay to large rocks. When these torrents reach the mouths\nof the canyons, they widen and slow, branching out into distributary channels.\nThe paler the fans, the younger they are.\n\n## Ecology\n\nIn spite of the overwhelming heat and sparse rainfall, Death Valley exhibits\nconsiderable biodiversity. Wildflowers, watered by snowmelt, carpet the desert\nfloor each spring, continuing into June. Bighorn sheep, red-tailed hawks, and\nwild burros may be seen. Death Valley has over 600 springs and ponds. Salt\nCreek, a mile-long shallow depression in the center of the valley, supports\nDeath Valley Pupfish. These isolated pupfish populations are remnants of the\nwetter Pleistocene climate. Darwin Falls, on the western edge of Death Valley\nMonument, falls into a large pond surrounded by willows and cottonwood trees.\nOver 80 species of birds have been spotted around the pond.\n\n## History\n\nDeath Valley is home to the Timbisha tribe of Native Americans, formerly known\nas the Panamint Shoshone, who have inhabited the valley for at least the past\nmillennium. The Timbisha name for the valley, tümpisa, means \"rock paint\" and\nrefers to the red ochre paint that can be made from a type of clay found in\nthe valley.

Subsequently, the duo's brand of melodic pop\nproduced a record-breaking run of hit recordings on the American Top 40 and\nAdult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock,\neasy listening and adult contemporary music genres. The Carpenters had three\nnumber-one singles and five number-two singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and\nfifteen number-one hits on the Adult Contemporary chart, in addition to twelve\ntop-10 singles.

Their career together ended in 1983 when Karen\ndied from heart failure brought on by complications of anorexia. Extensive\nnews coverage surrounding these circumstances increased public awareness of\neating disorders. Though the Carpenters were criticized for their clean-cut\nand wholesome conservative image in the 1970s, their music has since been re-\nevaluated, attracting critical acclaim and continued commercial success.\n\n## History\n\n### Pre-Carpenters\n\n#### Childhood\n\nThe Carpenter siblings were both born at Grace–New Haven Hospital (now called\nYale–New Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Harold Bertram\n(November 8, 1908 – October 15, 1988) and Agnes Reuwer (née Tatum, March 5,\n1915 – November 10, 1996). Harold was born in Wuzhou, China, moving to Britain\nin 1917, and the US in 1921, while Agnes was born and grew up in Baltimore,\nMaryland. They married on April 9, 1935; their first child, Richard Lynn, was\nborn on October 15, 1946, while Karen Anne followed on March 2, 1950. Richard\nwas a quiet child who spent most of his time at home listening to\nRachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Red Nichols and Spike Jones, and playing the piano.\nKaren was friendly and outgoing; she liked to play sports, including softball\nwith the neighborhood kids, but still spent a lot of time listening to music.\nShe enjoyed dancing and began ballet and tap classes aged four. Karen and\nRichard were close, and shared a common interest in music. In particular, they\nbecame fans of Les Paul and Mary Ford, whose music featured multiple\noverdubbed voices and instruments. Richard began piano lessons aged eight, but\nquickly grew frustrated with the formal direction of the lessons and quit\nafter a year. He had begun to teach himself how to play by ear by 11, and\nresumed studying with a different teacher. He took a greater interest in\nplaying this time, and would frequently practice at home. By age 14, he was\ninterested in performing professionally, and started lessons at Yale School of\nMusic. In June 1963, the Carpenter family moved to the Los Angeles suburb of\nDowney hoping that it would mean better musical opportunities for Richard.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 175 on\nRolling Stone Magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time,\nmaintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. The album contains the hit\nsingles \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" and \"We've Only Just Begun\". The\nformer was the duo's song that gained the Carpenters an international\nreputation for a decade. The album topped the Canadian Albums Chart and peaked\nat #2 on the US Billboard albums chart. It was also successful in the United\nKingdom, entering the top 50 of the official chart for 76 weeks during the\nfirst half of the 1970s.\n\n## Background and song information\n\nDrummer Hal Blaine reported that the Carpenter's parents were in the recording\nstudio for the Close to You album and \"You could tell right away they ruled\nthe roost.\" According to Blaine, Karen's mother dictated her singing style and\nexpressed disapproval that she did not perform as a drummer on all the songs.\nBlaine countered that though Karen was a capable drummer, she was accustomed\nto playing loudly for live performances and thus was not familiar with the\ndifferent requirements of recording in a professional studio; however, she had\nbeen informed beforehand of Blaine's involvement and indicated her approval.\n\"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" was the first Burt Bacharach/Hal David\ncomposition the Carpenters covered. The song was recorded time and time again\nduring the sixties, but didn't do well at all until the Carpenters version. It\nbecame Richard and Karen Carpenter's first RIAA-certified Gold single, as well\nas their first Billboard Hot 100 single that reached the Top 10. It stayed at\nnumber 1 for 4 weeks, and became the Carpenters' iconic song. \"We've Only Just\nBegun\" started out as a commercial for Crocker Citizen's Bank in 1970,\ncomposed by Paul Williams and Roger Nichols. The commercial showed a couple\ngetting married and starting their life together. In August 1970, it became\nthe Carpenters' second RIAA-certified Gold single. Richard regards this as the\nduo's signature song. Originally written by Ralph Carmichael for the early\ncontemporary Christian musical Tell It Like It Is, \"Love Is Surrender\" was a\nsong Richard and Karen heard during their teen years. Several of the overtly\nChristian lyrics were changed for this version, notably from \"Without Him,\nlove is not to be found\" to \"Without love you are not to be found\" and \"You\nmust surrender to His will\" to \"You must surrender if you care.\" The\narrangement is based on one recorded by Carmichael on his album, I Looked for\nLove. The original Carmichael recording was mid-tempo, but Richard recorded it\nup-tempo with extra percussion. The Carpenters' recording is one of only two\ntracks on the album on which Richard Carpenter performs lead vocals. \"Maybe\nIt's You\" is a song written by Richard Carpenter and John Bettis for their\nprevious band, Spectrum. It's a very low-key song, with an oboe solo by Doug\nStrawn. \"Reason to Believe\" is a song composed by Tim Hardin in the 1960s. Rod\nStewart made a hit with it in 1971. Karen claimed in a live concert that the\nreason why they love the song is because it was one of the first songs they\nperformed together as a group. \"Help!\" is a song written by John Lennon and\nPaul McCartney in early 1965. The Carpenters produced four Beatles covers\n(\"Ticket to Ride\", \"Help!\", \"Can't Buy Me Love\" from Your Navy Presents, and\n\"Nowhere Man\"). \"Baby It's You\" is a song composed by Burt Bacharach, Barney\nWilliams, and Mack David. It was sung by Richard and Karen in 1970, and\nperformed on their TV show, Make Your Own Kind of Music. \"I'll Never Fall in\nLove Again\" is the third consecutive Burt Bacharach composition on the album.\nIt was included on their medley the following year, on the album Carpenters.\nAccording to Tom Riddle of Your Navy Presents, there was a 29 part vocal\nharmony on the song.

It is contested by the men's national teams of the\nmembers of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's global\ngoverning body. The tournament generally takes place every four years. Most\nrecently, the 2019 Cricket World Cup, hosted by England and Wales, was won by\nEngland, who beat New Zealand. The current trophy was instituted in 1999. It\nalways remains with the ICC, and a replica is awarded to the winning team. For\nthe 2019 and 2023 World Cups, the host nation and the seven other highest-\nranked nations automatically qualify for the World Cup, while other nations\nincluding associate and affiliate ICC members play in a qualification\ntournament, the World Cup Qualifier. Though an associate member is yet to\nreach the final, Kenya did reach the semi-finals in 2003. Australia is the\nmost successful team in the competition's history, winning five tournaments\nand finishing as runner-up twice. Twice, teams have won successive\ntournaments: the West Indies won the first two editions (1975 and 1979) and\nAustralia won three in a row (1999, 2003 and 2007). Australia has played in\nthe most finals (seven out of Twelve: 1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007,\n2015). England is the team to reach the final and not win the World Cup most\noften, ending as runner-up in all three final appearances before their victory\nin the 2019 tournament. Of the twenty teams that have qualified for at least\none Cricket World Cup, seven have contested a tournament final. Seven venues\nhave hosted the final; only two of those – Lord's, in London, and the\nMelbourne Cricket Ground – have hosted multiple finals. India is the only\ncountry that has hosted a World Cup final at more than one venue, with Eden\nGardens, Kolkata, hosting in 1987 and Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium hosting in\n2011.\n\n## History\n\nThe inaugural ICC Cricket World Cup final was held on 21 June 1975 at Lord's,\ncontested by Australia and the West Indies. A man of the match performance,\nincluding a century, from West Indian captain Clive Lloyd, coming in to bat at\nnumber five with his team at 50/3, formed the basis of a 149-run fourth-wicket\npartnership with Rohan Kanhai. Keith Boyce added a quick 34 and the\nAustralians were set a target of 292 to win in 60 overs. In reply, Alan Turner\nhit 40 from 54 deliveries and Australian captain Ian Chappell scored 62 from\n93 balls. Australia \"contributed to their own destruction\" in an innings with\nfive run outs, and the West Indies were crowned the first cricket world\nchampions, winning by 17 runs. Four years later, the West Indies qualified for\nthe final, this time facing England, hosted at Lord's for the second\nconsecutive tournament. An unbeaten 138 from Viv Richards, and support from\nCollis King in a 139-run partnership for the fifth wicket, saw the West Indies\nset England a target of 287 runs to win in 60 overs. A profitable but slow\nopening partnership between Mike Brearley and Geoffrey Boycott (the latter\ntaking 17 overs to reach double figures) saw England to 129. However,\nfollowing Brearley's dismissal, only Graham Gooch and Derek Randall made a\n\"brief assault\" on the West Indian bowling, before a batting collapse, Joel\nGarner taking five wickets in eleven balls. England ended 194 all out, and\npresented the West Indies with their second consecutive title, winning by 92\nruns. Lord's hosted the third World Cup final in June 1983; this was West\nIndies' third consecutive final. This time they faced India in front of 24,609\nspectators. Sunil Gavaskar was dismissed early in the innings for two runs,\nand only Kris Srikkanth scored more than thirty; Andy Roberts took three\nwickets for the West Indies, leaving India all out for 183. After the\ndismissals of Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes and Larry Gomes by Madan Lal for\nsix runs between them, the West Indies collapsed to 140 all out, handing the\ntitle to India by 43 runs.

Apart from the 2018\nKaringal Bulls reserves premiership winning side it is the most dominant\nsporting team of all time. This also makes them the only team to have won the\nworld cup in all the regions (group of countries) that have hosted the world\ncup till now. Besides, Australia had reached the finals of the 1975 and 1996\nWorld cups losing to West Indies and Sri Lanka respectively. They also reached\nquarterfinals of 2011 Cricket World Cup, and were knocked out in first round\nthree times : 1979, 1983 and 1992. Though they have won world cup record five\ntimes, they are also the only team considered as tournament favorites for\nevery world cup, right from 1975 to present. The team has played total 85\nworld cup matches, the highest of any team. Its overall win-loss record is\n61-21 (which gives it the highest win percentage among all teams playing the\nworld cup), with one tied match and two being abandoned due to rain.\n\n## Cricket World Cup Record\n\nWhite: Group/Round-Robin Stage\n\n### Teamwise record\n\n## Australia at 1975 Cricket World Cup\n\nThe 1975 Cricket World Cup was the first Cricket World Cup. It was held in\nEngland in June 1975 and consisted of two weeks of one-day matches played\n60-overs-a-side. The format consisted of a group stage, in which each team\nplayed the other three teams in its group of four. The top two teams from both\ngroups would progress to the semifinals. Australia was paced in group B along\nwith Pakistan, West Indies and Sri Lanka. For this world cup, the Australian\nside was led by Ian Chappell. The ODI format of cricket at that time was new\nfor most teams, and Australia was among more experienced one day cricket teams\nat that time, with a decent batting and bowling lineup. So they were\nconsidered among tournament favorites. Australia first played Pakistan at\nLeeds, and as expected, won the match. Australia won the toss and elected to\nbat first. All top order batsmen played well( Alan Turner, Rick McCosker, Ian\nChappell and Greg Chappell). A quick 80 run off 94 balls of Ross Edwards took\nAustralia to 278/7. Then a five wicket haul of Dennis Lillee helped Australia\nto bundle out Pakistan for 205. Australia then played non test playing Sri\nLanka and were expected to easily win against the minnows. But though they\nwon, their winning was not that one sided as expected. Once again Turner\nplayed well scoring a century (101 runs, 113 balls) and took Australia to\nmammoth 328. But Sri Lanka's batsmen played well and despite of Australia's\nstrong bowling attack, were able to reach 276 in 60 overs. This match was also\naccompanied by lot of drama, as Sunil Wettimuny and Duleep Mendis got retired\nhurt off Dennis Lillee's and Jeff Thomson's deliveries, and were playing well.\nIn fact, Sri Lanka could have won the match if they remained at the crease.\nWith this win, Australia progressed to the semifinals. The last group match of\nAustralia was with West Indies, the team who was dominating world cricket at\nthat time. West Indies won the toss and elected to field first. Except of Ross\nEdwards and Rod Marsh, who showed resistance scoring half centuries, the rest\nof the Australian lineup struggled against West Indian bowling attack led by\nAndy Roberts and Keith Boyce, and Australia were all out for 192. None of the\nAustralian bowlers could make an impact as West Indies chased down the target\nwith ease. With this loss, Australia finished second in group B and had to\nface England in semifinals. Australia won the toss and choose to field on a\nbowling friendly wicket. The Australians dominated the first innings, and with\nthe help of Gary Gilmour who took six wickets, bundled out England for 93.\nHowever, they received a terrible setback in second innings as they were\nreduced to 39/6. From then on, Gilmour and Doug Walters played patiently and\ntook Australia to an u\nDoc 3(Title: # 2011 Cricket World Cup Final) \nThe 2011 Cricket World Cup Final was a One Day International (ODI) match\nplayed between India and Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, India on 2\nApril 2011, Saturday.

The CJI also heads their administrative functions. As\nhead of the supreme court, the chief justice is responsible for the allocation\nof cases and appointment of constitutional benches which deal with important\nmatters of law. In accordance with Article 145 of the Constitution of India\nand the Supreme Court Rules of Procedure of 1966, the chief justice allocates\nall work to the other judges who are bound to refer the matter back to him or\nher (for re-allocation) in any case where they require it to be looked into by\na larger bench of more judges. On the administrative side, the chief justice\ncarries out the following functions: maintenance of the roster; appointment of\ncourt officials and general and miscellaneous matters relating to the\nsupervision and functioning of the Supreme Court. However this convention has\nbeen broken twice. In 1973, Justice A. N. Ray was appointed superseding 3\nsenior judges.

The CJI also heads their administrative functions. As\nhead of the supreme court, the chief justice is responsible for the allocation\nof cases and appointment of constitutional benches which deal with important\nmatters of law. In accordance with Article 145 of the Constitution of India\nand the Supreme Court Rules of Procedure of 1966, the chief justice allocates\nall work to the other judges who are bound to refer the matter back to him or\nher (for re-allocation) in any case where they require it to be looked into by\na larger bench of more judges. On the administrative side, the chief justice\ncarries out the following functions: maintenance of the roster; appointment of\ncourt officials and general and miscellaneous matters relating to the\nsupervision and functioning of the Supreme Court. However this convention has\nbeen broken twice. In 1973, Justice A. N. Ray was appointed superseding 3\nsenior judges. Also, in 1975 Justice Mirza Hameedullah Beg was appointed as\nthe CJI superseding Justice Hans Raj Khanna. The present CJI is Justice Sharad\nArvind Bobde, and is the 47th CJI since 26 January 1950, the year the\nConstitution came into effect and the supreme court came into being. He\nsucceeded Justice Ranjan Gogoi on 18 November 2019, and will remain in office\ntill 23 April 2021, the day he retires on turning 65 years of age.\n\n## Appointment\n\nWhile appointing the Chief Justice, The President usually consults judges of\nthe Supreme Court and High Court and makes a decision based on the information\ngiven\n\n## Removal\n\nArticle 124(4) of Constitution of India lays down the procedure for removal of\na judge of Supreme Court which is applicable to Chief Justice as well. Once\nappointed, the chief justice remains in the office until the age of 65 years.\nHe can be removed only through a process of impeachment by Parliament as\nfollows:\n\n## Acting President\n\nThe president (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969 of India provides that the\nchief justice of India (CJI) shall act as the president of India in the event\nof the offices of both the president and the vice president being vacant. When\nPresident Zakir Hussain died in office, Vice President V. V. Giri, acted as\nthe president. Later, Mr. Giri resigned as the vice president. The CJI,\nJustice Mohammad Hidayatullah then became the acting president of India. As\nper the convention, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court became the\nacting CJI. When the newly elected president took office a month later,\nJustice Hidayatullah reverted as the chief justice of India.\n\n## List of chief justices of India\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe Constitution of India gives the power of deciding remuneration as well as\nother conditions of service of the chief justice to the Parliament of India.\nAccordingly, such provisions have been laid down in The Supreme Court Judges\n(Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958. This remuneration was revised\nin 2006-2008, after the sixth central pay commission's recommendation.\n\n## 2018 crisis\n\nIn 2018, in an unprecedented act, four supreme court justices spoke out\nagainst the CJI Dipak Misra. Prior to Misra, no CJI had ever been indicted for\nfraud. Since then, the post of the CJI and the Supreme Court in general has\ncome under increased scrutiny. Though the CJI's powers and duties have been\nconsidered equivalent to the other justices of the Supreme Court, under Misra,\nthe court established the CJI as the \"Master of Roster\" and pronounced that\nthe CJI “alone has the prerogative to constitute the benches of the court and\nallocate cases to the benches so constituted” even if the case involved\naccusations against the CJI him/herself, thus creating the provision to\nviolate the in causa sua principle of natural justice.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n  * Official website of Supreme Court of India\n  * Photo Gallery of Former Chief Justices of India\n</information>\n\n\n<answer> The current Chief Judge of the Gujarat High Court is Justice Vikram Nath.

The screenplay by Nick Hornby is based on Cheryl Strayed's 2012\nmemoir . The film stars Reese Witherspoon as Strayed, alongside Laura Dern (as\nStrayed's mother), with Thomas Sadoski, Michiel Huisman and Gaby Hoffmann. The\nfilm premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on August 29, 2014, and was\nreleased theatrically on December 3, 2014, in North America. Wild opened to\npositive reviews, with praise for the performances of Reese Witherspoon and\nLaura Dern. Both actresses received Oscar nominations for their performances,\nin the categories of Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn June 1995, despite a lack of hiking experience, recent divorcée Cheryl\nStrayed (Reese Witherspoon) leaves Minneapolis, Minnesota, to hike 1,100 miles\nof the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail on a journey of self-discovery and\nhealing. During the hike, Strayed reflects in flashbacks on her childhood in\nMinnesota and memories of her mother, Bobbi Grey (Laura Dern). Bobbi's death\nfrom cancer sent Cheryl into a deep depression that she tried to numb with\nheroin and anonymous sex, which eventually destroyed her marriage to her\nhusband Paul (Thomas Sadoski). After finding out she was pregnant, Strayed got\nan abortion and resolved to hike the trail to redeem herself. Strayed begins\nher trek in the Mojave Desert in Southern California with her backpack. On the\nfirst night, she discovers she has brought the wrong type of gas for her stove\nand is therefore unable to cook food. After a few more days, Strayed meets\nFrank (W. Earl Brown), a farmer and construction worker who takes her in for\nthe night and with his wife offers her a home-cooked meal and a warm shower.\nStrayed meets a hiker named Greg (Kevin Rankin) who agrees to meet her at\nKennedy Meadows, California. Upon arrival, she meets a camper named Ed (Cliff\nDeYoung) who helps Strayed strategically lighten her overweight backpack and\nconvinces her to replace her undersized hiking boots with a new pair, to be\ndelivered to a future stop on the trail. Strayed continues her hike into\nNorthern California despite Greg's warnings of deep snowfall. After removing a\nboot to remove a loose toenail, the boot accidentally falls down an\ninaccessibly deep slope, forcing her to continue the journey wearing sandals\nreinforced with duct tape. Strayed's best friend Aimee (Gaby Hoffmann) sends\nher provisions to stops along the trail, including letters that congratulate\nher on her progress. Strayed also receives letters from her ex-husband Paul\nalong the way. On the morning of Day 58, Strayed is out of water and\ndesperately licks the dew off her tent. Dehydrated and near exhaustion, she\nsiphons water from a muddy puddle. While she waits for her water to disinfect,\ntwo hunters approach, one making suggestive remarks that leave Strayed feeling\nthreatened and vulnerable. This causes her to quickly leave and run away.\nStrayed makes her way out of California and arrives in Ashland, Oregon, where\nshe meets a man named Jonathan (Michiel Huisman), with whom she attends a\ntribute concert to Jerry Garcia and later spends the night. Days later,\nStrayed arrives at Mount Hood National Forest and encounters a friendly group\nof young hikers who share their experiences. The hikers recognize her from the\nsignatures she's been leaving in the hiker's record books along the PCT.\nStrayed frequently leaves quotes or poems that are meaningful to her along her\njourney. One rainy day, Strayed finds a llama that escaped from a young boy\nhiking with his grandmother (Anne Gee Byrd). Strayed chats with the boy, who\nasks her about her parents. After she mentions her mother's death, the boy\nsings \"Red River Valley\" to Strayed, saying it is a song his mother used to\nsing to him. After the boy and his grandmother carry on down the trail,\nStrayed breaks down and cries.

The main horse trainer was Bobby Lovgren, and other\nhorse trainers included Dylan Jones, Bill Lawrence, and Zelie Bullen. During\nfilming, fourteen different horses were used as the main horse character Joey,\neight of them portraying him as an adult animal, four as a colt and two as a\nfoal; four horses played the other main equine character, Topthorn. Up to 280\nhorses were used in a single scene. A farrier was on set to replace horseshoes\nsucked off in the mud during filming, and the horses playing the main horse\ncharacters had a specialist equine make-up team, with their coats dyed and\nmarkings added to ensure continuity. Equine artist Ali Bannister was\nresponsible for the 'hair and make-up' of the horses, as well as drawing the\nsketches of horses that are featured in the film. Extra filming involving a\nbay foal took place in California in March 2011. Working with horses on this\nscale was a new experience for Spielberg, who commented: \"The horses were an\nextraordinary experience for me, because several members of my family ride. I\nwas really amazed at how expressive horses are and how much they can show what\nthey're feeling.\" Representatives of the American Humane Association were on\nset at all times, and the Association awarded the film an \"outstanding\" rating\nfor the care that was taken of all the animals during the production. However,\na 2013 suit by former AHA employee Barbara Casey alleges that a horse was\nkilled on set, but the organisation chose to \"cover-up the death\" to protect\nSpielberg's reputation. An animatronic horse was used for some parts of the\nscenes where Joey is trapped in barbed wire; the wire was rubber prop wire.\n\n### Post-production\n\nFilm editor Michael Kahn spoke of his work on the film: \"We have some shots in\nWar Horse that are just fantastic … We shot it in Devon, and you know it's\ngorgeous down there, and the horses are beautiful and the farms are beautiful,\nbeautiful scenery and every shot is gorgeous, and eventually you get to the\nwar part of it and it's really, really something.\" Kahn had a trailer on set\nand edited the film during filming. Kahn and Spielberg cut the film digitally\non an Avid, rather than on film, a first time with this technology for\nSpielberg: \"He decided that he'd like to try it\", Kahn commented. After\nfilming, further editing was undertaken at the U.K.'s Twickenham Film Studios,\nwith the production moving back to the U.S. in November 2010. Kahn also said\nof his work on the film: \"We put together here in Hollywood. It worked well …\nThose English actors are awfully good and so were the horses. The horses were\nbeautifully trained. For an editor there were a lot of match [frame] problems\nwith the horses but the shooting was so good that I got everything I needed.\"\nThe film score by John Williams was recorded in late March and early April\n2011. Tuba player Jim Self reported in May 2011: \"For John Williams I [sic]\nrecently finished recording for the film War Horse. It's a war movie so the\nscore has a lot of brass—but it was gentle music often.\" English folk singer\nJohn Tams, who wrote the songs for the stage production of War Horse, was\napproached by Spielberg and Williams about including one of his songs from the\nstageshow in the film.

In\nSeptember 2012 the 4,000th Papa John's Pizza restaurant opened, in New Hyde\nPark, New York. The company celebrated the event by giving away 4,000 free\npizzas to customers throughout New York City.

In February 2018,\nPapa John's and the NFL mutually agreed to end their sponsorship agreement\nafter Schnatter's criticism of the NFL made headlines. On July 11, 2018, news\noutlets reported that during a conference call with Papa Johns' marketing\nagency Laundry Services, Schnatter had used the word \"nigger\" by saying\n\"Colonel Sanders called blacks niggers and Sanders never faced public\nbacklash.\" Schnatter alleged that referencing the quote by the KFC founder was\nmeant to convey his dislike for racism. After the call, the owner of the\nmarketing agency moved to end their contract with Papa John's. Schnatter\nresigned as chairman of the board on the same day the incident was reported.\nAfter the incident, Ritchie apologized in an open letter and ordered the\ncompany's workforce to undergo bias and diversity training. On July 26, 2018,\nJohn Schnatter filed a lawsuit against Papa John's Pizza to give him access to\nthe company's books and records after they fired him from the company after\nthe teleconference call scandal.
