More Affordable Housing\nOne of the most common reasons people move to the suburbs is affordability.\nIn many cities, housing prices and rent can be significantly higher than in nearby suburban areas.\nAdditionally, suburbs offer larger homes, more land, and often at a lower price per square foot, making them ideal for growing families or first-time homebuyers.\nYou may also like to read: Moving to a Bigger Home. In this guide, we examine the pros and cons, as well as alternatives, to moving to a larger home.\nYou may also like to compare what the cost of living is in the city compared with the suburbs using this tool at www.numbeo.com\n#2. More Space and Privacy\nCity apartments typically offer less living space, have shared walls, and are often located near one another.\nSuburban homes typically offer more space, both indoors and outdoors. Yards, driveways, and additional rooms provide greater comfort and privacy, which is perfect for families, remote workers, or anyone needing extra room.\n#3. Better Schools\nThe quality of education is a top priority for many families, and suburban public schools are often better funded and rated higher than their urban counterparts.\nThis makes the suburbs attractive to parents seeking strong academic opportunities for their children.\nYou may also like to read: How to Choose a Good School. In this guide, we suggest things to take into consideration when choosing a new school for your children.\n#4. Safer Neighborhoods\nSuburban areas tend to have lower crime rates compared to cities.\nObviously, not all suburbs are equal, but many offer better security and community vigilance, making them feel safer.\n#5. Access to Nature and Outdoor Activities\nLiving in the suburbs often means being closer to parks and green spaces. A suburban lifestyle supports a more outdoor-oriented and active way of life.\n#6. Less Noise and Pollution\nCities are known for being frantic and crowded, which often comes with noise, air pollution, and stress. The suburbs offer a quieter, cleaner environment, which can be beneficial to mental and physical health.\nYou may also like to read: Cheap Local Moving Options. In this guide, we suggest various ways that you can make the move from the city to the suburbs cheaper.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Panic Move To The Suburbs\") With Covid-19 hitting large cities the hardest, people have started looking to the suburbs.\nHeadlines like “Coronavirus Escape: To the Suburbs” in the New York Times, “Coronavirus: Americans flee cities for the suburbs” in USA Today, “Will the Coronavirus Make the Suburbs Popular Again?” in Architectural Digest suggest an impending mass exodus to suburbia.\nAnd according to some reports, more than a third of Americans are considering moving to less populated areas.\nHowever, other data suggests that the figures are a bit lower.\nA recent survey by apartment rental platform PropertyNest found that only 13.8% of people surveyed planned to move either out of state, out of the city, out of their borough, or into a new home within the city.\nIt’s also not only Americans who are falling in love with the suburbs. The same pattern can be seen in Canada and the UK, among other places.\nRegardless of how many people are actually moving, it’s clear there’s an increased desire to seek greener, less-Covid-y, pastures.\nAnd while suburbia may seem like a good idea given the current circumstances, long-term it’s probably worse for you.\nAs Amanda Mull warns in a recent Atlantic article: “fleeing a big city because of the pandemic is a bigger gamble than it might seem.”\n“Those who panic-move could soon find that the future of work and cities is far different from what they expected,” she wrote, explaining that banking on permanent remote working could be risky.\nFor example, Facebook has already made it clear it will slash workers’ pay if they move to a less expensive place. This cost-cutting tactic is common among employers whose workers retain their jobs when they move to cheaper areas.\nBut pay cuts aside, moving to a suburban community is also pretty bad for your physical and mental health.\nFirst, there’s the process of moving. Like childbirth, it’s easy to forget the pain when it comes to moving after you’ve done it but relocating can unbelievably taxing to your mental health.\nIn a New York Times article on the psychology of moving, Ronnie Greenberg, a Manhattan psychoanalyst explained, “Panic can really set in around your home and your apartment. It’s a matrix of safety, so moving is incredibly stressful and people don’t realize it.”\nA poll conducted last year by Yopa of 2,000 UK homeowners, found that 40% of people thought the process of moving house as the most nerve-wracking life event. More nerve-wracking than getting a divorce, having a baby, or starting a new job.\nAlso if you have children, the transition has been shown to negatively impact their emotional well-being.\nOne study in published in 2017 that looked at 14,775 children in the UK over period of years found that moving may have a detrimental impact on their subsequent mental health.\nAnother study published in 2015 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health found that kids who have moved five or more times during their childhood are three times more likely to experience mental health problems compared to those who stay in their hometowns. The researchers also found that moving was significantly more damaging to older children who have to leave behind friends and change schools.\n“Moving house can be a hugely stressful experience for the parents and the family as a whole as it can be associated with change in social environment and networks, and other aspects of the physical and social environment,” explained the study’s lead author Foteini Tseliou in an interview with Reuters.\nBut the challenges don’t stop after you’ve moved.\nHuman beings have an innate need to socialize with one another and even without Covid-19 the suburbs make it really hard to do that. It doesn’t matter if you just moved there or have lived there for years – their design is inherently isolating.\n''A culture of impersonality has developed in the suburbs by the way they're laid out,'' Jonathan Barnett, author of \"The Fractured Metropolis\" and former professor of regional planning at the University of Penns\nDoc 3(Title: \"Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Panic Move To The Suburbs\") just moved there or have lived there for years – their design is inherently isolating.\n''A culture of impersonality has developed in the suburbs by the way they're laid out,'' Jonathan Barnett, author of \"The Fractured Metropolis\" and former professor of regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, told The New York Times in 1999.\nThink pieces examining why we feel depressed in the suburbs point to the lack of well-defined spaces and natural order, as well as the added effort it takes to socialize when everything is so spread out.\nAs David Roberts writes in Vox: “The neighborhoods are made for cars, not kids. So kids stay inside playing Xbox, and families don't leave except to drive somewhere.”\nBut as studies have shown, repeated spontaneous contact is the key to making friends, especially as you get older.\nYet, repeated spontaneous contact is virtually impossible in the suburbs. Seriously, where are you gonna run into someone? The mall?\nPlus don’t forget it’s just naturally harder to keep up with friends as we age, no matter where we live.\nAll this compounded with the added stress of being in a new place without your usual support systems is bound to have knock-on effects.\nFor example, research shows that people who don’t have strong social connections are more anxious, lonely, and depressed.\nAnd according to one study in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, social isolation or the lack of social connection can increase mortality risk by 29% and 32%, respectively.\nBut it’s not only mental health that is negatively effected by living in the suburbs. Several studies have shown that suburban living has negative physical health consequences.\nOne study published in 2004 found that people who lived in areas where there’s more urban sprawl were more likely to be overweight and obese.\nAnother study published in the same year, found that people who lived in more spread out suburban communities also reported more chronic health problems, like high blood pressure, arthritis, headaches, and breathing difficulties, than those who live in urban areas.\nThis link remained significant even after the researchers controlled for factors like age, economic status, race, and local environment that might help explain the disparity.\nSo before you put that down payment on a three-bedroom house in a suburban cul-de-sac ask yourself: is it really worth it?\nDoc 4(Title: \"How women’s life-long experiences of being judged by their ...\") A key reason many organisations want to move their employees to open-plan workspaces is to encourage collaboration and improve communication. The assumption is that the increased visibility and access workers have to one another will ease the flow of information and enhance learning, well-being, and collegiality.\nResearch suggests that, in some circumstances, this can indeed be the outcome. But another study recently found exactly the opposite, with workers engaging in 73% fewer face-to-face interactions, along with a 67% increase in electronic communication.\nRead more: A new study should be the final nail for open-plan offices\nIt is not just face-to-face communication that becomes worse in open-plan offices. There are findings that satisfaction decreases, well-being is impacted, privacy decreases, and people become less friendly.\nOne undeniable aspect of open-plan offices is the increased exposure and access to others they offer. This is sometimes deemed a benefit - particularly because it increases opportunities to learn from, and network with, high-status colleagues. But our research suggests that being more visible may not be good for everyone.\nRead more: Get out of my face! We're more antisocial in a shared office space\nGender differences\nOur study in a large open-plan law firm in Auckland found that, although occupants generally liked this well designed work environment, there was a gender difference in the responses. Every survey respondent who specifically mentioned being visible, watched, observed, exposed or more accountable was a woman. The male occupants, it seems, were oblivious to their increased exposure. This difference in responses was especially striking since we did not set out to explore the gender effects of open-plan work spaces.\nIt wasn’t that all the women especially disliked being so exposed. In fact, being visible came up several times when they were describing positive aspects of the space, outlining how the open office improved their productivity. One lawyer said:\nOverall the effect on my productivity is positive - can always be seen, so always working unless nobody is around.\nAnother woman commented:\nKnowing that other people can see what I am doing also motivates me to be productive.\nBut this female lawyer was keenly aware of the downside of being so visible:\nI don’t like that sometimes it feels like people are judging you for not giving enough face time as everything is so visible. Back at [previous office] there was more of a motto of getting the work done in the time needed and then go home. Now, with open space, it feels more like a fish bowl and I have noticed more subtle pressure to stay later even if you don’t technically need to - based on looks some seniors, even from entirely different teams, give you.\nOther research looking at the effect of working in a glass open-plan, largely transparent office, revealed the unexpected outcome of women becoming hyper-aware of being continually observed and evaluated, just as we found. Women (but not men) in this study reported becoming more image conscious, changing the way they dressed, how and where they walked, and feeling exposed.\nWhy is this? Are women really being looked at more than their male colleagues?\nResearch into the male gaze and surveillance behaviour on nudist beaches suggests they are. But, whether they are or not, women are socialised, practically from birth, to believe they are being looked at.\nEvaluated on appearance\nThrough their life experiences and their exposure to media, women and girls learn that they are almost constantly being evaluated and appraised. Women are aware of being observed in a way that men are not, simply because their life experiences have routinely included instances of being looked at.\nEvery time a girl is told she is cute or pretty, or even described in gender-neutral, objective terms such as being tall, she is actually being told she is being looked at and assessed on her appearance. Boys are far more like\nDoc 5(Title: \"Reasons Why Laws Change - Year 12 Legal Studies\") anging values within the community for example the legalisation of abortion and the banning of smoking in pubs/clubs and in cars with minors.\nChanging community awareness:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community awareness. As a national community, we are much more informed today and aware of relevant issues largely due to the speed and efficiency of communication. As informed citizens, we put pressure on law makers to amend or introduce legislation in areas that we believe need to change. For example, Brodie's law was introduced in 2011 after a teenager ended her life due to bullying at a café where she worked. This law now makes it a serious crime (punishable by up to 10 years) to bully others in the workplace and holds spreads the responsibility of ending bullying.\nChanging Expectations of the Legal System:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to the change expectations towards our legal system. Years ago, laws were expected to regulate behaviour however people now expect the law to uphold individual rights as well as protect people from harm. As such, the law has needed to take a more active role to ensure that it remains relevant. Examples of these include online defamation, duty of care and negligence.\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the articles, people move to the suburbs primarily for the following reasons:\n\n1. **More Affordable Housing**: Suburban areas often offer larger homes at a lower price per square foot, making them ideal for growing families or first-time homebuyers.\n\n2. **More Space and Privacy**: Suburban homes typically offer more indoor and outdoor space, providing greater comfort and privacy.\n\n3. **Better Schools**: Suburban public schools are often better funded and rated higher than their urban counterparts, making them attractive to parents seeking strong academic opportunities for their children.\n\n4. **Safer Neighborhoods**: Suburban areas tend to have lower crime rates compared to cities, offering a safer environment.\n\n5. **Access to Nature and Outdoor Activities**: Living in the suburbs often means being closer to parks and green spaces, supporting a more outdoor-oriented and active way of life.\n\n6. **Less Noise and Pollution**: Suburbs offer a quieter, cleaner environment, which can be beneficial to mental and physical health.\n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to moving to the suburbs, such as longer commutes, reduced social interaction, and potential negative impacts on mental and physical health. </think>\n\n<answer> People move to the suburbs primarily for more affordable housing, more space and privacy, better schools, safer neighborhoods, access to nature and outdoor activities, and less noise and pollution. </answer>",

    "question": "why do corns grow so much in the aztec empire",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, it seems the Aztecs were highly dependent on corn (maize) as a staple food and their agricultural practices were advanced. Corn was central to their diet, religious practices, and economy. The Aztecs' agricultural methods, such as using chinampas, ensured a stable and abundant corn supply. Therefore, it's more likely that the term \"grow\" refers to the increased consumption of corn rather than the corn itself growing more. The Aztecs likely experienced a population growth or economic prosperity that increased their demand for corn. </think>\n\n<answer> The Aztecs likely experienced increased corn production due to population growth or economic prosperity, which increased their demand for corn as a staple food. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> To answer this question, I need to consider the context of the Aztec Empire and what might have led to an increase in corn production or consumption. The Aztecs were known for their agricultural practices, particularly in farming maize (corn). However, the term \"grow\" in relation to corn could refer to either increased cultivation or population growth that required more corn. Let's start by considering the agricultural practices of the Aztecs.</think>\n\nThe Aztecs were skilled farmers who practiced intensive agriculture, including the use of chinampas (floating gardens) in Lake Texcoco. They had a well-organized system of crop rotation and irrigation. Corn was a staple food, and its importance is reflected in their religious and cultural practices.\n\n<search> agricultural practices of the Aztec Empire and corn production </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Aztec Food - Aztec History\") Aztec food was a rich combination of many foods that we take for granted today. Not only is much of this rich diet still common in Mexico today, it's spread around the world. Here's a look at some of what the ancient Mexica peoples ate:\nMaize (also called corn or mealies) was the staple grain of the Aztec empire. Maize has been domesticated for thousands of years, and it likely first came into common use in Mexico, spreading to the rest of the world from there. Mexico is still one of the world's top maize growing countries. Corn could be ground into flour and used to make tortillas (a sort of flat bread, sometimes used to wrap a filling to make tacos), tamales and even drinks. Corn has transformed the world perhaps more than any other food. Today it's used not only in food, including candy and of course feeding the cattle that is eaten, it's even used in things like sticky tape and making boxes.\nHow did all this food grow? Find out about Aztec farming here.\nAztec food also included beans and squash. Of course, maize and beans are still a cornerstone of the Mexican diet, a healthy combination especially if you're not eating a lot of meat.\nTo add to these three, the Mexicas (people of the Aztec Empire) ate chillies, tomatoes, limes, cashews, potatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and of course chocolate. The Mexicas domesticated bees for honey, and turkeys for meat and eggs, also dogs and duck. They hunted and fished as well, and used animals such as deer, rabbits, iguana, fish and shrimp for food. Even insects, such as grasshoppers and worms were harvested. These various types of meat made up only a very minor part of the Aztec food that was eaten.\nOne of the greatest gifts to the world from Mexico is chocolate. The cocoa bean was highly treasured in the Aztec Empire. In fact, the bean was used as a currency, as well as Aztec food. Or, in this case, drink.\nThe cocoa beans were used to make a thick chocolate drink, but far different than the hot chocolate we know today. Since they didn't use sugar, the Mexicas added peppers, corn meal and spices. A similar hot drink is still found in Mexico today with corn, known as atole.\nThough Columbus brought cocoa to Europe in the early 1500s, it was mostly ignored. Hernan Cortes was more interested, and substituted sugar and vanilla for the spices. It became a commercial success.\nThe word chocolate even comes from an Aztec/Mayan word chocolatl.\nChocolate actually may have played a part in the fall of the Aztec empire. The Aztecs believed that the god Quetzalcoatl brought the cocoa beans from the tree of life to give to man. Later, the god was banished. It seems that at first the Mexicas believed that Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquerer, was their returning god.\nThere are some excellent recipes available online.

City of Machu Picchu boasted 100 acres of temples, plazas, barracks, and houses. All land held by emperor in trust for people. Communication in quipu, complex bundles of colored and knotted string.\nReligion: Sun god above all.\nEncounter: Their gold and silver seduced Pizarro, who, aided by smallpox and civil wars, conquered the empire.\nChurch’s Impact\n•Spanish culture: Charles I, king of Spain, prohibited non-Spanish clergy from going to the Americas. So Latin America became marked by the unique qualities of Spanish Catholicism.\n•Depopulation: Spanish expansion into the Americas caused rapid depopulation. Some scholars estimate that when Columbus arrived, there were 44,000,000 native Americans. Just 150 years later, there were only 5,600,000. What caused the dramatic drop? European diseases (such as smallpox), wars and slaughters, and forced labor or slavery. Many Christians did, however, speak out against the atrocities and try to alleviate the natives’ sufferings.\n•Schools and hospitals: By 1820, there were 25 universities and 56 secondary schools, most started and run by monastic orders, as well as numerous hospitals.\n•Church and state: Church and state were united and controlled all facets of life. By 1805 Alexander von Humboldt estimated that in some provinces of Mexico the church directly or indirectly controlled 80 percent of the land.\n•Hierarchical society: Society was stratified with the Spanish-born Peninsulares at the top; their American-born children (Creoles) next, the “mixed-blood” mestizos next; the Indians and black slaves at the bottom.

The meat industry is not only damaging farmed animals, but also wild ones – and especially the ones in danger of extinction. Studies warn that meat-eaters are actually speeding worldwide animals extinction.\nBy killing them, we are killing ourselves\nOur appetite for beef, for dairy, for fish is wiping out animals, and even threatening our own survival.\n“You eat a steak, you kill a lemur in Madagascar. You eat a chicken, you kill an Amazonian parrot”, says geophysicist expert Gidon Eshel, in order to make people realise the full impact of meat consumption on biodiversity.\nBeef, dairy, and fishing industries are today the leading cause of extinction. This also connects to the loss of habitat due to land clearing, but also overfishing and pollution.\nFirst, the vast majority of land clearing is to graze cattle for the meat industry, and to raise crops to feed farmed animals. Can you imagine that currently almost one-third of our planet’s surface is used for these purposes alone, and that this trend is even increasing? This is crazy. Almost 80% of former Amazon forests are now used for grazing cattle for meat.\nBy doing this, we are not only destroying the natural habitat of countless animals, but we are also destroying the ‘lungs of the Earth’, and as a consequence our own life.\nFor what concerns fishing, the greatest extinction danger is over-exploitation: in other words, we are fishing them to extinction in order to satisfy our needs.\nIn addition, many experts have explored the links between modern livestock production and other issues such as climate change and pollution; which eventually lead to animal extinction. For example, animal agriculture is responsible for almost 15% of climate emissions on a world scale, more than all the cars, trains, and planes.\nMeat-eaters are supporting the unsustainable production practices of the meat industry, and as a consequences they are speeding worldwide species extinction rate. We must change the way we eat and produce ‘food’: the current situation is having a catastrophic impact on almost all animal species across the globe.\nEvery meal counts\nBy eating less meat – whether one day a week or one meal a day – you will lower your dietary carbon footprint and take a step to protect wildlife.\nIf you change your eating habits, you will change the agricultural food market. This will result in more sustainable industries – because the meat demand-supply relation will be changed forever. It is simple: if you don’t demand, they won’t produce.\nA plant-based diet (or at least a diet which involves reducing the amount of meat and fish you eat) is one of the easiest, yet stronger ways, to use our planet’s resources more responsibly, and protect animals at the same time. In addition, plant-based food uses less water, have a lower impact on the environment, and guess what…it’s delicious.\nSo why don’t you save a Lemur and a Parrot today?!\n5. Spread Awareness: get involved\nTell the world! Let’s Stop the sixth mass extinction.\nTalk to your family and friends. If you can’t convince them to change their habits, at least try to warn them, and make them more aware of their actions.

And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") lly damaging industry, and aside from the fact it makes so many people who consume it sick, dairying affects people in another important way. When we overproduce milk we are being recklessly wasteful of land, water, feed and farmers’ time. Wouldn’t these vital resources be better used in the production of nutritious plant-based foods that are sustainable and essential for optimal health?\nInstead of situating these damaging animal-based industries among poor, underserved communities, often predominantly inhabited by people of color, wouldn’t it be better to grow healthful plant foods that can be made locally available? ‘Food deserts’ is a term commonly used for areas where affordable, healthful food is in short supply, but food justice activists instead talk about ‘food apartheid’, as this issue connects directly to a systemic racism inherent in the food system.\nThere is much that is damaging about the dairy industry, and that is before we even talk about the cows themselves.\nHow Are Cows Treated On Dairy Farms?\nCows are treated as though they are inanimate machinery – you turn on a tap and out comes the milk.\nAs we know, cows produce milk only when they are pregnant, as their breast milk is intended for their babies. Every day that pregnancy is delayed is a day’s loss of milk, and so pregnancy is not left to chance. Cows are artificially inseminated which involves one human hand entering the cow’s anus to manipulate her cervix into position while the other hand inserts a tube of semen into her vagina. Suddenly, milk doesn’t seem quite so wholesome, does it?\nWhen the babies are born, they are taken from their mothers so they don’t actually drink the milk that was made for them. Cows show extreme distress at this separation, often bellowing with grief as any mother would. Cows have been known to break out of farms and trek for miles in search of their calves, such is the strength of their determination and love. And spare a thought for the calves themselves. Newborns need their mothers, and yet they are taken forcibly, and either killed or isolated. Their mothers can only look on and cry out for this to stop but it will happen again and again, as that is the only way to keep the milk flowing.\nIn CAFOs, cows who are naturally grazing animals and have four distinct areas of their stomachs to help them digest grass, are denied access to pasture. They are also denied stimulation, and have nothing to do all day but stand, eat and be milked. And suffer. Standing around is not pain-free when you consider the prevalence of lameness on America’s dairy farms to be up to 55 percent.\nAnd there is an immense biological price to pay for being near-constantly pregnant while simultaneously milked. No wonder, cows break down when still so very young. When they can no longer produce as much milk as is demanded of them, they are trucked to slaughter. It’s not a problem for the farmer, as there are always plenty of female calves who can take the place of their mothers, until they too collapse under the emotional, psychological and physical strain of being a dairy cow.\nIs Dairy Farming Cruel?\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer physically. As well as lameness, there is a high incidence of clinical mastitis – a painful infection of the teats usually caused by bacteria transmitted during the milking process or through living in filthy surroundings. It is so common that it occurs in all dairy herds. Mastitis is extraordinarily painful, and each day, every day, the cows’ infected teats are inserted into machinery to have the milk drawn from them.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer psychologically. Cows are intelligent, sentient beings, with individual personalities, the ability to learn and display long-term memory. They even remember those who have handled them roughly. Cows have needs and desires, but in modern intensive farms they are afforded nothing that makes their lives worthwhile.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer emotion\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems the Aztecs were highly dependent on corn (maize) as a staple food and their agricultural practices were advanced.

The term is derived from the Greek dēmokratia, which was coined from dēmos (“people”) and kratos (“rule”) in the middle of the 5th century bce to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens.\nFundamental questions\nThe etymological origins of the term democracy hint at a number of urgent problems that go far beyond semantic issues. If a government of or by the people—a “popular” government—is to be established, at least five fundamental questions must be confronted at the outset, and two more are almost certain to be posed if the democracy continues to exist for long.\n(1) What is the appropriate unit or association within which a democratic government should be established? A town or city? A country? A business corporation? A university? An international organization? All of these?\n(2) Given an appropriate association—a city, for example—who among its members should enjoy full citizenship? Which persons, in other words, should constitute the dēmos? Is every member of the association entitled to participate in governing it? Assuming that children should not be allowed to participate (as most adults would agree), should the dēmos include all adults? If it includes only a subset of the adult population, how small can the subset be before the association ceases to be a democracy and becomes something else, such as an aristocracy (government by the best, aristos) or an oligarchy (government by the few, oligos)?\n(3) Assuming a proper association and a proper dēmos, how are citizens to govern? What political organizations or institutions will they need? Will these institutions differ between different kinds of associations—for example, a small town and a large country?\n(4) When citizens are divided on an issue, as they often will be, whose views should prevail, and in what circumstances? Should a majority always prevail, or should minorities sometimes be empowered to block or overcome majority rule?\n(5) If a majority is ordinarily to prevail, what is to constitute a proper majority? A majority of all citizens? A majority of voters? Should a proper majority comprise not individual citizens but certain groups or associations of citizens, such as hereditary groups or territorial associations?\n(6) The preceding questions presuppose an adequate answer to a sixth and even more important question: Why should “the people” rule? Is democracy really better than aristocracy or monarchy? Perhaps, as Plato argues in the Republic, the best government would be led by a minority of the most highly qualified persons—an aristocracy of “philosopher-kings.” What reasons could be given to show that Plato’s view is wrong?\n- Key People:\n- Pericles\n- Aung San Suu Kyi\n- Solon\n- Cleisthenes of Athens\n- Ephialtes\n(7) No association could maintain a democratic government for very long if a majority of the dēmos—or a majority of the government—believed that some other form of government were better. Thus, a minimum condition for the continued existence of a democracy is that a substantial proportion of both the dēmos and the leadership believes that popular government is better than any feasible alternative. What conditions, in addition to this one, favour the continued existence of democracy? What conditions are harmful to it? Why have some democracies managed to endure, even through periods of severe crisis, while so many others have collapsed?\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, democracy spread primarily due to the influence of key historical events and figures, the spread of ideas through communication, and the inherent benefits of democratic systems such as the protection of individual freedoms, the avoidance of costly violence, and the ability to adapt and innovate.

This belief was prevalent among Christians for centuries.\n\n2. **Political and Economic Factors**: Throughout history, Jews were often seen as a threat to the ruling powers due to their economic influence, especially as moneylenders, which was not permissible for Christians during the medieval period.\n\n3. **Social Isolation**: The imposition of laws and restrictions on Jewish practices, such as circumcision and the prohibition of certain religious observances, led to their social isolation and discrimination.\n\n4. **Natural Disasters and Scapegoating**: During times of crises like the Black Death, Jews were frequently blamed for calamities, leading to violent persecutions and mass expulsions.\n\n5. **Cultural and Linguistic Differences**: The distinct cultural and linguistic characteristics of Jews made them easily identifiable and often targets of prejudice.\n\n6. **Systematic Policies**: In the modern era, particularly under the Nazi regime, the persecution reached unprecedented levels with the Holocaust, where six million Jews were systematically murdered.\n\nIn summary, the persecution of Jews has deep historical roots and has been influenced by a combination of religious, political, economic, and social factors. </think>\n\n<answer>Religious differences, political and economic factors, social isolation, natural disasters and scapegoating, cultural and linguistic differences, and systematic policies have all contributed to the persecution of Jews throughout history.</answer>",

The earliest major event was in 597 BCE, when the Neo-Babylonian Empire conquered the Kingdom of Judah and then persecuted and exiled its Jewish subjects. Antisemitism has been widespread across many regions of the world and practiced by many different empires, governments, and adherents of other religions.\nJews have been commonly used as scapegoats for tragedies and disasters such as in the Black Death persecutions, the 1066 Granada massacre, the Massacre of 1391 in Spain, the many pogroms in the Russian Empire, and the ideology of Nazism, which led to the Holocaust, the systematic murder of six million Jews during World War II.\nAncient history\n[edit]Neo-Babylonian Empire\n[edit]The Babylonian captivity or the Babylonian exile is the period in Jewish history during which a large number of Judeans from the ancient Kingdom of Judah were captives in Babylon, the capital city of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, following their defeat in the Jewish–Babylonian war and the destruction of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. The event is described in the Hebrew Bible, and its historicity is supported by archaeological and non-biblical evidence.\nAfter the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem, which resulted in tribute being paid by the Judean king Jehoiakim.[1] In the fourth year of Nebuchadnezzar II's reign, Jehoiakim refused to pay further tribute. This led to another siege of the city in Nebuchadnezzar II's seventh year that culminated in the death of Jehoiakim and the exile to Babylonia of his successor Jeconiah, his court and many others.[2]\nJeconiah's successor Zedekiah and others were exiled in Nebuchadnezzar II's 18th year. A later deportation occurred in Nebuchadnezzar II's 23rd year. The dates, numbers of deportations, and numbers of deportees given in the biblical accounts vary.[2] These deportations are dated to 597 BC for the first, with others dated at 587/586 BC, and 582/581 BC respectively.[3]\nSeleucid Empire\n[edit]When Judea fell under the authority of the Seleucid Empire, the process of Hellenization was enforced by law.[4] This effectively meant requiring pagan religious practice.[5][6] In 167 BC Jewish sacrifice was forbidden, sabbaths and feasts were banned and circumcision was outlawed. Altars to Greek gods were set up and animals prohibited to Jews were sacrificed on them. The Olympian Zeus was placed on the altar of the Temple. Possession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offense.\nRoman Empire\n[edit]The Jewish Encyclopaedia refers to the antisemitic persecution of Jews and the paganization of Jerusalem during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117–138 AD):\nThe Jews now passed through a period of bitter persecution: Sabbaths, festivals, the study of the Torah and circumcision were interdicted, and it seemed as if Hadrian desired to annihilate the Jewish people. His anger fell upon all the Jews of his empire, for he imposed upon them an oppressive poll-tax. The persecution, however, did not last long, for Antoninus Pius (138–161) revoked the cruel edicts.[7]\nMedieval period\n[edit]Europe\n[edit]In the Middle Ages, antisemitism in Europe was religious. Many Christians, including members of the clergy, held the Jewish people collectively responsible for the killing of Jesus. As stated in the Boston College Guide to Passion Plays, \"Over the course of time, Christians began to accept … that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ's death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or 'god-killing'. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.\"[8]\nDuring the Hi\nDoc 2(Title: \"Persecution of Jews - Wikipedia\") present at Jesus Christ's death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or 'god-killing'. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.\"[8]\nDuring the High Middle Ages in Europe, there was full-scale persecution of Jews in many places, with blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. The persecution reached its first peak during the Crusades. In the First Crusade (1096), flourishing communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed, a prime example being the Rhineland massacres.[9]\nIn the Second Crusade (1147), Jews in France were subject to frequent massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds' Crusades of 1251 and 1320. The Crusades were followed by expulsions. All English Jews were banished in 1290. 100,000 Jews were expelled from France in 1396. In 1421, thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland.[9]\nAs the Black Death epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half of the population, Jews were taken as scapegoats. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence in the Black Death persecutions. Although Pope Clement VI tried to protect them by papal bull on July 6, 1348 – with another following later in 1348 – several months afterwards, 900 Jews were burnt alive in Strasbourg, where the plague hadn't yet affected the city.[10]\nOne study finds that persecutions and expulsions of Jews increased with negative economic shocks and climatic variations in Europe during the period from 1100 to 1600.[11] The authors of the study argue that this stems from people blaming Jews for misfortunes and weak rulers going after Jewish wealth in times of fiscal crisis. The authors propose several explanations for why Jewish persecutions significantly declined after 1600:\n- 1. there were simply fewer Jewish communities to persecute by the 17th century;\n- 2. improved agricultural productivity, or, better-integrated markets may have reduced vulnerability to temperature shocks;\n- 3. the rise of stronger states may have led to more robust protection for religious and ethnic minorities;\n- 4. there were fewer negative temperature shocks.\n- 5. the impact of the Reformation and the Enlightenment may have reduced anti-semitic attitudes.[11]\nMuslim world\n[edit]According to Mark R. Cohen, during the rise of Islam, the first encounters between Muslims and Jews resulted in friendship when the people of Medina gave Muhammad refuge, among them were Jewish tribes of Medina. Conflict arose when Muhammad expelled certain Jewish tribes after they refused to swear their allegiance to him and aided Meccan pagans. He adds that this encounter was an exception rather than a rule.[12]\nOf the three Jewish tribes of Medina, the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qaynuqa were expelled in the course of Muhammad's rule after suspicion arose in the Muslim leadership that the Jews were planning the assassination of Muhammad. On the other hand, the Banu Qurayza tribe was exterminated by Muhammad in the aftermath of the Battle of the Trench. The tribe was accused of colluding with Meccan enemies during the Meccan siege of Medina and subsequently besieged. When they surrendered, all grown men were executed and women and children were enslaved.[13][14] Muhammad is recorded as saying that he would expel all Jews and Christians from Arabia,[15] although this was not carried out until the reign of Umar.[16]\nWhen Amr ibn al-As conquered Tripoli in 643, he forced the Jewish and Christian Berbers to give their wives and children as slaves to the Arab army as part of their jizya.[17][18]\nTraditionally, Jews living in Islamic states were subjected to the status of dhimmi, therefore they were allowed to practice their religion and administer their int\nDoc 3(Title: \"Roman Persecution of the Jews - Jewish Persecution\") n of synagogues in 391. Then, in 855, the Jews were exiled from Italy.\nAs one can see, the Jews had a hard time living in the Roman empire. They were constantly suppressed and persecuted by the Romans. Though the Jews tried their hardest to resist this discrimination, they always ended up on the wrong side of things due to their difference in religion or customs compared to other people. The Jews did have many difficulties living in the Roman Empire, but their people would continue to be persecuted in numerous other times, most significantly, in the Holocaust.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Persecution of Jews - The Spiritual Life\") Persecution Of Jews\nPage Contents\nPersecution of Jews has been a major part of Jewish history, prompting shifting waves of refugees throughout the diaspora communities.\nHistorically, what began as a conflict over religious beliefs evolved into a systematic policy of political, economic, and social isolation; exclusion, degradation and attempted annihilation. It did not begin in the Nazi era, nor did it end with the close of World War II. Its continuance over the millennia speaks to the power of scapegoating1 a group that is defined as the “other.”\nNeo-Babylonian Empire\nMain article: Babylonian captivity\nThe Babylonian captivity or Babylonian exile is the period in Jewish history during which a large number of Judeans from the ancient Kingdom of Judah were captives in Babylon, the capital city of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, following their defeat in the Jewish–Babylonian War and the destruction of Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. The event is described in the Hebrew Bible, and its historicity is supported by archaeological and non-biblical evidence.\nAfter the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem, which resulted in tribute being paid by the Judean king Jehoiakim. In the fourth year of Nebuchadnezzar II’s reign, Jehoiakim refused to pay further tribute, which led to another siege of the city in Nebuchadnezzar II’s seventh year that culminated in the death of Jehoiakim and the exile to Babylonia of his successor Jeconiah, his court and many others; Jeconiah’s successor Zedekiah and others were exiled in Nebuchadnezzar II’s 18th year; a later deportation occurred in Nebuchadnezzar II’s 23rd year. The dates, numbers of deportations, and numbers of deportees given in the biblical accounts vary. These deportations are dated to 597 BCE for the first, with others dated at 587/586 BCE, and 582/581 BCE respectively.\nSeleucids\nSee also: Maccabees\nWhen Judea fell under the authority of the Seleucid Empire, the process of Hellenization was enforced by law. This effectively meant requiring pagan religious practice. In 167 BCE Jewish sacrifice was forbidden, sabbaths and feasts were banned and circumcision was outlawed. Altars to Greek gods were set up and animals prohibited to Jews were sacrificed on them. The Olympian Zeus was placed on the altar of the Temple. Possession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offense.\nRoman Empire\nThe Jewish Encyclopaedia refers to persecution of Jews and paganisation of Jerusalem during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117-138 AD):\n“The Jews now passed through a period of bitter persecution: Sabbaths, festivals, the study of the Torah and circumcision were interdicted, and it seemed as if Hadrian desired to annihilate the Jewish people. His anger fell upon all the Jews of his empire, for he imposed upon them an oppressive poll-tax. The persecution, however, did not last long, for Antoninus Pius (138-161) revoked the cruel edicts.”\nWestern and Christian antisemitism\nMain articles: Christianity and antisemitism and Christianity and Judaism\nIn the Middle Ages antisemitism in Europe was religious. Although not part of Catholic dogma, many Christians, including members of the clergy, held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing Jesus. As stated in the Boston College Guide to Passion Plays, “Over the course of time, Christians began to accept … that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ’s death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or ‘god-killing’. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.”\nDuring the High Middle Ages in Europe there was full-scale persecution in many places, with blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was rel\nDoc 5(Title: \"Why Were Jews Persecuted During the Black Death? - History ...\") cal Christian persecutors who stood to gain by the pogroms. Spreading through other European countries and lasting for centuries, the various Inquisitions offer proof of systemic and “legally” sanctioned anti-Semitic activity, giving us insight into the mind of European Christians. A quotation from an article on the subject of Europeans blaming Jews is most alarming, “Tens of millions of European Christians once believed — and tens of millions of Muslims believe today — that Jews kidnap and slaughter non-Jewish children before Passover to use their blood for baking matzo.” As a quick note, the blood libel dates back to the Hellenistic Period, predating Christianity by two centuries. Another incident of an anti-Jewish European event prior to the Black Death is the Church imposed order of the enslavement of all Jews at Toledo, Spain, in 694. The inexorable will of the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages to gain converts and establish control over all European populations made Jews a natural “enemy” to the Church. Religious intolerance, being a pervasive and almost universal human trait, makes the scapegoating of Jews for the Plague and other ills as inevitable as it is wrong.\nJews have often been referred to as “moneylenders” by Christians, a pejorative term that highlights the difference between Jews, who are allowed by their religion to loan money and charge interest, and Christians that often were forbidden from engaging in the business of lending money for profit. Calling Jews “usurers” was also somewhat misleading, as the technical definition of usury means any profit derived from interest, while the commonly accepted connotation is one of excessive interest (today often called “loansharking”). Resentment against those to whom money is owed is another common human trait, regardless of who the person or persons are that are due the payments. By labeling an entire group of people with such a negatively charged accusation it became easier for European Christians to reinforce each others’ core biases. Other examples of possible violent action against someone to whom powerful people were in debt was the situation with the Knights Templar. Destroying that order and seizing their assets alleviated the enormous debts owed the order by rich and powerful Europeans, including royalty. Bizarrely, perhaps, there were indeed Christian moneylenders in Europe during the Middle Ages, and usually those Christians lending money charged a higher rate of interest than did Jews! The “differentness” of the Jews, with the aforementioned religion, customs and language, probably made it easier to focus bitterness at having to pay back loans against a readily identifiable group. The disparaging of Europe’s Jews as “moneylenders” was just plain wrong, but being wrong has never stopped people from maintaining strong opinions and prejudices!\nJealousy, envy, resentment, all worked together to create an anti-Semitic atmosphere. The much studied and demonstrable fact that Jews generally have a higher regard for education may have also contributed to at least some Jews’ apparent wealth, another source of resentment from those less well off. Jews today reflect this bias toward education as evidenced by the statistic that shows Jews have an average of 13.4 years of education compared to the runner up group, Christians, at 9.3 years of education among religious groups. A cultural drive to steer children into occupations that are likely to result in better living conditions and remuneration results in envy, when it should result in emulation. As humans seldom willingly take the blame for their own relative failures, scapegoats are searched for and virtually always “found,” whether those to blame are labeled “witches” or Jews.\nAnother major historical series of events that offer the implication of the inevitability of the blaming of the Jews for the Black Death can be found in the persecution of Jews in Europe during the period of the Crusades. During the various\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information gathered, it appears that the persecution of Jews has roots in ancient history, evolving from religious differences to more systematic policies of isolation, degradation, and attempted annihilation. Key factors include:\n\n1. **Religious Differences**: Early conflicts often stemmed from the belief that Jews were responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus, leading to deicide accusations. This belief was prevalent among Christians for centuries.\n\n2. **Political and Economic Factors**: Throughout history, Jews were often seen as a threat to the ruling powers due to their economic influence, especially as moneylenders, which was not permissible for Christians during the medieval period.\n\n3. **Social Isolation**: The imposition of laws and restrictions on Jewish practices, such as circumcision and the prohibition of certain religious observances, led to their social isolation and discrimination.\n\n4. **Natural Disasters and Scapegoating**: During times of crises like the Black Death, Jews were frequently blamed for calamities, leading to violent persecutions and mass expulsions.\n\n5. **Cultural and Linguistic Differences**: The distinct cultural and linguistic characteristics of Jews made them easily identifiable and often targets of prejudice.\n\n6. **Systematic Policies**: In the modern era, particularly under the Nazi regime, the persecution reached unprecedented levels with the Holocaust, where six million Jews were systematically murdered.\n\nIn summary, the persecution of Jews has deep historical roots and has been influenced by a combination of religious, political, economic, and social factors. </think>\n\n<answer>Religious differences, political and economic factors, social isolation, natural disasters and scapegoating, cultural and linguistic differences, and systematic policies have all contributed to the persecution of Jews throughout history.</answer>",

Why?\") Is Chiropractic Care Safe?\nIs Chiropractic Care Safe?\nChiropractic Care is an effective and safe treatment that utilizes natural and noninvasive methods to help the body alleviate pain.\nBy adjusting the spine, chiropractors safely tap into the body's nervous system to promote self-healing and the return of natural physical function and range of motion.\nUnderstanding Chiropractic Care\nChiropractic might be scary at first especially if it’s your first time. And true, it’s not going to be easy-peasy but it’s the only thing that stands between you and comfort. While others might say that it’s “chiropractic magic” it is known as Chiropractic Techniques.\nBut it’s not as simple as that because these techniques are done by specialists who have gone through training and a lot of studying to perfect the work.\nNevertheless, chiropractic care may be a well-known, non-surgical treatment, but many are still doubtful whether this is safe or not.\nOver 50% of the population of America is suffering from back pain. Most of those that are going through such an excruciating have taken physical therapy and followed doctors’ orders. Did anything happen?\nA good number of these poor individuals take medications to cure their pain, some undergo unnecessary surgeries but there are others who take the other way and visit a chiropractor instead.\nThose who have visited a chiropractor can attest that these manual adjustments helped ease their low-back pains, neck pain, headaches, digestive problems, and even their allergies.\nChiropractic Adjustment- when did it start?\nChiropractic care history can go as far as 1895. A man named Daniel David Palmer was the first to perform chiropractic adjustment on a partially-deaf janitor. This janitor worked at Palmer’s office. Lillard, the janitor, said that he moved the wrong way and he heard a “pop” in his back.\nThis caused him to lose his hearing to which Palmer offered to help on his adjustments - his bone adjustments. Palmer administered the work, working on Lillard. The next day, Lillard could already hear better.\nAll about chiropractic treatment.\nChiropractic care is meant to be a complementary treatment for individuals who are looking to discover other conservative-alternative to drugs and surgery.\nChiropractors of today's generation are often working in conjunction with primary care doctors. They also work with pain experts and surgeons to treat patients who suffer from pain.\nChiropractic treatment involves a holistic approach to wellness. The main focus of this treatment is healing the body using manual manipulation of the musculoskeletal system which is also centered on the area around the spine.\nChiropractors use a combination of massage, pressure, stretches, and different exercises in order to successfully re-align the vertebrae. This, in turn, will alleviate the pain and help give back the balance that the body needs.\nChiropractic Care Treatment - Why Is It Safe?\nUp to this day, chiropractors are still being questioned about the safety of their patients. Some are hesitant to be open up to such a practice. The issue surrounding Chiropractic specialization is an open debate for everyone.\nBut let's list the reasons why many would consider chiropractic care safe and effective.\nTheir Level Of Education.\nA Chiropractor who wants to specialize in this kind of work is like all the other medical professionals, he or she must pass a state licensing exam.\nTo even qualify to take the exam, a person should complete at least 2 years of undergraduate education and 4 years of specialization in chiropractic courses. By the end of the training, the chiropractors earn a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree.\nSome even continued to pursue a postdoctoral education in different areas which may include neurology, sports injury, nutrition, and also occupational injuries and pediatrics.\nChiropractic education is not something that you should take lightly because other than being good at what they do, they also have the brains behind i\nDoc 2(Title: \"Is Chiropractic Care Safe? | Mt.

Depending on your clinical condition, he or she can forego manipulation, and instead can recommend joint mobilization, therapeutic exercise, soft-tissue techniques, or other therapies.\nOngoing Research\nThe American Chiropractic Association believes that patients have the right to know about the health risks associated with any type of treatment, including chiropractic. Today, chiropractic researchers are involved in studying the benefits and risks of spinal adjustment in the treatment of neck and back pain through clinical trials, literature reviews and publishing papers reviewing the risks and complications of neck adjustment.\nAll available evidence demonstrates that chiropractic treatment holds an extremely small risk. The chiropractic profession takes this issue very seriously and engages in training and postgraduate education courses to recognize the risk factors in patients, and to continue rendering treatment in the most effective and responsible manner.\nReferences\n1.

New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1997, p. 230-8.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Is Chiropractic Care Safe? | Mt. Olive Chiropractic Clinic\") Chiropractic is widely recognized as one of the safest, drug-free, non-invasive therapies available for the treatment of back pain, neck pain, joint pain of the arms or legs, headaches, and other neuromusculoskeletal complaints. Although chiropractic has an excellent safety record, no health treatment is completely free of potential adverse effects.\nThe risks associated with chiropractic, however, are extremely small. Many patients feel immediate relief following chiropractic treatment, but some may sometimes experience mild soreness or aching, just as they do after some forms of exercise. Current literature shows that minor discomfort or soreness following spinal manipulation typically fades within 24 hours.\nIn addition to being a safe form of treatment, spinal manipulation is incredibly effective, getting patients back on their feet faster than traditional medical care. A March 2004 study in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics found that chiropractic care is more effective than medical care at treating chronic low-back pain in those patients who have been experiencing the symptoms for one year or less. In addition, a study published in the July 15, 2003, edition of the journal Spine found that manual manipulation provides better short-term relief of chronic spinal pain than a variety of medications.\nNeck Adjustments\nNeck pain and some types of headaches are treated through precise cervical manipulation. Cervical manipulation, often called a neck adjustment, works to improve joint mobility in the neck, restoring range of motion and reducing muscle spasm, which helps relieve pressure and tension.\nNeck manipulation is a remarkably safe procedure. While some reports have associated upper high-velocity neck manipulation with a certain kind of stroke, or vertebral artery dissection, recent evidence suggests that this type of arterial injury often takes place spontaneously, or following everyday activities such as turning the head while driving, swimming, or having a shampoo in a hair salon.\nPatients with this condition may experience neck pain and headache that leads them to seek professional care—often at the office of a doctor of chiropractic or family physician—but that care is not the cause of the injury. The best evidence indicates that the incidence of artery injuries associated with high-velocity upper neck manipulation is extremely rare – about 1 case in 5.85 million manipulations.\nTo put this risk into perspective, if you drive more than a mile to get to your chiropractic appointment, you are at greater risk of serious injury from a car accident than from your chiropractic visit.\nIt is important for patients to understand the risks associated with some of the most common treatments for neck and back pain—prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)—as these options may carry risks significantly greater than those of manipulation. According to a study from the American Journal of Gastroenterology, approximately one-third of all hospitalizations and deaths related to gastrointestinal bleeding can be attributed to the use of aspirin or NSAID painkillers like ibuprofen.\nFurthermore, surgery for conditions for which manipulation may also be used carries risks many times greater than those of chiropractic treatment. Even prolonged bed rest carries some risks, including muscle atrophy, cardiopulmonary deconditioning, bone mineral loss and thromoembolism.\nIf you are visiting your doctor of chiropractic with upper-neck pain or headache, be very specific about your symptoms. This will help your doctor of chiropractic offer the safest and most effective treatment, even if it involves referral to another health care provider. If the issue of stroke concerns you, do not hesitate to discuss it with your doctor of chiropractic.

But with their level of education and their combined years of experience, Doctors of Chiropractic definitely know what they are doing.\nThey do manual adjustments depending on what you need. There are no two patients who have the same health problem but they would receive the same chiropractic treatment.\nThis is the reason why chiropractors need to do a thorough assessment first before they can determine the type of treatment that you will go through.\nFor example, two patients are both complaining of a severe headache when they enter the chiropractors’ clinic. However, these two will not undergo the same treatment because the cause of their headaches is not relatively similar.\nThis means that the chiropractors DO NOT treat the symptoms. Rather, they go deep to the cause of the problem and start from there.\nClients’ Best Experience.\nMany athletes seek the help of Chiropractors since they are always testing their body to the limit. Individuals who play sports and who visits the gym are prone to stretching their muscles and joints which causes posture problems.\nAdvocates of chiropractic swear that these treatments help them ease their back pains and tension headaches. This also helps them relax better, improve their posture and balance, and also decrease possible inflammation of the muscles and joints.\nOthers believe that chiropractic helps alleviate their allergies and minimizes their stress levels from the central nervous system.\nYour Responsibilities Before Your First Chiropractic Visit\nJust like visiting a medical doctor, there are certain things that you should do first before your first visit to the chiropractic clinic.\nIf you feel comfortable with spinal manipulation, cracks and all, this is your go-to choice. This goes the same if you have exhausted all of your options to alleviate the discomfort that you’re feeling yet none of them are very helpful, then it's time to visit a chiropractor.\nHere are the things that you need to know to get the most out of your visits and ensure that your treatments are safe.\nLearn About Your Chiropractors Credentials.\nBefore you call to set an appointment, it is important that you check the credentials of your chiropractor first. Remember that he or she should have graduated from an accredited school.\nThese schools are usually given accreditation by the Council on Chiropractic Education or CCE. Recommendations from your medical doctor will also be helpful. Still, do a background check.\nTake Note of Your Progress.\nOne session will not be enough to treat your condition. Usually, you DC will formulate a treatment plan for you.\nTake note of your progress and show up on your scheduled appointment.\nMissing one visit can greatly affect your healing process. Your chiropractor will usually provide you with your status or how well you are after the treatments.\nDo Not Forget To Walk Around After your Treatment.\nWalking can help your joints and muscles get used to the proper alignment. Your chiropractor will show you different exercises and stretches that you can do at home to help improve your condition. Do your homework and do not just rely on your treatments.\nMany people find chiropractic treatments helpful in their lives. The treatment can help alleviate different kinds of problems that mainly involves the spine. You too may find it worth trying.\nMake sure that you follow important instructions from your chiropractor especially with home stretching and diet.

Classically trained in the European school, Picasso emerged as a symbolist, drawing on Impressionism through Munch and Post-Impressionism via Lautrec. From Cézanne and Rousseau, he learned about archaic and tribal art, which led him toward Cubism.\nPicasso strove to define his place in the history of painting from the outset of his long career. Art historians consider his late works direct dialogues with Old Masters such as Velazquez, Goya and Rembrandt. He lived most of his life in France, so Picasso knew the latest trends and schools of art. Accordingly, he studied Symbolism, which worked to build a visual language of the soul from imagery drawn from mythology and dreams. Picasso also drew on Impressionist Munch to explore the nature of souls. Clearly Lautrec influenced his palette and his choice of subjects – prostitutes and the poor – during his Blue period, so-called because of his blue and gray palette. In fact, much of Picasso’s early work experiments with color – beginning in 1897 in violet and green through the Blue and consequent Rose period and his orange and red palette. This led him to experiment with shape as well, following Cezanne – Post-Impressionism influenced by primitive art – and Rousseau – experiments in Naïve art. Picasso began to use more angular shapes and figures, as well as more color, as he worked toward founding cubism with Braque, where the artist analyzes a subject or shape, disassembles it, then reassembles it in an abstracted form. Working in cubism led Picasso to invent collage and work toward a second form of Cubism (synthetic) where artists worked in mixed media.\nDoc 2(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") ntense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art. There is no denying the power of Picasso’s creative mind, and the effects of his stylistic experimentation in Cubism shaped the artistic movements that followed him. As an artist who would come to influence so many artists himself, Picasso is a pillar in the modern art world with a fascinating life full of inspiration.\nFrom https://news.masterworksfineart.com/2019/11/28/what-was-picassos-inspiration .\n* As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\nDoc 3(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") Pablo Picasso*, born in 1881 in Malaga, Spain, and died in 1973 in Mougins, France, was an active artist for most of his long life. His father was an artist himself, was Picasso’s first and most formative art teacher. Picasso has one of the most prolific creative careers in history, and his work was not only loved by art lovers around the world, but it was also incredibly influential for artists everywhere. But what was Picasso’s inspiration? What inspired these famous works?\nPicasso went through many creative phases in his career. These phases have been labeled as “periods” and show the different styles and mediums he was experimenting with during that time in his life. Picasso's “Blue Period” started in 1901 and lasted until 1904. During this period, Picasso painted mostly in cool blue and green tones, sometimes using a warmer color to accent his works. These pieces have a melancholy about them, and are quite somber, featuring scenes of poverty and desolation. What was Picasso’s inspiration to start painting in this way? In the spring of 1901, one of Picasso’s dear friends, a painter and poet named Carlos Casagemas, committed suicide in a cafe in Paris. Picasso was deeply affected by his death, and sank into a depression that lasted several years. Picasso’s journey through his grief and depression is clearly reflected in his “Blue Period.”\nIn 1904, Picasso moved to Montmartre in Paris, and settled into the community of bohemian artists and creators there. Coming out of his depression over his friend’s death, Picasso moved on from dark and serious subjects in his paintings to more lighthearted compositions featuring harlequins, clowns and carnival performers. His color palette warmed up as well, with his paintings now bathed in reds, oranges, pinks and earth tones. This period would be known as Picasso's “Rose Period” and it lasted until 1906. So what can be credited with this major shift in his work? Picasso met a woman named Fernande Olivier in 1904 and they began a relationship that lasted seven years. Olivier would be the first of a long line of women who were muses and lovers to Picasso over the years. This relationship and the end of his bout of depression signaled a more positive phase of Picasso’s life. The overall tone of his work during this period is much more carefree and less somber.\nCiting beautiful women as inspiration would become a theme in Picasso’s life, all the way up until his death. Picasso has been quoted saying: “For me there are only two kinds of women, goddesses and doormats.” He often became obsessed with a young woman and she became an artistic muse for him, inspiring many works. All of the women Picasso took as either wives or lovers were painted by the artist. His second wife Jacqueline Roque was the subject of over 400 portraits by Picasso, and was a great source of inspiration to him.\nFrom 1906-1909 Picasso was heavily inspired by African art, after he was exposed to traditional African masks and other art objects coming from Africa into French museums in Paris. This phase has been called his “African Period,” and was a precursor to his most famous period, “Cubism.” Influenced by Paul Cezanne’s experimentation with three-dimensional spacing and perspective, Picasso and Georges Braque pioneered the artistic movement known as Cubism. This way of breaking down a form to its most basic forms and reconstructing them in an abstracted way is what Picasso is most known for.\nSo what can we say was Picasso's inspiration?\nThroughout his life, Picasso's inspiration came in many different forms. Whether it be working through his emotions, responding to a difficult life event, meeting a beautiful young woman, an intense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art.

Then, when I ask them to engage through the roles that they play in their professional life, they are willing to engage in another school.\nHow we choose or select our own identity influences what we’re willing to engage with and how we engage. We really need to be cognizant of how we’re asking people to engage and through which lenses they are seeing the world, both in the current system and what the system could look like in the future.\nI think that’s particularly relevant with parents because they grew up in the same system. There’s no reason why they should suddenly be able to reimagine the system today. We have to do it as a collective effort and a collective narrative. I recognize that’s not a concrete idea, but I think we make assumptions that people are going to imagine something different from what they experienced.\nIt’s why I work with artists so much. They get us out of our boxes and open us up to permeate the disciplines and other ways of creative thinking that our experience in the education system can sometimes limit us from accessing.\nQ. What would you tell people who are doing the work of leveraging community assets from a learner-centered perspective?\nTimothy Jones: Don’t worry about the pace of the change at the onset. You never get to fully understand the impact when you first start out. As much as you can, document and allow recipients of services to tell their story. There’s so much going on that it can almost paralyze you and make you feel powerless. But, you’ll see more possibilities if you change that perspective to, “There’s so much going on, that, if I just try my best, I’m going to find a way to make an impact.”\nJosh Schachter: In our culture and society, we talk about innovation a lot. Everyone wants to be an innovator and, as someone that was an educator, that’s now running a tech-focused nonprofit, I’ve come to realize that most innovation involves failure, humility, and iteration.\nWe have to embrace it. If we’re not willing to be learners in this process, listen to what we’ve learned, and adapt, then we’re not going to be able to get out of the current situation. We’re not going to get it right the first or second time, but maybe that’s the point. Isn’t that the point of learning?\nIt’s the journey of learning that creates the desire to learn. I think we need to have the humility to remember that is going to be central to whatever we’re going to create, and resist the pressure of funders and others who want us to present the outcomes and the outputs before we even start the process. That type of thinking probably isn’t going to get us where we need to go because we may not know exactly where we’re headed.\nI think there are bright spots that we can learn from, and we need to highlight those bright spots and share the lessons learned across our networks.\nJoe Hobot: I’m drawing from my experience as an Indigenous man within an Indigenous community, who’s had its youth be forced under subjugated protocols of a dominant culture until we reached an existential crisis with our language, our customs, and the corrosive effect education is having.\nMy advice, and what I’ve learned, is to be bold. The best examples of educational practices that have been working; they just dreamed it up and did it. After about two decades of protracted investigation and research into public education reform, and the academic achievements of the various communities of color within this country, we’ve come to understand that we’re in this “emperor has no clothes” moment.\nIt’s time to shed that fear that you’re going to need to have official approval of the systems in place and just do it.

But he adds this condition, “When done properly.”\nMost drawbacks to regionalism, Walker said, are connected to how a regional initiative is executed.\n“For example, the effort must be fair and inclusive, involving the proper people. It must also honor each of the partner communities’ own identity and branding efforts and find a common message that doesn’t compete with any of those brands.”\nYou’ve got to be able to compete\nWhen business and community leaders talk about the benefits of regionalism, they mention being able to compete with other regions of the country for business and industry, they cite more efficient use of tax dollars and better opportunities to solve problems.\n“Regionalism encourages cooperation and partnerships, while making possible feats that ordinarily might not be attainable and creates opportunities that may not otherwise be available,” said Steve Smith, president and CEO of Food City. “There are very few, if any, drawbacks to regionalism, when implemented properly.”\nKen Maness points out that the region has undertaken significant joint projects in the past, most notably the creation of Tri-Cities Airport, and more recently, banding together to support the creation of Ballad Health.\n“Regionalism in our area has been around for a long time. We will benefit as it strengthens,” said Maness, a former Kingsport alderman who now serves on the Tri-Cities Airport Authority. “The path to regionalism is easier when a strong common bond and clear regional identity exists. In the Tri Cities, we have a bond based on proximity to each other, creating economic interdependence, while facing challenges as remote outposts to our state governments.”\nJerry Caldwell, Bristol Motor Speedway executive vice president and general manager, said his organization sees firsthand the “amazing things” that can be accomplished when the region pulls together.\n“We at Bristol Motor Speedway are very fortunate to be an international destination and have very strong support from everyone in this region. We are not able to put on the events that we host without that support of everyone in the region,” he said.\nOn the national stage\nBeing nationally recognized as one large community “much like the Research Triangle in North Carolina or Silicon Valley in California” is another big benefit of regionalism, according to Miles Burdine and Bob Feathers of the Kingsport Chamber of Commerce. Burdine is the chamber’s president and Feathers is chamber board chair. They responded together to the newspaper’s questions.\n“It puts our regional community on the map so everyone will know where we are and, in many ways, who and what we are,” they said.\nRegionalism is also the acceptance of a hard truth, according to Jon Smith, Tri-Cities Airport Authority chairman and East Tennessee State University director of the Bureau of Business & Economics Research.\n“When it comes to attracting industry, smaller urban centers are at a significant disadvantage when competing against larger cities,” he said.\nFor cities and counties in smaller regions to compete with larger communities, they have to work together, Smith said.\n“It is the surest way of achieving regionwide economic growth that will increase the prosperity of the region’s residents and achieve economic development that will enhance our quality of life while preserving the amenities and culture that make the region unique.”\nIdentity crisis\nThe drawback to regionalism most voiced addressed a community’s fear of losing its unique identity, its “sense of place, sense of community,” said Margaret Feierabend, Bristol, Tenn., mayor.\nBristol Chamber of Commerce President Beth Rhinehart said, “There is an innate fear for some that regionalism means our own community’s identity and interests will no longer matter.”\nSome people worry that regionalism means giving up local political control o\nDoc 2(Title: \"What are the benefits of regionalism and what are the drawbacks ...\") garet Feierabend, Bristol, Tenn., mayor.\nBristol Chamber of Commerce President Beth Rhinehart said, “There is an innate fear for some that regionalism means our own community’s identity and interests will no longer matter.”\nSome people worry that regionalism means giving up local political control or “letting another community win,” said Alan Levine, CEO of Ballad Health.\n“It does not. What it does mean is that our regional industrial and commercial growth is critical for us to have strong local political leadership,” he said.\n“In many respects, our political leaders struggle with regionalism because they are elected to serve the needs of county and city taxpayers, and that is totally reasonable. That’s why the business community, which does not have those political boundaries, has to lead this effort.”\nAnd Johnson City Vice Mayor Jenny Brock said regionalism is not a threat to a city’s or county’s unique identity.\n“I see just the opposite.

Cows in today’s dairy industry are given utmost veterinary care in order to ensure that they are free from any illness. It is also important to monitor their health in order to ensure that the illness isn’t going to spread into the entire herd. Vaccination and proper monitoring are just some of the most important practices in today’s modern dairy industry.\nFor instance, it is important that the sick cow is going to show no trace of antibiotics in her milk. Milk with traces of antibiotics is not allowed to be sold in the market today.\nThere are basically a lot of new innovations and technologies in today’s dairy industry. The industry now has a better understanding of exactly how to meet the demands of their consumers. Even though only 2% of the entire population works in dairy farms, they are still able to cater to the world’s demand for dairy-related products. Thanks to modern day practices from the industry, consumers are also safer when they consume their dairy products.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Dairy Farming: What Is It? And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") lly damaging industry, and aside from the fact it makes so many people who consume it sick, dairying affects people in another important way. When we overproduce milk we are being recklessly wasteful of land, water, feed and farmers’ time. Wouldn’t these vital resources be better used in the production of nutritious plant-based foods that are sustainable and essential for optimal health?\nInstead of situating these damaging animal-based industries among poor, underserved communities, often predominantly inhabited by people of color, wouldn’t it be better to grow healthful plant foods that can be made locally available? ‘Food deserts’ is a term commonly used for areas where affordable, healthful food is in short supply, but food justice activists instead talk about ‘food apartheid’, as this issue connects directly to a systemic racism inherent in the food system.\nThere is much that is damaging about the dairy industry, and that is before we even talk about the cows themselves.\nHow Are Cows Treated On Dairy Farms?\nCows are treated as though they are inanimate machinery – you turn on a tap and out comes the milk.\nAs we know, cows produce milk only when they are pregnant, as their breast milk is intended for their babies. Every day that pregnancy is delayed is a day’s loss of milk, and so pregnancy is not left to chance. Cows are artificially inseminated which involves one human hand entering the cow’s anus to manipulate her cervix into position while the other hand inserts a tube of semen into her vagina. Suddenly, milk doesn’t seem quite so wholesome, does it?\nWhen the babies are born, they are taken from their mothers so they don’t actually drink the milk that was made for them. Cows show extreme distress at this separation, often bellowing with grief as any mother would. Cows have been known to break out of farms and trek for miles in search of their calves, such is the strength of their determination and love. And spare a thought for the calves themselves. Newborns need their mothers, and yet they are taken forcibly, and either killed or isolated. Their mothers can only look on and cry out for this to stop but it will happen again and again, as that is the only way to keep the milk flowing.\nIn CAFOs, cows who are naturally grazing animals and have four distinct areas of their stomachs to help them digest grass, are denied access to pasture. They are also denied stimulation, and have nothing to do all day but stand, eat and be milked. And suffer. Standing around is not pain-free when you consider the prevalence of lameness on America’s dairy farms to be up to 55 percent.\nAnd there is an immense biological price to pay for being near-constantly pregnant while simultaneously milked. No wonder, cows break down when still so very young. When they can no longer produce as much milk as is demanded of them, they are trucked to slaughter. It’s not a problem for the farmer, as there are always plenty of female calves who can take the place of their mothers, until they too collapse under the emotional, psychological and physical strain of being a dairy cow.\nIs Dairy Farming Cruel?\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer physically. As well as lameness, there is a high incidence of clinical mastitis – a painful infection of the teats usually caused by bacteria transmitted during the milking process or through living in filthy surroundings. It is so common that it occurs in all dairy herds. Mastitis is extraordinarily painful, and each day, every day, the cows’ infected teats are inserted into machinery to have the milk drawn from them.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer psychologically. Cows are intelligent, sentient beings, with individual personalities, the ability to learn and display long-term memory. They even remember those who have handled them roughly. Cows have needs and desires, but in modern intensive farms they are afforded nothing that makes their lives worthwhile.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer emotion\nDoc 3(Title: \"How does the modern dairy industry work? - Best in Australia\") There are a lot of things that have changed in the dairy industry today. For instance, during the 1800s, there were several issues found in milk. Poor sanitation and our poor understanding of microorganisms have caused several milk-borne diseases to become rampant. In 1862, French scientist Louis Pasteur showed a method that could eliminate the risk. Later known as pasteurisation, it has changed the way the industry operates.\nAlso, in 1890, Henry Coit together with other physicians established The Medical Milk Commission that certified the overall safety of consumer milk. By the time when industrial agriculture evolved, the operations of the dairy industry also changed significantly as huge operations became dominant.\nModern day practices in today’s dairy industry\nFrom the 1800s to today, things have changed significantly for the dairy industry. There are modern-day practices that can be considered a huge leap from the old dairy practices.\nSelective breeding\nThough considered to be a highly controversial topic, there are dairies that have practiced selective breeding among cows in order to get the shape of the leg that they need. In some cases, it also led to better production of milk.\nArtificial insemination\nAnother practice in today’s dairy industry is artificial insemination. It is today’s most common method of reproductive management in different parts of the world. In 1996, it was reported in the US that 45% of dairy operations have already used artificial insemination over having a breeding bull.\nThis has improved milk production and has resulted in the desired cattle by most farms. It also led to genetically elite sires and an increased conception rate. Conception rate among dairies that have practiced artificial insemination is at around more or less 40%.\nHigh standards for milk\nUnlike the old times when people get sick when they drink milk, the industry now has a high standard when it comes to the quality of milk that they allow in the market.\nMilk quality is synonymous with the somatic cell count (SCC) as well as bacterial count coming from the pre-pasteurised bulk tank milk. Different countries have set different allowable maximum somatic cell counts. In the US, the upper limit for SCC is at 750,000 cells per 1ML whereas it is 500,000 cells/ML for Canada.\nRapid advancement in nutrition\nNutrition has also advanced in today’s dairy processes. For instance, when it comes to lactating cows, they are fed with component-based ration or total mixed ration. The content of the ration is based on research as well as laboratory testing. For dairy nutritionists, a good combination of hay, grains, and protein sources in cows are important.\nWhen it comes to the diet of most cows, it usually depends on the surplus items in the area. For Florida, for instance, a good amount of citrus pulp and brewer’s mash has been incorporated in cow feed mainly because of the orange production in the state. It becomes a nutritious diet for cows instead of ending up as landfill.\nWater is also another important component of a cow’s diet. Farmers today ensure that their cows get access to clean water all the time given the fact that these animals can consume approximately around 95 to 190 litres of water daily.\nFree range vs. small spaces\nUnfortunately, there are a good number of farms that have confined their animals in small spaces. On the other hand, there are those farms that have reverted towards free-range practices wherein cows are free to roam and eat grass.\nPart of the reason why free-range cows are becoming popular is the fact that cows that roam freely require less medical attention than cows found in “animal factories”. Those cows that are placed in small spaces usually take antibiotics not only to grow faster but to compensate for their living conditions.\nHealthcare\nFarms now pay close attention to the overall health of their cows. Cows in today’s dairy industry are given utmost veterinary care in order to ensure that they are free from\nDoc 4(Title: \"Dairy Farming: The Truth About Consuming Milk and Cheese\") News\nWalmart Looks to Tighten Its Grip On Beef Supply Chain\nFood•9 min read\nExplainer\nDairy farming is the practice of raising animals such as cows, goats and buffalo to produce milk for human consumption.\nWords by Grace Hussain\nThe dairy industry has worked hard over the years to portray a positive image to consumers. The ads associated with the 1990s-era Got Milk campaign had everyone from Angelina Jolie to Shaquille O’Neal sporting a milk mustache. More recently, the industry has infiltrated virtually every corner of social media through partnerships with influencers as part of their #undeniablydairy campaign. Yet contrary to what the industry’s popular campaigns would have you believe, dairy farms pollute the environment and are fraught with animal welfare issues.\nDairy farming consists of raising mother animals and collecting the milk that they produce after giving birth. Though cows are the most commonly farmed animal within the dairy industry, there are other animals that are also raised for their milk. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, cattle produce 81 percent of milk, buffalo produce 15 percent, goats 2 percent, sheep 1 percent, and camels 0.5 percent.\nThe milk that is gathered from the mother animals is either bottled to be sold to consumers or used to create other drinks and food items such as cheese and yogurt.\nCows are the main animal raised to produce milk. However, there are a number of other animals raised for milk production. The dairy herd in India, the top producer of dairy in the world, is half made up of buffalo.\nThe milk produced on dairy farms goes on to be used in several different ways, including to create cheeses, yogurts, chocolate and a number of other popular processed foods.\nIndustrialized dairy farming, which is the dominant way of raising dairy cows around the world, uses intensive methods. Intensive farming means increasing the resources used in the production process in order to increase productivity, rather than simply extending the farm over a larger area. An example within dairy farming is the use of antibiotics to prevent disease, instead of simply to treat an animal that falls sick. The food that is grown for dairy cows to consume is also an example of intensive farming, since large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers are used to grow most farmed animal feed.\nThere is an entire academic discipline, dairy science, dedicated to increasing efficiency within the dairy industry, with degree programs at universities across the U.S. and around the world.\nAs time has passed, dairy farming has moved away from the idyllic image of a farmer with a piece of straw hanging out of their mouth squeezing streams of milk from a cow’s udder into a dented metal bucket. The techniques employed today use cutting-edge technology and require significant investment.\nA milking pipeline is a feature common in medium-sized dairies. The system consists of parts that attach to each teat of a cow and a pipeline that runs the milk directly into a refrigerated storage tank.\nMilking parlors are the part of a dairy farm in which cows are actually milked. There are different types of parlors that allow cows to come and go, but many dairy cattle are still housed in tie stalls, in which they are tied into the same small stall for the entire time that they are being milked, with workers walking from cow to cow.\nWhen to stop milking an individual cow can be difficult to determine. Automatic take-offs sense when milk flow has reduced and automatically detach from the cow.\nFully automated milking systems allow cows to enter the milking parlor when they are ready to be milked. They are encouraged to enter the parlor with treats at every milking and are outfitted with a special collar that records the last time they were milked to prevent them from going in too soon.\nDairy products can be found gracing tables around the world, but the consequences of dairy farming often go unnoticed.

They even remember those who have handled them roughly. Cows have needs and desires, but in modern intensive farms they are afforded nothing that makes their lives worthwhile.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer emotionally. Is there anything more cruel than forcing someone to be pregnant then stealing away the baby so you can harvest their milk? When put in simple terms, dairy production sounds like something out of The Handmaid’s Tale.\nDairy farming must rank among the cruelest industries on the planet.\nDairy Farming Facts\nHere are ten things you may not know about the dairy industry.\n- The veal industry is inextricably tied to the dairy industry. If you hate the thought of a baby animal being confined, chained, deliberately kept weak and anemic and slaughtered young, it’s not enough to boycott veal. You need to boycott milk, too.\n- In some states it is still legal to remove the tails of dairy cows. A survey of 113 North Central and North Eastern US dairies found that tail docking was practiced at 82.3 percent of the dairies.\n- Tie stalls – where cows may be tethered continuously – are the primary form of housing on 39 percent and 75 percent of US and Canadian dairy farms, respectively.\n- The hairs around cows’ udders may be burned off using a propane torch. The industry admits that some cows ‘react’ to this shocking procedure.\n- Dairy farmers in the US can still use the growth hormone bovine somatotropin (bST) to boost milk yields. It also increases the risk of mastitis, lameness, indigestion and diarrhoea in cows, and is banned in the EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Argentina.\n- Journey times for US dairy cows being taken to slaughter can be up to 28 punishing hours without rest.\n- When a cow is suffering from mastitis, neutrophils end up in the milk – these are the inflammatory immune cells that cause pus. In the European Union, the legal limit is set at 300,000 cells per ml of milk. In the United States, it is more than double at 750,000 cells per ml. But how much pus in your latte is too much?\n- Antibiotics and pesticides are also ‘prevalent’ in retail cows’ milk. As is pus.\n- Gastroenterologist Dr. Angie Sadeghi says that milk is ‘such poison to our gut’.\n- Oxford University researchers found that the most sustainable dairy milk was still worse for the planet than the least sustainable plant milks. Their advice? Choose plant milks.\nConclusion\nThere can be no more ruthless industry than the dairy industry. Animals are exploited for their reproductive capabilities, and their young are simply disposed of. It’s an industry that trashes the environment, causes immense suffering to gentle, sentient beings, and makes people sick.\nNo wonder, sales of milk are declining as people abandon this cruel, damaging ‘poison’, and choose plant milks instead.\nFind out more about making healthy, compassionate food choices by trying vegan for 7 or 30 days HERE.\nAre plant milks expensive where you live?

Air pollution can be measured in various ways, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). Major industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and natural factors all contribute to air quality. </think>\n\n<search> trends in air pollution over time </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Over the Last 43 Years Here's How Much Pollution We've Put Into the Air\") Over the Last 43 Years, Here's How Much Pollution We've Put Into the Air\nWhile pollution and its effect on climate change may be international problems, not all countries are equally at fault.\nDespite the changing international landscape and the rise of powerful industrial economies such in India and Russia, nearly half of the world's CO2 emissions can be squarely blamed on two countries: the U.S. and China.\nThe latter firmly cemented its leading status in 2007, although the U.S. emission levels are not looking any lower. Here is a map illustrating just how much CO2 emission these two countries dump on the rest of the world:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nCarbon emissions have been on the rise since 1971, with a steady annual increase of 2%. The global output is expected to rise by another 39% by 2030. In the U.S. alone, CO2 emissions have increased by 10% between 1999 and 2011.\nHow does that look compared to the rest of the world? Surprisingly enough, the global landscape of carbon emission has not changed much over the years. Here's a GIF simulating CO2 output in 1971:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nMost of the carbon emissions are concentrated in North America, Europe and East Asia, with the only noticeable outlier being South Africa.\nNow here is a version that illustrates how the carbon outputs look in 2011:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nThe most obvious increase is in China, which is covered by the CO2 clouds. Other countries that increased their presence on the map include Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India and Australia, while western Europe significantly cut down its output. But other than a few noticeable additions and eliminations, the distribution of carbon emission across the world looks remarkably similar to how it did back in 1971.\nIn pie chart form, it becomes even more telling just how much impact the U.S. and China's CO2 dump has on the rest of the world:\nImage Credit: EPA\nIn 2008, U.S. CO2 output was equal to India and 24 EU countries' combined output. As for China, it emitted as much CO2 as the U.S. and Japan combined.\nChina has been under a ton of pressure to deal with its insane air pollution problem, and it looks like its emissions may finally be slowing down. It's also drafting a comprehensive climate change bill to reform its energy policy. Chinese officials are considering a carbon tax, and by 2040, they want to reduce CO2 output by 40% of the 2005 levels.\nBut no matter how many doomsday scenarios are foretold, the U.S. remains frustratingly slow on curbing down carbon emission. Despite improved energy efficiency and increased popularity of alternative energy sources, the U.S. ended its recent CO2 decline streak with a 2% increase in 2013. But what can you expect from a country where politicians want to censor science and stop students from learning about climate change?\nDoc 2(Title: \"Air Pollution - Our World in Data\") across all countries of the world but with large differences in severity.\nIn the interactive map, we show death rates from air pollution across the world, measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 people in a given country or region.\nThe burden of air pollution tends to be greater across both low and middle-income countries for two reasons: indoor pollution rates tend to be high in low-income countries due to a reliance on solid fuels for cooking, and outdoor air pollution tends to increase as countries industrialize and shift from low to middle incomes.\nA map of the number of deaths from air pollution by country can be found here.\nHow are death rates from air pollution changing?\nDeath rates from air pollution are falling – mainly due to improvements in indoor pollution\nIn the visualization, we show global death rates from air pollution over time – shown as the total air pollution – in addition to the individual contributions from outdoor and indoor pollution.\nGlobally, we see that in recent decades, the death rates from total air pollution have declined: since 1990, death rates have nearly halved. But, as we see from the breakdown, this decline has been primarily driven by improvements in indoor air pollution.\nDeath rates from indoor air pollution have seen an impressive decline, while improvements in outdoor pollution have been much more modest.\nYou can explore this data for any country or region using the \"change country\" toggle on the interactive chart.\nKey Charts on Air Pollution\nSee all charts on this topicEndnotes\nMurray, C.

By extracting layers of ice which have accumulated in Greenland over many millennia and analysing the methane trapped within them, scientists have been able to link increased levels with activity we know civilisations such as the Ancient Romans and the Han Dynasty in China were undertaking at the time.\nDespite humans being aware of pollution for many decades (and having caused it for many more), our knowledge has grown exponentially over the last 50 years. So too have the efforts to reverse the trend by environmental groups, scientists, Governments and world leaders. Since Filtermist first began producing oil mist filters to help workplaces reduce their emissions in 1969, we have seen huge developments – but there are still regions of the world where pollution levels are increasing far above those acceptable as set down by legislation, and there are still individuals and employers who don’t comprehend the full scale of the problem and the negative impacts of pollutants like oil mist and dust.\nAir pollution is defined as a ‘mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both inside and outside’ – excess pollution has an impact on the environment (including contributing to rising temperatures across the globe) and humans too: through diseases caused by poor air quality. Hundreds of thousands of deaths each year are attributed to pollutants.\nIn this guide, we take a look at how emission levels, our knowledge and the regulations have changed in the past 50 years since Filtermist launched – and what could happen in the future if they are not reversed.\nEmissions over the years:\nThere are many different substances which class as air pollution when released into the atmosphere, including carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter (PM). The latter has been the primary concern of Filtermist since its inception 50 years ago, given this category includes oil mist particles which can be emitted as a by-product of various metal machining processes across multiple industries. PM can be divided into categories depending on the size of each individual particle: PM10 comprises of particles less than 10µm which can enter the lungs when inhaled, while PM2.5 can permeate the gas-exchange regions of the lungs and enter into the blood stream.\nSince the 1970s, the majority of countries have seen a decline in exposure to PM2.5, at least partially thanks to stricter regulations. But countries including India, China and Greece have all seen an increase3. In the UK, emissions have dropped significantly from 639,000 tonnes of PM10 and 498,000 tonnes of PM2.5 each year to 169,000 and 106,000 respectively.\nIn America, fewer than 20 per cent of city residents are exposed to PM10 and PM2.5 levels above the WHO Air Quality Guidelines. In higher-income countries in Europe, more than 60 per cent are exposed to higher levels, rising to more than 90 per cent when we look at lower- and middle-income European countries. However, the situation is worse in the Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, South-East Asia, and lower- and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific where between 95 and 100 per cent of cities are exposed to these above-guideline levels.\nIt’s not just a minor problem either, some of the cities are exposed to levels between six and ten times what the guidelines advise is acceptable.\nLevels have undoubtedly risen over the past 50 years, even when comparing data from a much shorter period (2008 to 2013) there is an eight per cent rise in annual mean concentrations of PM2.5. While high-income regions have seen a decrease, there has been a marked increase in pollution levels in low and medium-income regions.\nRegulations:\nDoc 4(Title: \"Air Pollution - Our World in Data\") Air Pollution\nOur overview of indoor and outdoor air pollution.\nThis article was first published in October 2017.

This chart shows the global total but can be explored for any country or region using the \"change country\" toggle.\nAir pollution is one of the leading risk factors for death. In low-income countries, it is often very near the top of the list (or is the leading risk factor).\nAir pollution contributes to one in ten deaths globally\nIn recent years, air pollution has contributed to one in ten deaths globally.2\nIn the map shown here, we see the share of deaths attributed to air pollution across the world.\nAir pollution is one of the leading risk factors for disease burden\nAir pollution is one of the leading risk factors for death. But its impacts go even further; it is also one of the main contributors to the global disease burden.\nGlobal disease burden takes into account not only years of life lost to early death but also the number of years lived in poor health.\nIn the visualization, we see risk factors ranked in order of DALYs – disability-adjusted life years – the metric used to assess disease burden. Again, air pollution is near the top of the list, making it one of the leading risk factors for poor health across the world.\nAir pollution not only takes years from people's lives but also has a large effect on the quality of life while they're still living.\nWho is most affected by air pollution?\nDeath rates from air pollution are highest in low-to-middle-income countries\nAir pollution is a health and environmental issue across all countries of the world but with large differences in severity.\nIn the interactive map, we show death rates from air pollution across the world, measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 people in a given country or region.\nThe burden of air pollution tends to be greater across both lo\nDoc 5(Title: \"Air pollution over the last 50 years - Filtermist\") impact of occupational exposure to pollutants (including oil mist, dust and fume) on the rates of diagnosis.\nThe number of people diagnosed with COPD globally rose by 44.2 per cent between 1990 and 2015 and experts predict this rate will continue to rise over the next 50 years too, given there is no known cure. In fact, it’s predicted by 2030 the condition will be the third leading cause of death worldwide, outranked only by ischaemic heart disease and strokes.\nIn previous decades, not enough was known about the links between air pollution and morbidity, but new research takes into account the fact that pollutants cause cardiovascular problems as well as respiratory issues. This means experts now estimate 800,000 deaths are caused by pollutants each year in Europe alone.\nThe Future:\nThere has been a wealth of new legislation and guidance introduced in the last 50 years, and experts have amassed extensive further knowledge about the scale of the problem of air pollution. This can only be good news as the more we know, the more everyone is able to work to tackle the issue – from Governments joining together to issue global protocols, to individual business owners fitting oil mist and dust extraction units to their machinery to safeguard their employees’ future health.\nAnd yet as we look forward to the next 50 years, it’s clear much more needs to be done to slow down the amount of pollutants we breathe day in, day out, inside and outdoors.\nIf we don’t take action, it’s expected 3.6 million people a year will die as a result of PM emissions by 2050. By the end of the century, the world is predicted to be at least four degrees warmer than it was pre-industrialisation – and that trend will only continue if we don’t curb the amount of air pollution humans are producing, and are exposed to.\nReferences available on request.\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information gathered:\n\n1. Air pollution has been a concern for at least 2,100 years, with significant increases linked to human activities such as the Ancient Romans and the Han Dynasty.\n2.

Its evolution into a feature film and many revivals emerged to become a reflection of African-American culture. As this franchise gets revisited during tonight's \"The Wiz Live!\" special on NBC, it would behoove us to recognize its contributions to entertainment and the influence of black performance art on pop culture 40 years later.\nThe tale of how 'The Wiz' went from an ambitious idea to almost not happening to becoming a seven Tony Award-winning Broadway hit is a microcosm of the perseverance of black people dreams in America. The brainchild of former disc jockey Ken Harper, The Wiz aimed to remix “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” from traditional Broadway play to a live stage performance with a Motown feel. In his presentation to Fox, Harper exhibited the foresight to promote the appeal that a musical inspired by black performing art could succeed in theaters across the country.\nIn a 1975 interview with Playbill, he recounted his sales pitch to Fox, saying \"You pick up Billboard or Cashbox\" any week, and what you’ll find is that five of the Top Ten songs on the charts are black. The message was clear. In this country, at this time, a certain kind of black music, the 'Motown Sound' sells, and it sells to everyone, black and white.\"\nThe show opened on October 21, 1974 at the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre in Baltimore and debuted on Broadway on January 5th, 1975. Despite a opening night fraught with technical issues and suggestions to quit while they were ahead, \"The Wiz, The Super Soul Musical 'Wonderful Wizard of Oz\"' received standing ovations and curtain calls. Mixed reviews be damned, Fox continued to support financially. Harper and his team utilized the funds to assemble a media blitz, trading airtime on radio for free tickets to shows and conducting as many interviews with the cast as possible.\nThe most fruitful promotion strategy for The Wiz emerged as a television ad of the cast reenacting the Yellow Brick Road scene, singing the paramount theme song “Ease On Down The Road”. Before long, the show would receive critical and commercial praise, resulting in seven Tony award wins in 1975, including “Best Musical.”\nThree years later brought the film adaptation, which wasn’t without its share of controversy. Stephanie Mills, the lead on Broadway was tapped to reprise her role as Dorothy, but a last minute power play from Diana Ross had her inserted into the role.\nAlthough the movie received critical disdain, it did not prevent it from attaining cult classic status. The Broadway production amassed a collection of talented individuals who, when given the platform, could deliver excellent performances. Although young and relative unknowns like Stephanie Mills (16, Dorothy) and Hinton Battle (18, Scarecrow) led the cast, they proved to be excellent options.\nThis cast also made history as George Faison became the first African-American choreographer to win a Tony. Also of note, the cast had familiar names as extras, most notable Phylicia Rashad (née Ayers-Allen). The film version of 'The Wiz' formed a mosaic of black excellence prevalent in 1978 and beyond. The ensemble included Diana Ross, Nipsey Russell, Mabel King, Richard Pryor, Lena Horne, and a young up and coming musician named Michael Jackson.\nUnlike films where popular actors are cast in films hoping that name recognition will translate to commercial success, The Wiz concocted a harmonious mix of talent greater than the sum of its parts. For anyone watching in 2015, the familiar faces resonate based upon more recent accomplishments.\nFans of “The Cosby Show,” “A Different World,” comedy and Michael Jackson/Jackson 5 music will embrace any of these characters with a breath of familiarity reserved when reminiscing on fond memories of friends or relatives. Prominent African-American actors whom you can identify with throughout your life. This cast had established icons and future legends, who would be cemented in black cult\nDoc 3(Title: \"How 40 years ago ‘The Wiz’ forever changed black culture ...\") By Gerrick D. Kennedy / Los Angeles Times Forty years after its original release, no film has uniquely defined black culture and shaped the framework of a musical genre quite like “The Wiz.”\nAn adaptation of the groundbreaking Broadway musical — itself a retelling of L. Frank Baum’s classic 1900 children’s fantasy “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” that became the beloved Judy Garland movie — the Sidney Lumet-directed film had a rapturous soundtrack produced by Quincy Jones, a cast that included Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne, Nipsey Russell, Mabel King and Richard Pryor and an aesthetic firmly rooted in black culture.\nFor a generation of black Americans, this was the first time they saw people who spoke, sung and moved the way they did in a Broadway production and, later, a big-screen musical, and it has become a kind of rite of passage for the black community.\nEveryone remembers their first time experiencing “The Wiz.” If it’s the stage production, that likely came from performing it in high school or seeing a touring troupe tackle it, but the film is the most accessible entry into the all-black retelling of “The Wizard of Oz.” Many of us recall watching it with family during the holidays, huddled around the TV singing the tunes.\nWhat was revolutionary about it, first in the original Broadway production and then amplified by Jones’ work on the splashy film version, was its songbook.\n“Grease” had arrived to big screens months earlier, as did “Thank God It’s Friday” (which, like “The Wiz,” was a Motown production), but both pulled from the world of disco and were tailored toward white audiences.\n“The Wiz,” however, weaved together gospel, blues, soul and R&B — genres that are unequivocally black creations — and were narratives of the black experience, an especially bold move given Hollywood’s monochromatic palette.\nIt bombed upon its release on Oct. 24, 1978 (it cost more than it earned, and critics dismissed it as a saccharine imitation of its stage predecessor), but that didn’t matter to audience members who were seeing themselves reflected on screen in ways they hadn’t before.\nHow it all started\nTo understand its power, let’s rewind to 1972. It was then that New York disc jockey Ken Harper, inspired by the dominance of the Motown sound, imagined a take of Baum’s epic fantasy that distilled the tale through a black lens.\nHe got the backing of Fox — in exchange for first option for film rights, publishing rights and album rights — and in 1974 “The Wiz: The Super Soul Musical ‘Wonderful Wizard of Oz’ ” opened in Baltimore, before hitting Broadway the following year.\n“The Wiz” weathered a ballooning budget, mixed reviews, technical hiccups, sluggish ticket sales and the constant threat of closure to become a sensation that earned seven Tony Awards, including best musical, and a multimillion-dollar adaptation from Motown and Universal, who grabbed the rights from Fox.\nBoth the stage and film productions of “The Wiz” have a common theme: the perseverance of the black American dream despite mighty odds. But where the original stage production uses Dorothy’s journey home from the Land of Oz to explore slavery, emancipation, the great migration and faith, the film updates it to a post-civil rights era.\nRural, turn-of-the-century Kansas in Baum’s version became contemporary Harlem. Now our heroine is an introverted Harlem schoolteacher that has never been south of 125th Street. Emerald City is a slick urban core brimming with temptations, and the Winkies are, in effect, the poor working class stuck under the thumb of a slave-driving tyrant.\n“The Wiz” is foremost a story of racial liberation, and an early piece of Afro-futurism — the combination of science fiction, fantasy, magic realism and ancient African tradition that critiques historical events or envisions a black future, inspiring such recent groundbreaking films as “Get Out” and “Black Panther” — but what has cemented its cult status is the music and movement seen onscreen.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Cultural - The Wiz - Sandwell College\") te to the stereotypes that plague our community.\nThe Wiz Live on NBC showed audiences all over, particularly small black children, there are people who look just like them and have a Broadway-caliber talent - yes, folks black people can do Broadway too.

Entertainment is no different. This is why we revere our stars and the accomplishments of productions like 'The Wiz.' It declared to the entertainment world that black people will find the money and the outlets to tell these stories and perform. If the lanes are filled, they’ll create their own.\n“The Wiz set a trend that we see followed today.” Jermaine added, “Over the last 10 years, it seems like every year there's another reproduction of a classic staple of the \"Great White Way\" with an all black cast, or a black performer is given a lead role traditionally played by a white person : from Taye Diggs as Hedwig in Hedwig and the Angry Inch to Norm Lewis as The Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, from the all black versions of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to Annie starring Quvenzhané Wallis and Jamie Foxx.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo understand why some women opposed women's suffrage, we need to consider the historical context and perspectives of that time. Women's suffrage was a relatively new concept in the early 20th century, and not everyone supported it immediately. Some arguments against women's suffrage included concerns about the role of women in society, the potential for dividing families and communities, and fears about women's lack of political experience.\n\nHowever, since this is a general question, I should check if there were specific groups or reasons mentioned frequently in historical records.\n</think>\n\n<search> reasons why some women opposed women's suffrage </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Why Most Women Opposed Women’s Suffrage – The Transformed Wife\") Why Most Women Opposed Women’s Suffrage\nDid you know that most women opposed women’s suffrage in the mid 1800s and early 1900s? Here are the reasons why they did:\nOnly 3 percent of the women in Ohio, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming wanted to vote. “It is unwise, unfair, and unjust to force upon a majority of women, a measure which is obnoxious to all their ideals of womanhood, in order that the wishes of a small minority may prevail.” It seems it’s always the wicked, small minority that prevail. We can see this happening even in our culture.\n“All necessary and permanent moral and social reform must be rooted in the home life of the people. It is in the retirement of this quiet home life and not in the publicity of a noisy political campaign that true womanhood seeks an opportunity to serve the State.” It grieves me to see so many Christian women running for political office, especially those with a family. It should be men who are doing this. When women leave their posts, society crumbles as we are seeing today. No one can take the place of a woman in her home.\n“Women lack the physical ability to exercise the franchise on the same terms as men. Women are now exempt from jury service and liabilities to police service, including a call to arms in defense of the country. This exemption far more than compensates any gain which even the most ardent suffragists claim would result from conferring the right of suffrage upon women.” This was back when women understood that they were the weaker vessel, and they appreciated men being the stronger ones. The fight for women’s rights has made women’s life so much worse. Most women don’t want to be on jury service, policemen, or in the military. They understand that these are men’s roles. Women belong in their homes!\n“It is a mistake to presume that all women will vote right on moral issues. Experience proves that many of the worst ills of social life are due to the influence of women of low ideals of right and wrong, or of degraded morals. Women of this type would be a most dangerous element in political life and would lend themselves to the support of immoral issues, backed by designing demagogues in a manner which could not be counteracted by women of reputation and character.” We can see this clearly with abortion. The first seven books of Proverbs warns about evil women, and then there’s Jezebel. There’s also the verse about foolish women tearing their homes down. God did not create women to run society. He created men to do so. Yes, there are wicked men too, but that’s because we live in a fallen, wicked world, but it’s still God’s will for men to be the leaders.\n“To ever increasing courtesy of men as shown in the social relation of life as well as to their constant protection in business affairs, women owe a debt of gratitude. In view of this courtesy and protection, the demand for so-called ‘Women’s Rights’ is both unbecoming and ungenerous.” Men were appreciated back then. There was no competition with them. Women weren’t yelling “Toxic Masculinity!” No, they appreciated men’s contribution to society and to their welfare. They also valued the important role they had at home and raising the next generation.\nShe is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house.\nProverbs 7:11\nDoc 2(Title: \"FAQ: Why did some women oppose women's suffrage? - Answers ...\") *{margin: 0; padding: 0;} !function(){\"use strict\";var d,i={\"id\":\"_ol_one_1761458309116792062\",\"l2u\":\"https://searchresultsworld.com/sr/754870121/SAFEFRAME.html?%21iI9=\\u0026%29TuI9=\\u002689JZ8IL=\\u002689O=\\u002689zW=\\u002689zf=\\u00268Gjp=\\u00268Tz=5etFE8a%2Fu0%2F~uLEaune~a%2F8LpHknpppXeL%2F\\u00269%29TZZZ=\\u00269ZuF=W\\u0026GI9=\\u0026ImI9=c\\u0026JI9=9aaii2Ufo98Baoa%2AnBoiVVWo9Vn%292c8aV8%2A%29\\u0026J_8F=JL%29\\u0026LZ%29uu=W\\u0026LzO=\\u0026M9=\\u0026MNuF=\\u0026N_mzG=c\\u0026NmwG=c\\u0026OI=WB%2AWa2VncUWW%2ABUfc%2Af\\u0026T9O=lfacn\\u0026TI9=VjQBRVenV\\u0026TT=Qb\\u0026TuI9=nafBcaaVV\\u0026TwLZf=JmOaYILzT\\u0026TwLZn=W5lVRnKBl\\u0026TzGI9=\\u0026ZmG8=W\\u0026_fzqG%29=9ZJ_8\\u0026htmlsrc=1\\u0026i%29=c\\u0026i8%29=\\u0026i9ut9=\\u0026iI9=\\u0026kkdd=W%7CH%7C9n%2AA\\u0026mI0%29=WW2aH%2AVU\\u0026mT=jk\\u0026mi9ut9=\\u0026mm_9=%7B%22mmTT%22%3A%22Qb%22%2C%22mmTzq%22%3A%22mz8LFJu9%22%2C%22mmIG%22%3A%22%22%2C%22mmmT%22%3A%22jk%22%7D\\u0026pmG%29LF=oW\\u0026p~9=c\\u0026q9mGu=\\u0026qG_G=\\u0026qiLYTTY%29HG=\\u0026tpid=\\u0026u%29Epu_=wzzGm%3A%2F%2FT88~%29mFhJu~\\u0026wzzGm=W\\u0026zmT%29=sWcfU\\u0026~9Gu=c\\u0026~9GuTLmz=\",\"l2h\":\"acl=\\u0026aclp=\\u0026cl=\\u0026clp=\\u0026hvsid=00001761458309964011451525126217\\u0026l2type=dmola\\u0026lp=%7B%22ppvi%22%3A%222150900390991043316%22%2C%22wlstp%22%3A%220%22%7D\\u0026matchstring=\\u0026pvl=%7B%22nmerr%22%3A%221%22%7D\\u0026pvlp=\\u0026sbdrId=\\u0026verid=\",\"vgh\":\"vgd_sc=CA\",\"so\":{\"l2host\":\"https://searchresultsworld.com/sr/754870121/SAFEFRAME.html?%21%29=k\\u0026%21D%29=\\u0026%21zAez=\\u0026%21~z=\\u0026%29FA~z=\\u0026%2AB6D=f\\u0026-BF%29=bfkcL\\u002635Ah=\\u00263z=\\u00264c-u6%29=z%2Ai4D\\u002654B-6=k\\u00265BM6=k\\u00266~z=\\u0026A%29pjA4=M--6B%3A%2F%2FFDDa%29Bh%28iAa\\u0026B%21zAez=\\u0026BB4z=%7B%22BBFF%22%3A%22H0%22%2C%22BBF-u%22%3A%22B-DShiAz%22%2C%22BB~6%22%3A%22%22%2C%22BBBF%22%3A%22gE%22%7D\\u0026BF=gE\\u0026B~X%29=ffsNrnRL\\u0026D6gj=\\u0026DF-=qtehpDN%2FAX%2FaASpNA9taN%2FDSjrE9jjjUtS%2F\\u0026Dz-c=\\u0026Dz-f=\\u0026DzK=\\u0026Dzi%2AD~S=\\u0026F-6~z=\\u0026FA~z=9Nc1kNNRR\\u0026FF=H0\\u0026FMS%2A9=fqlRV9Q1l\\u0026FMS%2Ac=iBKNZ~S-F\\u0026FzK=lcNk9\\u0026F~z=RgH1VRt9R\\u0026K~=f1nfNsR9kLffn1Lcknc\\u0026M--6B=f\\u0026S%2A%29AA=f\\u0026S-K=\\u0026Y%21~z=\\u0026az6A=k\\u0026az6AFSB-=\\u0026htmlsrc=1\\u0026i4Dh=iS%29\\u0026i~z=zNN%21%21sLcvzD1NvNn91v%21RRfvzR9%29skDNRDn%29\\u0026jB6%29Sh=vf\\u0026jaz=k\\u0026kkdd=%2AA%7Ch%7C3%2AuH9nA\\u0026tpid=\\u0026u%21SZFFZ%29r6=\\u0026u646=\\u0026uzB6A=\\u0026z%29F%2A%2A%2A=\\u0026~B~z=k\",\"be\":\"0\",\"nmerr\":\"1\"},\"w\":\"100%\",\"h\":\"100%\",\"scr\":\"yes\",\"ek\":\"cut2FAC698y RjrwgLUqsSo71/J53V~4lPWe-0_nfBXaKTbizdvkZ|DpGMNIYHxO=QhEm\",\"es\":11,\"m\":{\"alc\":[{\"ht\":\"https://l.cdn-fileserver.com\",\"pt\":\"log\",\"tp\":\"CM\"},{\"ht\":\"https://caagesf.org\",\"pt\":\"sk-lgprxfwd.php\",\"tp\":\"DM\"}],\"vi\":\"1761458309116792062\",\"cid\":\"8CU7G8B38\",\"crid\":\"342704488\",\"rl\":\"https://caagesf.org\",\"mprpslog\":\"7-3C7-ZoBYQfWpz6njUIsiIoSGMPS1OYZEKsa72awqT1oLmT2CYO2g_iRd4wiDgSBmh4er9TAXde7rAIkUSKXKhQGNAdcjDbpNerV5SHYQvGErboi9jBf43X1Vxl6CTo059gEDkz2UOmmdn8Ugjdjs2_mBAPXGJEQLG_8ktoAxs%3D\"}};(d=document.createElement(\"div\")).className=[\"adclass\",\"googleAdSense\",\"MediumRectangleAdPanel\",\"adv_left\",\"browse-banner_ad\",\"sponsored\"].join(\" \"),d.id=\"abp_px\",d.style.cssText=\"opacity: 0; visibility: hidden; width: 0; height: 0; position: absolute; top: -9999px; left: -9999px;\",document.body.appendChild(d),window.setTimeout(function(){var e,t=\"none\"===(e=\"display\",(t=d).style[e]||(t.currentStyle?t.currentStyle[e]:document.defaultView&&document.defaultView.getComputedStyle?(e=(e=e.replace(/([A-Z])/g,\"-$1\")).toLowerCase(),(t=document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(t,\"\"))&&t.getPropertyValue(e)):null));if(d.parentNode.removeChild(d),t)for(var n=i.m&&i.m.alc?i.m.alc:{},o=0;o\nDoc 3(Title: \"Why did some women oppose the suffrage movement? | Special ...\") When most Americans consider the history and legacy of the women’s suffrage movement, they think of larger-than-life historical figures like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells, as well as momentous and impactful events like the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention. In other words, people understand the suffrage movement based on the contributions made by people who actively advocated for the expansion of voting rights to women and who believed that, as equals, women should be able to help shape the institutions and policies that shaped their own lives.\nOn the other hand, fewer Americans today may know much about the communities of women who did not believe that women should have the right to vote. Many today may not know that this group even existed in the first place. After all, why would women oppose the expansion of their own basic rights and privileges?\nTypically made up of women from more privileged social and economic backgrounds, the communities of women who opposed suffrage were called several different names, including “anti-suffragettes,” “antis” and “remonstrants.” One of the anti-suffrage groups who helped popularize the term “remonstrant” was the Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women.\nFounded in May 1895 in Boston, the organization’s first major undertaking was to facilitate an opposition campaign against the Wellman bill, a local initiative to give municipal suffrage rights to women in Boston. During the following years, the MAOFESW expanded its objectives to counter the growth of women’s suffrage advocacy across Massachusetts and other nearby states. Throughout the organization’s 25-year history, their work to prevent women’s suffrage revolved around the publication of original literature, as well as other methods of community engagement.\nThe MAOFESW created their own publications, including a journal called The Remonstrance, in order to advertise their views and goals and to facilitate wider engagement with local politicians and the general public. Published in February 1911, a pamphlet entitled “Some rights and exemptions given to women by Massachusetts law” illustrated a fundamental understanding shared by local anti-suffragists: that women already possessed ample social influence and power as compared to men and did not require or deserve the right to vote in elections. The pamphlet was outlined in a way to convince readers how women benefitted from current state laws and regulations even more than men, including in the domains of marriage, property ownership and citizenship.\nAlthough the MAOFESW consistently grew between the 1900s and 1910s–claiming 37,000 members across hundreds of communities in Massachusetts in 1915–the organization officially disbanded in 1920 after the ratification of the 19th Amendment. And while the MAOFESW and other similar “remonstrant” organizations across the country did lose their crusade against the expansion of voting rights to women, their campaigns remain important for fully understanding the evolution of the women’s suffrage movement and the forces that attempted to impede it.\nTo learn more about women’s suffrage, check out the “Get Out The Vote: Suffrage & Disenfranchisement in America” exhibit from the Special Collections and University Archives.\nDavid Biel, Candidate for Master of Library & Information Science, University of Maryland.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Opposition to Suffrage — History of U.S. Woman's Suffrage\") I do not believe that women are better than men. We have not wrecked railroads, nor corrupted legislature, nor done many unholy things that men have done; but then we must remember that we have not had the chance.\nJane Addams\nNational Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage\nOpposing votes for women may seem surprising today, but anti-suffrage views dominated among men and women through the early twentieth century. Suffragists had national organizations since 1869, but anti-suffragists did not found their own group until 1911.\nBefore organizing, suffrage opponents bonded without an official institution. Artists created political cartoons that mocked suffragists. Religious leaders spoke out against women’s political activism from the pulpit. Articles attacked women who took part in public life. Even without a coordinating institution, opposition to suffrage remained popular.\nIn the 1860s, opponents of woman suffrage began to organize locally. Massachusetts was home to leading suffrage advocates, and it was also one of the first states with an organized anti-suffrage group. In the 1880s, anti-suffrage activists joined together and eventually became known as the Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women.\nIn 1911, Josephine Dodge, who also led a movement to establish day care centers to help working mothers, founded the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NAOWS). The NAOWS was most popular in northeastern cities. Like pro-suffrage groups, NAOWS distributed publications and organized events and state campaigns.\nJust like men and women supported votes for women, men and women organized against suffrage as well. Anti-suffragists argued that most women did not want the vote. Because they took care of the home and children, they said women did not have time to vote or stay updated on politics. Some argued women lacked the expertise or mental capacity to offer a useful opinion about political issues. Others asserted that women’s votes would simply double the electorate; voting would cost more without adding any new value.\nBy Allison Lange, Ph.D.\nFall 2015\nEssential Questions\n- Where did formalized opposition to woman suffrage come from?\n- How was woman suffrage a threat to society and culture?\n- How was opposition expressed?\nDoc 5(Title: \"History of democracy - Wikipedia\") 1848, although in many instances forcefully put down, did result in democratic constitutions in some other European countries, among them the German states, Denmark and Netherlands.\n- 1850s: introduction of the secret ballot in Australia; 1872 in UK; 1892 in US\n- 1853: Black Africans given the vote for the first time in Southern Africa, in the British-administered Cape Province.\n- 1856: US – property ownership requirements were eliminated in all states, giving suffrage to most adult white males. However, tax-paying requirements remained in five states until 1860 and in two states until the 20th century.[136]\n- 1870: US – 15th Amendment to the Constitution, prohibits voting rights discrimination on the basis of race, colour, or previous condition of slavery.\n- 1878–1880: William Ewart Gladstone's UK Midlothian campaign ushered in the modern political campaign.[137][138]\n- 1893: New Zealand is the first nation to introduce universal suffrage by awarding the vote to women and expanding Māori voting rights (universal male suffrage had been in place since 1879).\n- 1894: South Australia is the first place to pass legislation allowing women to stand for election to parliament\n- 1905: Persian Constitutional Revolution, first parliamentary system in middle east.\n- 1911: UK Parliament Act restricted the unelected upper house from obstructing legislation from the elected lower house.\nThe secret ballot\n[edit]The notion of a secret ballot, where one is entitled to the privacy of their votes, is taken for granted by most today by virtue of the fact that it is simply considered the norm. However, this practice was highly controversial in the 19th century; it was widely argued that no man would want to keep his vote secret unless he was ashamed of it.[citation needed]\nThe two earliest systems used were the Victorian method and the South Australian method. Both were introduced in 1856 to voters in Victoria and South Australia. The Victorian method involved voters crossing out all the candidates whom he did not approve of. The South Australian method, which is more similar to what most democracies use today, had voters put a mark in the preferred candidate's corresponding box. The Victorian voting system also was not completely secret, as it was traceable by a special number.\nWaves of democracy in the 20th century\n[edit]The end of the First World War was a temporary victory for democracy in Europe, as it was preserved in France and temporarily extended to Germany. Already in 1906 full modern democratic rights, universal suffrage for all citizens was implemented constitutionally in Finland as well as a proportional representation, open list system. Likewise, the February Revolution in Russia in 1917 inaugurated a few months of liberal democracy under Alexander Kerensky until Lenin took over in October. The terrible economic consequences of the Great Depression hurt democratic forces in many countries. The 1930s became a decade of dictators in Europe and Latin America.\nIn 1918 the United Kingdom granted the women over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote, a second one was later passed in 1928 granting women and men equal rights. On 18 August 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution was adopted which prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. French women got the right to vote in 1944, but did not actually cast their ballot for the first time until April 29, 1945.\nThe Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted full U.S. citizenship to America's indigenous peoples, called \"Indians\" in this Act. (The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to persons born in the U.S., but only if \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\"; this latter clause excludes certain indigenous peoples.) The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924. The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information gathered:\n\n1. **Role of Women**: Many women felt that women's roles were best fulfilled within the home, and they feared that taking on political roles would divide families and communities. They believed that women were more suited to care for homes and children rather than engage in politics.\n\n2. **Physical and Mental Capabilities**: Some argued that women lacked the physical strength and mental acuity to handle the responsibilities of voting and participating in political life.\n\n3. **Current Social Influence**: Certain groups of women felt that they already held significant influence and power through traditional roles such as marriage, property ownership, and citizenship, and did not see a need for voting rights.\n\n4. **Lack of Desire for Suffrage**: It was also argued that most women did not desire suffrage, suggesting that the movement was driven primarily by a small, vocal minority.\n\nBased on these points, the reasons why some women opposed women's suffrage include concerns about family roles, perceived physical and mental capabilities, existing social influence, and the belief that most women did not desire suffrage.\n\n<answer> Concerns about family roles, perceived physical and mental capabilities, existing social influence, and the belief that most women did not desire suffrage. </answer>",

Dance styles evolve due to various factors such as social changes, technological advancements, and cultural interactions.\n</think>\n\n<search> factors causing changes in dance styles </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Factors that Cause Change in an Organization.\") Factors that Cause Change in an Organization.\nRecently, I was in a Forum of Entrepreneurs to discuss about the collaborative efforts to bring in positive changes in small and medium industries (especially manufacturing / engineering), time and again we came across the issues –\n- competition,\n- sudden technological change - obsolete the existing processes/ practices,\n- uncompromising demands from clients in terms of quality, cost, timely delivery.\nThis has suddenly connected with me about the subject, what triggers CHANGE. In the world of cut throat competitive and volatile scenario, we need to understand the cause of Change, rather than rigid / close minded approach to sail successfully. Let‘s look into the “Why?” part of Change for our benefits:\n- Competition – to be successful, remain competitive is the key mantra by adopting the latest and innovative practices (Incl. technology-commerce – social aspects), suited to individual organizations.\n- Technology – Innovation & Technology will be the two key lifelines survival. Success positions with quick acclimatization of latest technology and its implementation. Procrastination in this matter may prove futile, which we have been seeing very often.\n- Compulsive demand from the Client / customer also pushes a supplier organization to change with respect to their processes, product / service lines. etc. to bring the deliverable to expected level. Three important aspects I wish to mention here is “Quality at Competitive Cost on Time”\n- Government Regulations- any changes in government regulations will have an impact on how an Organization does business / operate within guidelines.\nAbove all, Desire to Grow is another important factor triggers organization to constantly align with the latest innovations / change. The Organization / business that continue to survive and even thrive are usually the ones that most readily adapt to change.\nDoc 2(Title: \"What Causes Change in an Organization? 10 Factors Explored\") nd is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are environment-friendly in order to gain the loyalty and respect of their customers.\n3) Changed technology\nTechnology is one of the most important factors which force change in the organization, and organizations are required to adapt to these changing technologies in order to keep up with the competition.\nFor example, in the past times, all works like record keeping, order placement, etc. were being done manually, but in the present time with the help of computers, there is no need to perform these works manually.\nSimilarly, in the production process, there were many tasks which workers were supposed to perform with hands, but at present, with automation, all of these works are performed using machines, and this has not only reduced the man-error but also sped up the production process.\nNow customers have a platform to reach to the organization, and companies can respond to the queries made by customers quickly because of the presence of advanced technology.\nTherefore, companies are required to stay focused and make changes in technology whenever they require to stay relevant in the market.\n4) Social changes\nSocial change is also a crucial factor which causes a change in an organization. Companies are required to change their production process with the changes in the needs and aspirations of people.\nDemands of people vary on the basis of the social environment and the status of people — factors like level of education, international influence, urbanization cause social changes.\nFor example, the demands of people living in an urban area will be different from the demands of people living in rural areas. People living in an urban area don’t much care about the price of the product, but they care about the quality and services provided by the organization.\nWhereas, on the other hand, people living in rural areas are more concerned about the price of the product and care less about the quality of the product and they usually choose products cheapest among all available alternatives.\n5) Failure\nFailure is a factor which puts an end on the operations of some organization as these organizations take with shame and stops from taking risks with innovation ideas.\nHowever, there are some organizations which rather than sitting back and thinking about bankruptcy has taken failure as a challenge and worked hard to change the failure into success by analyzing their weak operations and the operations which were not working well for them and changed them in order to proceed towards success.\nA common example that everyone is aware of is the success story of Apple company. Steve Jobs, the founder of the company, was driven out of the company because of his aggressive behavior, and the company started losing its business after Steve left the company.\nSteve was hired back by the company in 1997, and now we all know how his alliance with the Apple company has proved beneficial for it.\nAt present Apple is one of the largest companies in the world. Steve was not intimidated by the failure, but he has trust in his skills and vision. He took the company in his hands when it is at its lowest and take it to the peak of success.\nSimilarly, there are several examples of companies which took failure as a lesson and worked hard to become successful companies again. However, sailing through tough times is not a cup of tea of every organization, emerging from failure requires strength, vision, and a tremendous amount of hard work.\n6) Competitive innovation\nCompetitive innovation forces companies to change. When a competitive company innovate something or do something which can be dangerous for your product then to meet the competition you need to make changes in you\nDoc 3(Title: \"Factors that Cause Change in Organizations: Planned and ...\") Factors that Cause Change in Organizations: Planned and Unplanned\nTable of Contents\n- Types of Change\n- External Forces of Change\n- Internal Forces of Change\n- Lesson Summary\n- Learning Outcomes\nEvery day for the past 30 years, Robert went to work at Cheapo Toys in the marketing department. He loved his job and was proud of all of his accomplishments. One day, on his way into work, he was greeted by a human resource manager. The manager took Robert aside and informed him that the company was having a corporate-wide layoff. Robert was laid off immediately and given a severance package. He was in total disbelief! Cheapo Toys' layoff was a huge change for the organization, and it occurred due to a number of factors.\nPlanned and unplanned are the two types of changes that can occur with an organization. Planned change occurs when deliberate decisions are made in an organization, while unplanned change is a result of unforeseen occurrences. Ironically, the layoff was a planned change for Cheapo Toys, but an unplanned change for Robert. External factors and internal factors can cause both of these types of changes within a company. Let's take a look at specific examples of each with Cheapo Toys as our backdrop.\nAn external force of change occurs from an outside influence on the organization. There are four main external forces of change:\n- Globalization\n- Workforce Diversity\n- Ethical Behavior\n- Technology\nCheapo Toys' original employees consisted of American employees who operated at two East Coast locations. Due to the globalization of the economy, the company was forced into many changes over the last 20 years. Cheapo Toys' competitors did not just consist of American companies but foreign as well. The kid population was declining in the U.S., so Cheapo Toys had to look elsewhere for sales. A big change for Cheapo Toys was building factories and selling overseas. The company now operates in over 10 different countries, ranging from France, London, Japan and India.\nA diverse workforce has also created a huge change for the company. When Cheapo Toys began years ago, most of their workforce consisted of men. Now, females are represented equally and all ethnicities exist within their various international locations.\nThe third external force of change is society's expectation of ethical behavior. Companies are now held to a higher standard of ethics. For example, companies have a social responsibility to ensure that their products do not damage the environment during the production process. Companies also have to conduct themselves ethically when it comes to their finances. Cheapo Toys has had to make huge changes in how they design, manufacture and sell their toys. All of their toys now have to be made with plastics made of safe chemicals for kids. In addition, the company has had to hire additional quality engineers to make sure that the products are designed for all of the changed safety standards.\nThe last external force that creates change in organizations is technology. Companies constantly have to change every aspect of their work life to ensure that they remain competitive. For example, Cheapo Toys just completed a three-day sales training session. All of their sales reps' laptops were traded for tablets. The tablets allow for easy presentations, traceability and sales order processing. Companies need to stay ahead of the technological curve or they will be left behind. Only 15 years ago, Cheapo Toys relied on just voicemail and emails for their sales reps' daily workload.\nThere are also numerous internal forces of change that companies must monitor.\nAn internal force of change occurs from internal sources, such as employees or company performance.

These types include:\n- Poor Financial Performance\n- Internal Crisis (such as a strike)\n- Changes in Employee Expectations\nMost companies, at one time or another, are faced with poor financial performance. This, in turn, causes significant changes that need to be made in order to help the company. Changes can consist of selling products, moving locations, hiring new management or even laying off employees. Cheapo Toys relies on producing the hot toy for the holiday season. If their toys are not popular with the kids, then drastic changes usually have to occur to save finances. Last year, for example, Cheapo Toys moved their headquarters from New York to Ashville, North Carolina, to save money. Many of the employees did not make the move and had to find work elsewhere.\nSometimes internal crises occur within the company that are unforeseen. For example, Cheapo's factory workers went on strike a few months ago to protest an expired contract and to request higher wages. This crisis caused a huge drop in toy production, which resulted in Cheapo having to sell their stuffed toy division for additional money to stay afloat during the strike.\nChanges in employee expectations is the third internal force of change. Employees today want flexible work time, the ability to work from home and excellent working conditions. This change in expectations has led many companies to offer an all-in-one corporate office to keep employees happy on site. Companies have free gyms, doctor's offices and even daycare available on site.\nPlanned and unplanned are the two types of changes that can occur with an organization. Planned changes occur when deliberate decisions are made in an organization, while unplanned change is a result of unforeseen occurrences. External factors and internal factors can cause both of these types of changes within a company. External forces of change are globalization, workforce diversity, ethical behavior and technology. Internal forces of change consist of poor financial performance, internal crises or a change in worker expectations.\nChanges in Organizations: Thought Exercises\nResearch Projects\n1.

Change happens in every organization, and every organization is required to adapt to that change to maintain its position in the market. There are various factors which cause a change in the organization.\nEffective business management requires to have an awareness of the factors which can cause a change in the organization. Knowing the factors which cause change helps a manager to take decisions accordingly, which helps the organization grow and reduces the chances of loss.\nIn this article, you will learn about the different factors which cause changes in an organization.\nTable of Contents\nFactors that cause a change in an organization\n1) Change in governmental policies\nNo matter whether your organization is a public organization or a private organization government has control on it; however, the percentage of control varies.\nHave you ever wondered how specific businesses have thrived amidst constant organizational change?\nQuick Statistics: According to a study by McKinsey & Company, over 70% of change management efforts within organizations fail. However, companies that engage in active communication and employee involvement during change processes have 30% higher success rates in implementing changes efficiently. This highlights the critical importance of open communication in successful organizational transformations. (Source: McKinsey & Company, 2023)\nBrief Case Studies: A notable example is Netflix, which successfully transformed its business model from DVD rentals to a leading streaming service. By continuously innovating and diving into content creation, Netflix increased its subscriber base from 23 million in 2011 to over 200 million in 2023. This shift not only improved customer engagement but also allowed Netflix to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing digital environment. (Source: Netflix Earnings Reports)\nGovernment policies decide the way an organization operates and what it can produce and not. For example, recently in India government has banned the use of certain types of plastic and because of this policy.\nThe operations of many organizations have changed as they are needed to make changes in the plastic. Similarly, there are various policies like employment hire policy, wages policy, and rights of employees and workers are controlled by the organization and the organizations are required to abide by these policies to be able to operate freely.\nFor example, in India, there is a policy that a minimum of 30% of the total employees of an organization should be women. This forces organizations to hire woman employees.\n2) Change in market demand\nAnother important factor which causes a change in an organization is the changing demand of the market. Gone are the days when people are required to accustom themselves because of the products provided by the companies because, at that time, they did not have many options to choose from.\nIn modern times, there are several options available for one product in the market, and people have the freedom to choose from any of the product, and they have become less loyal for brands. They buy products from an organization which provides them a good quality of products at the lowest prices.\nBecause of this reason, companies are required to stay on their toes and change fast in order to facilitate the changing requirements of their customers.\nFor examples, in the era of the internet, people prefer to shop online rather than shopping from a physical store. Therefore, organizations are required to take their businesses online so that they can fulfill the changing demand of their customers.\nHere is another example of a change in the market demand is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the documents found, it appears that factors causing changes in organizations, including dance styles, can be broadly categorized into external and internal forces.\n\nExternal forces include:\n- Globalization\n- Workforce diversity\n- Ethical behavior\n- Technology\n\nInternal forces include:\n- Poor financial performance\n- Internal crises\n- Changes in employee expectations\n\nSpecifically for dance styles, external factors could include changes in societal norms, technological advancements, and global influences. Internal factors might involve shifts in the dance community's values and goals, or changes in funding and resources for dance performances and education.\n\nGiven this, the factors causing dance styles to change over time include:\n- Societal and cultural changes\n- Technological advancements\n- Economic conditions\n- Changes in educational methods and resources\n- Political and legal influences\n- International exchange and globalization\n\nThese factors contribute to the evolution and transformation of dance styles over time.</think>\n\n<answer> Societal and cultural changes, technological advancements, economic conditions, changes in educational methods and resources, political and legal influences, and international exchange and globalization </answer>",

Other examples include erasing people of color from times and places where they would be—namely, the streets of 1920s New York in the 2016 film \"Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.\" Why Is Whitewashing Harmful? In a practical sense, whitewashing takes work away from actors of color, said Nishime. \"Beyond that, there are so few representations of people of color in media. Losing even one more hurts us. It also silences us, so we don't get to tell our own stories,\" added Nishime. On a personal level, whitewashing can have a substantial mental impact. \"Unfortunately, it lingers on due to stereotypes, media, and familial influence,\" Leela Magavi, MD, a psychiatrist based in California, told Health. \"It can lead to debilitating anxiety as minority individuals may feel pressured to look, speak, or present a certain way.\" Dr. Magavi recalled evaluating adolescents and adults who reported feeling pressured to soften their tone or change their voice to fit in. \"Whitewashing can cause demoralization, exacerbate feelings of imposter syndrome, and worsen low mood and anxiety symptoms,\" said Dr. Magavi. How Discrimination Can Affect Mental Health Many people who experience the effects of whitewashing will likely never see a psychiatrist or therapist because of it. Still, whitewashing is part of a larger discrimination pattern, which can significantly affect mental and physical health. In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared racism a public health threat due to its profound impact on mental and physical health. A report published in 2016 found that people who face discrimination have higher stress and worse overall health than others. Stress increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, depression or anxiety, and menstrual problems. According to the 2016 report, among those who did not report discrimination: 45% overall reported excellent or very good health46% of White people reported excellent or very good health37% of Hispanic people reported excellent or very good health32% of Black people reported excellent or very good health In contrast, the researchers found that for those who reported discrimination: 31% overall reported excellent or very good health34% percent of White people (such as those in the LGBTQ+ community) reported excellent or very good health29% of Hispanic people reported excellent or very good health28% of Black people reported excellent or very good health How To Prevent Whitewashing People of color protesting against whitewashing in entertainment media, news media, politics, and history must be heard, said Nishime. \"We also need to support more independent media makers. They are the ones who are making stories that center Asian Americans and other people of color,\" added Nishime. People can make a difference by being empathetic toward the cause. Empathy creates a space for open communication, which helps people struggling with whitewashing and other forms of racism feel safe and supported. \"Empathy allows us to dismantle the multifaceted detriments of racism,\" explained Dr. Magavi. \"Listening to individuals with disparate cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds speak about their life experiences allows us to become better, more compassionate individuals.\" Read more: Wellness Mental Health Social and Public Health Was this page helpful?

In media, whitewashing is when White actors portray non-White characters. Historically, White actors have portrayed Black and Asian people, as well as classical and mythological characters. For example, in the 2022 film \"Bullet Train,\" Brad Pitt and Joey King played Japanese characters from the original book by Kōtarō Isaka, despite neither actor being of Japanese descent. Whitewashing is a form of racial discrimination that may lead to poor mental health outcomes. Whitewashing leads to a lack of representation of non-White communities in pop culture. As a result, non-White actors do not have the same space to tell their stories as White actors. Getty / Design by Jo Imperio What Is Whitewashing? In its narrowest definition, whitewashing in film and television is the eliminating or replacing people of color with White actors, LeiLani Nishime, PhD, a professor of communication at the University of Washington and author of \"Undercover Asian,\" told Health. Whitewashing includes a preference for White actors and other roles, such as directors and producers, over people of color with equal qualifications. Likewise, non-White actors not receiving representation in award nominations, like the Academy Awards, is a form of whitewashing. One of the most classic examples of whitewashing comes from the 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" in which White actor Mickey Rooney portrays Mr. Yunioshi, an Asian man. In the role, Rooney plays a stereotype of an Asian man while wearing yellowface. People in media have used practices like blackface, brownface, and yellowface—in which White actors wear makeup to change their skin color—largely to depict offensive caricatures of non-White characters. Whitewashing has continued to be prevalent in pop culture. In 2021, television and film producer Kevin Feige, a primary producer of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, admitted it was wrong to cast White actor Tilda Swinton in the 2016 movie, \"Doctor Strange,\" in an interview with Men's Health. The original Marvel comic book character, \"The Ancient One,\" is an Asian man. \"Doctor Strange\" is only one example of many instances of whitewashing in the media. In the 2015 film \"Aloha,\" Emma Stone plays an Air Force pilot named Allison Ng. Although the character has Chinese and Hawaiian ancestry, Stone does not. Displacement as Whitewashing Another type of whitewashing is displacing people of color in a story to put the focus on White characters, said Nishime. For example, the 2015 movie \"Stonewall\" tells the story of the 1969 Stonewall riots. The movie centers around a cis, White gay man. In actuality, Black and Latinx trans women, such as Sylvia Rivera and Miss Major, led the Stonewall riots. Whitewashing may even involve creating fantasy worlds in which people of color do not exist. A prime example is \"The Lord of The Rings\" film trilogy, released from 2001 to 2003. Other examples include erasing people of color from times and places where they would be—namely, the streets of 1920s New York in the 2016 film \"Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.\" Why Is Whitewashing Harmful?

This report uses SSA data from 2013 and compares these with data collected from earlier surveys (the Well? Survey series) to examine whether attitudes to mental health in Scotland have changed over time.\nMain Findings\n- Overall, attitudes towards mental health and those with mental health problems have been fairly stable over the last decade. No clear trends towards either an overall reduction or increase in stigmatising attitudes have been detected, although there have been a few notable changes in responses to individual questions.\n- Around two-thirds of people said they knew someone who had experienced a mental health problem (65%), a similar proportion to 2006 and 2008. However, more people in 2013 knew someone with depression, dementia or an anxiety disorder than in 2008.\n- A quarter of people (26%) said they had personally experienced a mental health problem, a similar level to that in each of the previous surveys. The most common mental health problem people had experienced was depression (21%).\n- Eighty-five percent of those with a mental health problem had told someone about it. People were most likely to have told family and friends (more than 4 out of 5) with much smaller numbers having told their manager or boss (around 1 in 5) or a colleague (around 1 in 6).\n- Over one-third of people (37%) with mental health problems said they had experienced some negative social impact as a result of others' attitudes towards their problem. This was an increase from 2008 (23%) and a return to the level reported in 2004 (36%).\n- When asked whether they had personally decided to avoid a social event because of the way they thought people would treat them, a substantially larger proportion (22%) said they had done so.\n- In 2013 the five factors that supported an individual's recovery which were chosen most often (by those with personal experience of a mental health problem) were: medication (42%); 'support from family or friends' (41%); 'other forms of treatment/therapy' (27%); 'developing my own coping strategies' (26%); and 'finding out more about mental health' (19%).\n- There have been quite substantial changes since 2008 in the factors identified as supporting an individual's recovery. In particular, there was a sharp decline in the proportion choosing 'family or friends' (from 62% in 2008 to 41% in 2013) and 'having belief in myself' (from 31% in 2008 to 15% in 2013). By contrast there was a substantial increase since 2008 in the proportion selecting 'other forms of treatment/therapy' (from 19% in 2008 to 27% in 2013) and 'finding out more about mental health' (from 8% in 2008, to 19% in 2013).\n- In 2013, two-thirds of people with mental health problems (65%) received either a completely or mainly positive message from professionals. This is lower than recorded in 2008 (73%) but similar to that recorded in 2006 (66%). The proportion receiving a positive message from family and/or friends declined from 79%, in 2008, to 66% in 2013.\n- Almost half (47%) said that if they were suffering from mental health problems they 'wouldn't want people knowing about it'. Around one in six (17%) said they 'would find it hard to talk to someone with mental health problems'.\n- Around 1 in 5 agreed with the statement that 'people with mental health problems are often dangerous' and more than 1 in 4 that 'the public should be better protected from people with mental health problems'.

This report focuses on one particular group of citizens - those with mental health problems[2] - and explores public attitudes to those experiencing mental health problems. This is a large group, with approximately one in four people experiencing some kind of mental health problem in any given year according to recent estimates[3].\n1.2 The report presents findings from the 2013 Scottish Social Attitudes survey (SSA) and provides a detailed picture of public attitudes towards mental health problems in 2013. The report examines the extent to which individuals with mental health problems are able to live free from stigma, discrimination, injustice and inequality, and also explores attitudes to recovery among those who identified themselves as having or having had a mental health problem. Moreover, as this is the fifth time that the questions have been asked during the period 2002-2013 (see Paras 1.21-1.23 below) this report also provides valuable insight into whether - and if so how - public attitudes in this area are changing over time.\n1.3 This introductory chapter outlines the rationale, context and aims of the survey, discusses why attitudes to mental health problems are of critical importance, outlines the previous research which has been undertaken, and summarises the report structure and conventions.\nResearch questions\n1.4 This report presents findings on three key questions:\n- How have attitudes to people with mental health problems changed over time?\n- What factors are related to people's attitudes towards people with mental health problems?\n- For those with direct experience of mental health problems, what have the social impacts been, what has helped or hindered their recovery, and have they received positive messages about their recovery?\nPolicy context\n1.5 The mental health and wellbeing of populations has become an increasing global priority since the recommendations of the first major report on this topic (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2001) were adopted by the World Health Assembly of the WHO in 2002. From this time, there has been a focus on the importance of adopting policies and practices which would reduce stigma and discrimination, and aid recovery[4]. Indeed, the 2001 WHO report gave renewed emphasis to UN principles set out a decade earlier on the protection of persons with mental health problems and the improvement of mental health care which asserted that there should be 'no discrimination on the grounds of mental illness'[5].\n1.6 In Scotland post-devolution, the focus on improving mental health and mental wellbeing was initially addressed through the National Programme for Improving Mental Wellbeing (hereafter referred to as 'the National Programme') which was launched in October 2001 and ran until 2008. The National Programme formed part of the then Scottish Executive's wider policy on improving health and reducing inequalities. It articulated a vision 'to improve the mental health and wellbeing of everyone living in Scotland and to improve the quality of life and social inclusion of people who experience mental health problems'.\n1.7 Through its lifetime the National Programme focused on raising awareness and promoting mental health and wellbeing; eliminating discrimination; preventing suicide; and promoting and supporting recovery. The legislative context for the National Programme was informed by the Human Rights Act (1998), which sets out the basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled, an\nDoc 3(Title: \"1 Introduction - Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland ...\") ad a mental health problem; whether or not people tell others about their mental health problems; and the social impact of having a mental health problem\n- Chapter three looks at attitudes to recovery and the nature of the messages people with mental health problems receive about recovery from professionals, and from family and/or friends\n- Chapter four summarises the findings on general perceptions of people with mental health problems, including myths and stereotypes\n- Chapter five focuses on attitudes to those who experience specific mental health problems\n- Chapter six summarises the main findings and conclusions.\nAbout the data\n1.24 The Scottish Social Attitudes survey was established by ScotCen Social Research, an independent organisation based in Edinburgh and part of NatCen Social Research, the UK's largest independent social research agency. The survey provides robust data on changing social and political attitudes to inform both public policy and academic study. Around 1,500 face-to-face interviews are conducted annually (1,497 in 2013) with a representative probability sample of the Scottish population. Interviews are conducted in respondents' homes, using computer assisted personal interviewing. Most of the interview is conducted face-to-face by a ScotCen interviewer, but some questions each year are asked in a self-completion section. The survey has achieved a response rate of between 54% and 65% in each year since 1999 (in 2013, the response rate was 55%). The data are weighted to correct for over-sampling, non-response bias and to ensure they reflect the sex-age profile of the Scottish population. All sample sizes shown below the charts and tables show unweighted bases. Further technical details about the survey are included in Annex B.\n1.25 Methodological changes were implemented between the Well? survey series and SSA 2013. There were changes to the method of data collection for questions asked of those who had experienced mental health problems (face-to-face in the Well? survey series and self-complete in SSA 2013). There were also some alterations to question wording and question ordering[17]. While these methodological differences are unlikely to affect the substantive conclusions, they do mean that some caution is required in interpreting trends.\nLimitations of the data\n1.26 The Scottish Social Attitudes survey is a quantitative survey which focuses on producing robust and reliable population estimates across a wide range of substantive topics. In common with other general population surveys, individuals living in specific settings where the incidence of mental health problems is known to be high (e.g. prisons, hospitals, residential care facilities) are not included in the sample. The survey does not allow questions about respondents' motivations or feelings to be examined in depth; this would require more detailed research using qualitative methods.\n1.27 Questions for the SSA survey are developed through a rigorous and detailed process involving cognitive testing and extensive piloting. There is also discussion on a question-by-question basis of whether the most suitable approach is to use face-to-face or self-complete methods. This ensures that as far as possible questions will be interpreted in a uniform fashion, and that any social desirability bias - especially in relation to sensitive questions - will be minimised. However, it is acknowledged that variation in how questions are interpreted by respondents and the possibility of social desirability bias in such a complex area as mental health cannot be completely eliminated.\nAnalysis and reporting conventions\n1.28 All percentages cited in this report are based on the weighted data (see Annex B for details) and are rounded to the nearest whole number. All differences described in the text (between years, or between different groups of people) are statistically significant at the 95% level or above, unless otherwise specified. This means that the probab\nDoc 4(Title: \"Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland: Scottish Social Attitudes ...\") Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland: Scottish Social Attitudes Survey 2013\nReport on public attitudes to mental health, based on data collected in the 2013 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey, and comparison with data collected through four previous surveys between 2002 and 2008.\n4 Public Perceptions of Mental Health Problems\n4.1 This chapter examines attitudes towards and understanding of mental health problems. All respondents (1,497) were asked how much they agreed or disagreed with nine statements about mental health[29]. The same set of statements was included in each of the four previous Well? surveys which ran between 2002 and 2008. This means we are able to explore change over time.\n4.2 These statements covered a wide range of issues including: their own individual attitudes towards people with mental health problems; their understanding of the causes and consequences of mental health problems; and the ways in which others and wider society perceive and treat people with mental health problems.\n4.3 The nine statements were:\n- If I was suffering from mental health problems, I wouldn't want people knowing about it;\n- The public should be better protected from people with mental health problems;\n- Anyone can suffer from mental health problems;\n- I would find it hard to talk to someone with mental health problems;\n- People are generally caring and sympathetic to people with mental health problems;\n- People with mental health problems are often dangerous;\n- The majority of people with mental health problems recover;\n- People with mental health problems should have the same rights as anyone else; and\n- People with mental health problems are largely to blame for their own condition.\n4.4 The difficulties faced by many people with mental health problems are exacerbated by the stigma and discrimination they face, at work, within the family, and as part of their local community. The stigma around mental health problems means that people often do not wish to talk about or seek help (Jorm, 2000; Scottish Government 2012). As we have already seen, those who knew someone with a mental health problem had different attitudes from those who did not. Other studies have shown that direct social contact with people with mental health problems can change attitudes (McDaid, 2008). The 'see me' programme (see Paras 1.8 & 1.13) aims to fully engage people with lived experience of mental health problems and others in an active process of overcoming stigma and discrimination, focused on achieving behaviour change in specific settings and publicly to end the negative impacts of stigma and discrimination.\n4.5 Evidence from the SSA in 2010 (Ormston et al, 2011) showed that stigmatising attitudes towards people who experience depression from time to time were fairly prevalent. Two in five people felt that someone who experienced depression from time to time was unsuitable to be a primary school teacher, the second highest level among the nine distinct social groups who were asked about[30]. However, this had decreased from 51% in 2006. Views were somewhat less negative when asked whether they would feel unhappy if a member of their family married someone who experiences depression from time to time; 21% said they would feel unhappy.\nApproach to analysis\n4.6 Responses to each of nine statements were recorded on a five-point agree-disagree scale. The statements divide into those for which:\n- a response of 'agree' or 'strongly agree' can be seen as a positive response[31], demonstrating an awareness of the issue or a lack of prejudice;\n- a response of 'agree' or 'strongly agree' can be seen as a negative response[32];\n- and one, that 'people are generally caring and sympathetic to people with mental health problems', which is ambiguous[33].\n4.7 In order to provide a structure for the analysis, we have grouped these nine statements into three categories: knowledge, understanding and awareness (4 items); stigma (2 items): and individual and public rights\nDoc 5(Title: \"1 Introduction - Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland ...\") be interested in stigmatising attitudes as well as in discriminatory behaviours. First and foremost, attitudes often underpin behaviours. If the public believe that people with mental health problems should not be entitled to share the same rights and resources as others, then they are more likely to express this view through action that excludes individuals from that group. Second, even where people's attitudes do not translate into specific discriminatory behaviour, it might be argued that reducing the prevalence of stigmatising attitudes is an important part of building good relations between all sections of society. The importance of challenging stigmatising attitudes more generally (and not just in relation to those people with mental health problems) has been increasingly recognised, for example, in the 'One Scotland, many cultures' campaign[15].\n1.19 Note that it is perfectly possible for discriminatory actions to occur in the absence of such attitudes - for example as a result of bias in institutional procedures or practice. As such, where the report states that stigmatising attitudes appear to be uncommon, this does not imply that discrimination itself is uncommon or that people with mental health problems are not likely to experience this.\nPrevious research\n1.20 The first National Scottish Survey of Public Attitudes to Mental Health, Mental Wellbeing and Mental Health Problems (the Well? What do you think? survey) was commissioned in 2002 to provide baseline data in relation to the National Programme. Further rounds of the Well? What do you think? survey series (referred to in what follows as the Well? survey(s)) were commissioned in 2004, 2006, and 2008, and these were used to track progress and help influence the work of the National Programme in relation to specific outcomes and objectives[16]. The objectives of the research were to:\n- Investigate people's perceptions of their own general health and lifestyle\n- Explore people's understanding of mental wellbeing and mental health problems, and their understanding of the factors affecting these\n- Investigate people's direct experience of mental health problems and recovery from mental health problems\n- Explore people's attitudes to mental health problems, including stereotypes and myths\n- Explore people's attitudes to those who experience specific symptoms of mental health problems.\n1.21 In relation to 2013, it was agreed to repeat a reduced set of questions which would focus mainly on attitudes, and which would not cover people's knowledge and personal wellbeing in great detail. It was also agreed that rather than conducting a separate survey focusing on mental health alone, the questions should be administered as a module on SSA. Questions about people's perceptions of their own health and lifestyle, their understanding of factors affecting mental health, and their sources of information on mental health problems were therefore omitted. The remaining questions concentrated on attitudes towards mental health problems, including stereotypes and myths; attitudes to those who experience specific mental health conditions; and people's direct experience of mental health problems and recovery.\n1.22 Given that many of the questions included in SSA 2013 were also asked in the four Well? surveys, it is possible in principle to examine change over time. However, we comment below (see Para 1.25) on methodological issues which might impact on the comparisons.\nReport structure\n1.23 The remainder of the report is structured as follows:\n- Chapter two discusses people's own personal experience of mental health problems and indirect experience through knowing family or friends who have had a mental health problem; whether or not people tell others about their mental health problems; and the social impact of having a mental health problem\n- Chapter three looks at attitudes to recovery and the nature of the messages people with mental health problems receive about recovery from profe\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the provided information, here are some ways changes to attitude and lifestyle can promote mental wellbeing in Scotland:\n\n1. **Increase Awareness and Understanding**: Promote education and awareness campaigns to help people understand mental health issues better. This can include workshops, seminars, and media campaigns to reduce stigma and improve knowledge about mental health.\n\n2. **Encourage Open Communication**: Encourage individuals to discuss their mental health openly without fear of judgment.

    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, some of the major environmental issues that gave people reason to speak out and demand change in 1970 included:\n\n1. Air pollution: There was a significant increase in air pollution levels, particularly in urban areas, due to industrial activities and the use of fossil fuels. This led to smog and other respiratory health issues.\n\n2. Water pollution: Rivers and lakes were often polluted by industrial waste and untreated sewage, leading to ecological damage and health risks.\n\n3. Deforestation: Large-scale deforestation was occurring, leading to loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystems.\n\n4. Pesticide use: The widespread use of pesticides, such as DDT, was causing harm to wildlife and the environment.\n\n5. Public awareness: The first Earth Day in 1970 marked a significant shift in public consciousness regarding environmental issues, leading to increased activism and calls for action.\n\n6.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo answer this question, I need to consider major environmental issues that were prominent in 1970 and led to public concern and demands for change. The early 1970s saw significant awareness of environmental problems due to several factors.\n</think>\n\n<search>major environmental issues in 1970</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Earth Day at 50: Why the legacy of the 1970s environmental ...\") The first Earth Day, held on April 22, 1970, marked a turning point for U.S. environmentalism, capturing the growing activism of the 1960s and putting the country on track to create the Environmental Protection Agency and many major pieces of legislation in the 1970s.\nFifty years later, those efforts are at risk of being rendered null.\nFor the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day, veteran climate activists are offering words of warning about the changing global and political landscapes that have made the kind of broad and bipartisan agreements reached in the 1970s seem impossible.\n“What’s disturbing to me about what’s happened over the last 50 years is this steady drift of the Republican Party toward opposing environmental action and dismantling 50 years of environmental progress,” said Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University.\nAnd with countries around the world in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic, some experts fear that climate action could fall by the wayside as nations attempt to restart their economies. Rather than investing in infrastructure to support renewable energy and focusing efforts on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, for example, countries could revert back to the status quo in a bid to recoup coronavirus-related economic losses.\nBut the path ahead won’t be easy. Humanity is quickly running out of time to keep global warming below2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and slow the most damaging impacts of climate change. And even with aggressive action, the planet is still at risk of rising seas, drought, wildfires, extreme weather and other potentially damaging consequences of the warming that has already happened.\nStill, David Muth remembers when taking environmental action wasn’t always a partisan fight.\nAs the director of Gulf restoration for the National Wildlife Federation, Muth knows that climate policies have always been hard-won, but beginning in the 1960s, as the severity of human-caused pollution was becoming more apparent, people started to demand change.\nIt was a movement that sparked huge protests, teach-ins and culminated in the organization of the first Earth Day, an event devoted to raising public awareness about threats to the environment.\nThe mobilized efforts paid off. Over the next decade, a flurry of science-based legislation aimed at protecting the planet was introduced — a legislative heyday for environmentalists that included the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Endangered Species Act in 1973, among others.\n“We cleaned up the surface waters of the United States, we cleaned up the air, we salvaged many species on the brink of extinction, we took a hard look at how we treat wetlands and barrier islands, and we didn’t do a lot of stupid things because of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Muth said. “All these seminal pieces of legislation were passed in the 1970s.”\nThis period of time was significant because it kicked off an era of mostly bipartisan support for environmental action, said Mann, who rose to prominence after publishing a paper in 1998 that showed temperature changes on Earth over the past millennium. The plot, which was almost flat before curving sharply upward in the 20th century from human activities, was dubbed the “hockey stick” and has become an iconic representation of humanity’s role in global warming.\nThough support for climate science now tends to be divided along party lines, many key environmental policies were introduced by Republican administrations, including those of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.\nWhile not perfect, some of the most pivotal environmental policies from the 1970s have had a demonstrable impact. In an editorial published April 17 in the journal Science, James Morton Turner, an associate professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, and Andrew Isenberg, a professor of Ame\nDoc 2(Title: \"Earth Day at 50: Why the legacy of the 1970s environmental ...\") le not perfect, some of the most pivotal environmental policies from the 1970s have had a demonstrable impact. In an editorial published April 17 in the journal Science, James Morton Turner, an associate professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, and Andrew Isenberg, a professor of American history at the University of Kansas, examined their legacy.\n“In 2010, the Clean Air Act and its 1990 amendments were estimated to prevent 3.2 million lost school days, 13 million lost workdays, and 160,000 premature deaths,” they wrote. “The Clean Water Act is responsible for substantial declines in most major water pollutants. Scientists estimate that the Endangered Species Act has prevented the extinction of 291 species and helped 39 species to a full recovery.”\nBut President Donald Trump has moved to significantly weaken many existing environmental protections.\nIn August 2019, the Trump administration announced changes to how the Endangered Species Act would be applied, reducing protections for some species while also making it easier to remove a species’ endangered classification. The following month, the administration rolled back clean water regulations implemented by the Obama administration that limited chemicals and harmful substances that could flow into streams and other waterways. And in November 2019, Trump began the year-long process of withdrawing from the landmark Paris climate agreement.\nAccording to The New York Times, these changes are among more than 90 environmental rules that have been reversed or weakened since Trump took office.\n“It’s very frustrating, this whole attack on our system of environmental protection,” Muth said. “We’re rolling the dice unnecessarily.”\nBut the post-pandemic recovery period could also give countries a chance to reassess.\n“As we move out of the emergency response phase, do we put investments into the economy of the future, or do we put everything back to where it was?” said Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University.\nBut the pandemic could also induce the opposite response, by forcing people to take stock of their values and broader societal goals. For instance, the outbreak demonstrated how lifestyle changes can have an impact — however fleeting — on the environment. Countries under coronavirus lockdowns, such as China, Italy and the U.S., experienced unintended climate benefits such as declines in pollution and greenhouse gases as a result of reduced air travel, restrictions on movement within cities and significant slowdowns of industrial activities.\nWhile these climate benefits are only temporary, they did demonstrate what can happen even on short-term scales, according to Mann.\n“We can see in real time the impact that we can have on the environment if we choose to curtail certain type of activities,” he said.\nThe pandemic has also demonstrated the importance of cooperation among countries on matters of global importance. After all, climate change — like a virus — pays no regard to borders.\nMann maintains that though the post-coronavirus recovery will likely be challenging, the pandemic’s silver lining could be that it sets off efforts to protect the health and safety of people, their communities and the planet — similar to the citizen-led initiatives that surrounded the first Earth Day celebrations.\n“We have a real opportunity here for change,” he said. “As they say, it’s always darkest before dawn. We may see the tipping point we’ve all been waiting for on climate change action.”\nDoc 3(Title: \"Over the Last 43 Years Here's How Much Pollution We've Put Into the Air\") Over the Last 43 Years, Here's How Much Pollution We've Put Into the Air\nWhile pollution and its effect on climate change may be international problems, not all countries are equally at fault.\nDespite the changing international landscape and the rise of powerful industrial economies such in India and Russia, nearly half of the world's CO2 emissions can be squarely blamed on two countries: the U.S. and China.\nThe latter firmly cemented its leading status in 2007, although the U.S. emission levels are not looking any lower. Here is a map illustrating just how much CO2 emission these two countries dump on the rest of the world:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nCarbon emissions have been on the rise since 1971, with a steady annual increase of 2%. The global output is expected to rise by another 39% by 2030. In the U.S. alone, CO2 emissions have increased by 10% between 1999 and 2011.\nHow does that look compared to the rest of the world? Surprisingly enough, the global landscape of carbon emission has not changed much over the years. Here's a GIF simulating CO2 output in 1971:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nMost of the carbon emissions are concentrated in North America, Europe and East Asia, with the only noticeable outlier being South Africa.\nNow here is a version that illustrates how the carbon outputs look in 2011:\nImage Credit: The Atlantic Cities/visualizing.org\nThe most obvious increase is in China, which is covered by the CO2 clouds. Other countries that increased their presence on the map include Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India and Australia, while western Europe significantly cut down its output. But other than a few noticeable additions and eliminations, the distribution of carbon emission across the world looks remarkably similar to how it did back in 1971.\nIn pie chart form, it becomes even more telling just how much impact the U.S. and China's CO2 dump has on the rest of the world:\nImage Credit: EPA\nIn 2008, U.S. CO2 output was equal to India and 24 EU countries' combined output. As for China, it emitted as much CO2 as the U.S. and Japan combined.\nChina has been under a ton of pressure to deal with its insane air pollution problem, and it looks like its emissions may finally be slowing down. It's also drafting a comprehensive climate change bill to reform its energy policy. Chinese officials are considering a carbon tax, and by 2040, they want to reduce CO2 output by 40% of the 2005 levels.\nBut no matter how many doomsday scenarios are foretold, the U.S. remains frustratingly slow on curbing down carbon emission. Despite improved energy efficiency and increased popularity of alternative energy sources, the U.S. ended its recent CO2 decline streak with a 2% increase in 2013. But what can you expect from a country where politicians want to censor science and stop students from learning about climate change?\nDoc 4(Title: \"Air pollution over the last 50 years - Filtermist\") This year's World Environment Day on June 5th is focussing on Air Pollution and what can be done globally to reduce air pollution to help combat climate change.\nAir pollution is not a new problem – in fact, experts now know humans have been responsible for an increase in pollutants for at least 2,100 years. By extracting layers of ice which have accumulated in Greenland over many millennia and analysing the methane trapped within them, scientists have been able to link increased levels with activity we know civilisations such as the Ancient Romans and the Han Dynasty in China were undertaking at the time.\nDespite humans being aware of pollution for many decades (and having caused it for many more), our knowledge has grown exponentially over the last 50 years. So too have the efforts to reverse the trend by environmental groups, scientists, Governments and world leaders. Since Filtermist first began producing oil mist filters to help workplaces reduce their emissions in 1969, we have seen huge developments – but there are still regions of the world where pollution levels are increasing far above those acceptable as set down by legislation, and there are still individuals and employers who don’t comprehend the full scale of the problem and the negative impacts of pollutants like oil mist and dust.\nAir pollution is defined as a ‘mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both inside and outside’ – excess pollution has an impact on the environment (including contributing to rising temperatures across the globe) and humans too: through diseases caused by poor air quality. Hundreds of thousands of deaths each year are attributed to pollutants.\nIn this guide, we take a look at how emission levels, our knowledge and the regulations have changed in the past 50 years since Filtermist launched – and what could happen in the future if they are not reversed.\nEmissions over the years:\nThere are many different substances which class as air pollution when released into the atmosphere, including carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter (PM). The latter has been the primary concern of Filtermist since its inception 50 years ago, given this category includes oil mist particles which can be emitted as a by-product of various metal machining processes across multiple industries. PM can be divided into categories depending on the size of each individual particle: PM10 comprises of particles less than 10µm which can enter the lungs when inhaled, while PM2.5 can permeate the gas-exchange regions of the lungs and enter into the blood stream.\nSince the 1970s, the majority of countries have seen a decline in exposure to PM2.5, at least partially thanks to stricter regulations. But countries including India, China and Greece have all seen an increase3. In the UK, emissions have dropped significantly from 639,000 tonnes of PM10 and 498,000 tonnes of PM2.5 each year to 169,000 and 106,000 respectively.\nIn America, fewer than 20 per cent of city residents are exposed to PM10 and PM2.5 levels above the WHO Air Quality Guidelines. In higher-income countries in Europe, more than 60 per cent are exposed to higher levels, rising to more than 90 per cent when we look at lower- and middle-income European countries. However, the situation is worse in the Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, South-East Asia, and lower- and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific where between 95 and 100 per cent of cities are exposed to these above-guideline levels.\nIt’s not just a minor problem either, some of the cities are exposed to levels between six and ten times what the guidelines advise is acceptable.\nLevels have undoubtedly risen over the past 50 years, even when comparing data from a much shorter period (2008 to 2013) there is an eight per cent rise in annual mean concentrations of PM2.5. While high-income regions have seen a decrease, there has been a marked increase in pollution levels in low and medium-income regions.\nRegulations:\nDoc 5(Title: \"Timeline of Major Accomplishments in Transportation Air Pollution and ...\") Timeline of Major Accomplishments in Transportation, Air Pollution, and Climate Change\nAir pollution and cars were first linked in the early 1950’s by a California researcher who determined that pollutants from traffic was to blame for the smoggy skies over Los Angeles. At the time, typical new cars were emitting nearly 13 grams per mile hydrocarbons (HC), 3.6 grams per mile nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 87 grams per mile carbon monoxide (CO). Since then, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set standards to bring down levels of these pollutants, and the auto industry has responded by developing new emission control technologies.\nOver time, Congress authorized EPA to regulate emissions from other mobile sources of air pollution, such as heavy-duty trucks, agricultural and construction equipment, locomotives, lawn and garden equipment, and marine engines. These milestones in controlling emissions from mobile sources involve a variety of approaches including technological advances in engine design to higher quality fuels. This integrated approach to mobile source emission control also depends on extensive collaboration between EPA; vehicle, engine, and fuel manufacturers; state and local governments; transportation planners; and individual citizens.\n1970\nCongress passes the first major Clean Air Act, requiring a 90 percent reduction in emissions from new automobiles by 1975. President Richard Nixon establishes EPA, and the new agency is given it broad responsibility for regulating motor vehicle pollution. New cars must meet EPA emission standards for hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx). The law also directs EPA to set health-based \"National Ambient Air Quality Standards\" for six pollutants.\n1971\nEPA begins testing the fuel economy of cars, trucks, and other vehicles, the first step towards informing consumers about the gas mileage of their vehicles.\n1972\nExhaust gas recirculation valves are developed as automakers strive to meet NOx standards.\n1973\nEPA creates new transportation controls in some of the nation’s largest cities, including Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, and others. Measures include exclusive bus lanes, bypass lanes for carpools and buses, parking garages and restrictions, and a mass transit incentive plan for California employers.\nEPA releases a study confirming that lead from automobile exhaust poses a direct threat to public health. Later that year, EPA issues final regulations to gradually reducing lead in gasoline.\n1975\nCongress passes the Energy Policy Conservation Act, setting the first fuel economy goals. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program establishes a phase-in of more stringent fuel economy standards beginning with 1975 model vehicles.\nThe \"first generation\" catalytic converters are built, significantly reducing vehicle emissions. Unleaded gasoline is also introduced because lead in gasoline may cause disintegration of catalytic converters. This results in dramatic reductions in ambient lead levels and alleviates many serious environmental and human health concerns associated with lead pollution.\n1977\nCongress amends the Clean Air Act which set a schedule for continued reductions in emissions from automobiles.\n1981\nNew cars meet the amended Clean Air Act standards for the first time. Sophisticated three-way catalysts with on-board computers and oxygen sensors appear in most new cars, helping to optimize the efficiency of the catalytic converter.\n1983\nInspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs are established in areas with air pollution problems, requiring passenger vehicles to undergo periodic testing for malfunctioning emission control systems.\n1985\nEPA sets stringent standards for emissions of NOx from heavy-duty engines and of PM from heavy-duty diesel-powered trucks and buses.\nEPA issues final regulations to cut the amount of lead in gasoline by 90 percent starting January 1, 1986.

The rate of abuse among individuals with a history of abuse is approximately six times higher than the base rate for abuse in the general population. Although this suggests that being maltreated as a child is an important risk factor in the etiology of abuse, most maltreated children do not become abusive parents. Many mediating factors affect the likelihood of intergenerational abuse. Consequently, unqualified acceptance of the intergenerational hypothesis is unwarranted. 41 references.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Breaking the Cycle of Abuse | Psychology Today\") Child Development\nBreaking the Cycle of Abuse\nA five-part series on what you can do to break the cycle of abuse in your home.\nPosted June 7, 2020 Reviewed by Ekua Hagan\nWe live in a violent nation. The latest senseless killing of George Floyd seems to have united many to stand up against police violence against African Americans. But there is another cycle of violence we also need to focus on—the cycle of abuse in our homes.\nIf we ever hope to bring more peace into our world, we must start by ending the emotional, physical, and sexual violence that occurs in our homes. Having made the connection between childhood abuse and adult abuse and violence, we need only expand this knowledge to help us understand the violence that occurs in our communities.\nChildren who are neglected or abused in the home are far more likely to become either bullies in school or the victims of bullies. Many of the students who have taken up arms at school were found to have been the target of vicious bullying by their classmates. And we know that a majority of those in prison for violent crimes were either emotionally, physically, or sexually abused as children.\nThose who are mistreated perpetuate a culture of violence that affects us all. Therefore, the work we do on breaking the cycle of abuse in our own families will have even greater ramifications for society at large.\nEven though many people recognize the cyclical aspect of neglect and abuse, not enough is being done to break the cycle. Those who come from abusive or neglectful backgrounds are generally not offered courses or therapeutic programs that will help them to clear up the debris of their childhood before embarking on a new life with a husband or wife. Neither are there such programs for potential parents. Most programs are offered only to those who have already begun to abuse their spouse or their children.\nShame is a significant factor in the continuation of the cycle of abuse. It is not only one of the emotions that cause the cycle to continue but it often prevents people from getting help. It is time to stop blaming and shaming those who do to others what was done to them. It does no good to make monsters out of those who continue the cycle of violence by abusing their children or their partner. This only serves to harden them even more and make them less inclined to reach out for help.\nIt has become overwhelmingly clear that people don’t just “get over” child abuse. They continue to suffer and even more importantly, they pass on the abuse to other people. If you were emotionally, physically, or sexually abused as a child or adolescent, or if you experienced neglect or abandonment, it isn’t a question of whether you will continue the cycle of abuse or neglect, it is a question of how you will do so—whether you will become an abuser or continue to be a victim.\nAlthough this may sound unnecessarily negative to you, it is the truth. Research clearly shows that those who have been abused either absorb abuse or pass it on. In the past 25 years, studies on abuse and family assaults strongly suggest that abused children often become abusers themselves and that child victims of violence become violent adults. Individuals with a history of childhood abuse are four times more likely to assault family members or sexual partners than are individuals without such a history. Females who have a history of being abused in childhood are far more likely to continue being victimized as adults.\nBut we don’t need research to tell us what we know intuitively. If abuse and neglect were not passed down from generation to generation, we simply would not have the epidemic of childhood abuse and neglect we are experiencing today. “But I know plenty of people who were abused or neglected as children who did not grow up to be abusers or victims,” you might counter. Even though I’m sure there are a number of survivors you can think of who seem, on the surface, to be leading normal, healthy lives, I can assure you\nDoc 3(Title: \"Will children who get sexually abused become sexually abusive as teens ...\") Will children who get sexually abused become sexually abusive as teens or adults?\nThe vast majority of sexual abuse survivors live their lives without ever sexually abusing others.\nWhat percentage of child victims of sexual abuse become abusive?\nAlthough adults who have sexually abused a child are more likely to have been sexually abused as a child [3], children and teens who have been sexually abused are no more likely to sexually abuse someone else [8]. One way to look at this is to consider that in actuality, female children are more often sexually abused than male children [4], yet over 90% of people who sexually abuse children are male [6]. Also, even though some kids who hurt others have been hurt themselves, many have not been abused [7].\nWhy do children who sexually abuse sometimes become abusive?\nThere are many reasons why a child might act out sexually, such as problems controlling their impulses, seeing inappropriate material, having a disability, or dealing with stress at home or in their environment [5]. Primarily, when a person is exposed to traumas in childhood, they are more likely to have difficulties in other areas of their lives as they grow into adults, like relationships, safety, decision making, mental health, and physical wellbeing [1, 2].\nHow to ensure children who have been sexually abused do not abuse others.\nIntervention - help and support - is crucial after a child has been abused. Acknowledging and addressing the distress a child has experienced is the way to begin ending this abusive cycle and to helping a child recover. Experts and parents agree that with specialized treatment children who have been sexually abused can heal, and do not pose a risk to other children - now or later in life.\nLearn More\n- Treatment and Support Resources for Children and Parents\n- Children and Youth with Sexual Behavior Problems\n- When a Child Tells About Sexual Abuse\nReturn to FAQs\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nReferences\n[1] Almuneef, M.

Even though I’m sure there are a number of survivors you can think of who seem, on the surface, to be leading normal, healthy lives, I can assure you that there are many things that go on behind closed doors that the average bystander never knows about.\nIf you could be a fly on the wall, you might see the cycle of abuse being repeated in the way a husband talks to his wife in the same dismissive, condescending tone in which his father spoke to his mother or in the way his wife passively concedes to her husband’s demands, just as her mother did. You might see it in the way one or both parents has an inordinate need to dominate and control their children. Or, one or both parents may repeat the cycle by neglecting their children in much the same way they were neglected, by constantly putting their own needs before those of their children, not paying attention to or being affectionate toward their children, or being emotionally or physically unavailable to their children because they are abusing alcohol or drugs.\nIf one spouse was physically abused as a child, you would likely see that kind of abuse repeated as well. Even the most well-meaning person will find himself or herself exploding in the same kind of rages he or she witnessed or experienced as a child. His rage is likely to surface when he drinks too much, when he feels provoked, or when he is reminded of, or “triggered” by memories of his own abuse. Or, the reverse may be true: If she was battered as a child or witnessed her mother being abused she may have grown up to marry a man who physically abuses her or her children. She will be rendered helpless—unable to defend herself or to leave, just as her mother before her.\nMany people who were abused or neglected in childhood know that there is a risk that they may become abusive or neglectful themselves unless they take definitive steps to prevent it. But not everyone knows the more subtle legacies of abuse and neglect. For example, those with such a history often view their children or partner through a distorted lens of fear, distrust, anger, pain, and shame. They see ridicule, rejection, betrayal, and abandonment when it really isn’t there. Their low self-esteem may cause them to be hypersensitive and to take things far too personally. And they will likely have control issues causing them to either have a need to dominate others or to be far too easily dominated by others. Those who become parents often find it difficult to see their own children’s needs and pain without being reminded of their own. And they may also find it difficult to allow their children to make a mistake without taking it as a personal affront or a sign that they are not a good parent.\nThink about the way the abuse or neglect has affected the way you view yourself and others. What kind of a legacy are you going to pass on to your children? While these may be depressing or even frightening thoughts, there is a way out of the seemingly endless cycle of abuse and neglect. There are ways to make up for the personality deficits that often accompany experiences of neglect and abuse. There are ways for you to confront your pain, anger, fear, and shame directly so you do not have to transfer it to your partner or your children.\nBased on the information in my book, Breaking the Cycle: Moving Beyond Your Past to Create an Abuse-Free Future, I will be offering a five-part series that can help those of you who experienced neglect or abuse as a child to break the cycle once and for all. It is possible to transform the legacy of pain into a legacy of hope.\nReferences\nEngel, Beverly (2005) Breaking the Cycle of Abuse: Moving Beyond Your Past to Create an Abuse-Free Future.

So sometimes, although you don't have any particular worries you can recognize off the top of your head, your body reminds you that you're still anxious underneath it all. The physical symptoms of anxiety can show up any time, even when you least expect it.\nWhile you may consider anxiety to be all about your thoughts, it's actually a pretty full-body experience. So even when you aren't having a particularly stressful day or night, anxiety can still be present in your system. \"Anxiety is a highly physiological experience,\" Joshua Klapow, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and host of The Kurre and Klapow Show, tells Bustle. \"So many of the symptoms of anxiety can intertwine physical, cognitive and emotional experiences. It’s not uncommon for people experiencing anxiety to not be aware or not link what they are experiencing to that of being anxious because the experience is so physiological.\" Treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy may be able to help you find the connection between your thoughts and your feelings, but you can also start by better understanding what physical symptoms may be connected to feelings of distress.\nExperiences like panic attacks can be more obvious, but anxiety's daily symptoms are sometimes so subtle that you may not interpret them correctly right away. Luckily, these symptoms are well-studied, so a psychologist can help you identify what may not be obvious at first.\nHere are 10 physical ways anxiety can manifest itself, even when you're not feeling stressed, according to experts.\n1You Might Grind Your Teeth\nIf you've ever woken up in the morning with a tight jaw, or had a dentist mention you might grind your teeth, you may be experiencing a common but less-obvious symptom of anxiety.\n\"People can grind their teeth when they don't know they're anxious at night,\" Terry Eagan, M.D., chief psychiatric officer at Alsana, tells Bustle. If you want to stop grinding your teeth, you can either buy anti-teeth-grinding products, or try anxiety treatment methods, or both.\n2You May Have Difficulty Breathing\nIf you've ever noticed yourself having trouble breathing, even when you don't seem particularly stressed, then you may be experiencing symptoms of anxiety.\n\"Another physical symptom is rapid [or] shallow breathing (hyperventilation),\" licensed clinical social worker Sheilah Ledesma, owner of Lighter Living Counseling, tells Bustle. \"Even when a person is not feeling stressed in that moment, they can become a victim of this physical symptom.\" If you are dealing with unresolved anxiety, this may be more likely. Your body may be warning you that you have some underlying issues to deal with.\n3You May Sweat More Than Usual\nNervous sweating doesn't just happen before a big speech or another stressful event. You can experience this symptom of anxiety even when you're feeling relatively calm.\n\"A person can start sweating out profusely even when nothing stressful or anxious is happening,\" Ledesma says. \"This is evidence that there is a build up of anxiety that has not been addressed. The body is so accustomed to sending anxious signals to the brain and the body responds by releasing cortisol, the stress hormone.\" Since this may be another sign that you may not be properly addressing your anxiety, you might want to seek professional help if this happens often.\n4You May Wake Up A Lot In The Night\nIf you've ever woken up in the night with a racing heart, even if you went to bed feeling fine, then you may be dealing with a physical symptom of anxiety.\n\"This physical response could be due to that person's anxious neural pathways that have been created over time,\" Ledesma says. \"The brain is powerful enough to recognize a person's thought patterns, and overtime will be conditioned to respond anxiously even when a person is not stressed.\" Finding a therapist who can address your anxiety\nDoc 2(Title: \"10 Physical Ways Anxiety Can Manifest Itself Even When You're Not ...\") however, seeking professional support may be a helpful step.\nUnfortunately, a lot of these physical signs of anxiety become apparent when anxiety goes untreated for a while. Learning to accept that stress and anxiety aren't personal failures may help you ease your symptoms. \"When we consider stress 'bad,' we actually become more stressed by the presence of stress symptoms, creating a cycle of stress we seek to avoid,\" licensed marriage and family therapist Carrie Krawiec, tells Bustle. Instead, recognizing that stress and anxiety are important ways that your body protects you, may help you forgive yourself and feel more willing to find treatment to mitigate it — not eradicate these feelings completely.\nDoc 3(Title: \"10 Physical Ways Anxiety Can Manifest Itself Even When You're Not ...\") o that person's anxious neural pathways that have been created over time,\" Ledesma says. \"The brain is powerful enough to recognize a person's thought patterns, and overtime will be conditioned to respond anxiously even when a person is not stressed.\" Finding a therapist who can address your anxiety, and perhaps focusing on clean sleeping, may prevent this from happening too often.\n5You May Make Repetitive Movements\nYou may feel like these are totally harmless habits, but tapping a pen, shaking your leg, or doing other repetitive movements could be a sign of anxiety — even if you aren't feeling stressed.\n\"[People with anxiety may] wring hands, pace, shake a leg or tap a foot,\" Dr. Klapow says. \"All of this is driven by our brain prepping the body for defense.\" Since anxiety puts your body into \"fight-or-flight\" mode, this can be a sign of your body reacting to anxiety in a very innate way. If you notice you have a repetitive habit you can't shake, it may be worth examining whether it could be tied to anxiety.\n6You May Eat Or Speak More Quickly\nJust like anxiety can cause racing thoughts, it can also speed up some of your physical processes as well.\n\"People can eat and speak more quickly even when they aren't aware,\" Eagan says. Being more mindful throughout the day may help you slow down when you notice yourself potentially being anxious, and having trouble regulating your pace.\n7You May Have Digestive Issues\nEven if you aren't thinking about anything stressful, your body switching into \"fight-or-flight\" mode can still cause all sorts of physical symptoms — including digestive upset.\n\"During the activation of the 'fight-or-flight' system, the body's ability to digest food properly decreases,\" licensed clinical social worker and licensed clinical addictions specialist, Lauren Moser Vilar, tells Bustle. \"[...] However, if we are constantly anxious our bodies do not properly digest and excrete our food intake.\" If you've noticed a change in your digestion, talking to a doctor is an important step for both your physical and mental health. Anxiety and the gut are closely linked.\n8You May Feel More Tired Than Usual\nOne reason that you may experience physical symptoms of anxiety even when you aren't stressed is because the symptoms can build up over time. And when this happens, you may begin to feel quite tired.\n\"The sympathetic system, or 'fight-or-flight' system, is very active even if you aren’t consciously aware of the work your body is doing,\" Moser Vilar says. \"Over time, the underlying anxiety can create exhaustion and fatigue.\" If you've noticed a change in your energy level, it's important to reach out to a doctor or therapist for help.\n9Your Shoulder And Neck May Feel Tense\nShoulder and neck tension are classic anxiety symptoms. If you have been dealing with anxiety for a while, this tension can become a painful physical issue even when you aren't feeling stressed.\n\"Over time, the muscle tension that we experience from stress builds up and can create neck cramps and stiff shoulders,\" Moser Vilar says. Both physical and psychological remedies may be able to ease this tension.\n10You May Feel Like You're Having An \"Out Of Body\" Experience\nDissociation can be a scary word. But if you've ever felt like you're having an \"out of body experience,\" or simply felt \"off\" for a bit, you may be experiencing a physical response to anxiety.\n\"An example of a 'flight' response might be difficulty concentrating or feeling like we're detached from ourselves, as if detaching our body from our emotions will help us survive the perceived threat,\" licensed professional counselor Julie Williamson, tells Bustle. If you notice a pattern of this sensation, however, seeking professional support may be a helpful step.\nUnfortunately, a lot of these physical signs of anxiety become apparent when anxiety goes untreated for a while. Learning to accept that stress and anxiety aren't personal failures may help you ease your symptoms. \"When we consider stress\nDoc 4(Title: \"Mental Health Awareness Certificate - New Skills Academy\") Mental Health Awareness Certificate\nMental Health Awareness Certificate Course\nAccording to the mental health charity Mind, one in four adults experience a mental health problem every year and one in six experience a mental health issue each week.

    "question": "how does solitary confinement violate rights",
    "agent_answer": "From the information gathered, it is clear that solitary confinement violates multiple human rights, particularly the right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment (as per the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 12), the right to freedom and liberty (s. 7), and the right to protection against arbitrary detention (s. 9). The practice can cause severe psychological harm, including depression, anxiety, and even permanent damage to mental health. It is also argued that the use of solitary confinement is excessive and disproportionate, and there are no sufficient safeguards to prevent its misuse.\n\n<answer> Solitary confinement violates rights such as the right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, the right to freedom and liberty, and the right to protection against arbitrary detention.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> Solitary confinement involves isolating an individual from any form of human contact for long periods, typically 22 to 24 hours a day. This practice has been known to have significant psychological impacts on individuals. It's important to consider which rights this practice might violate.</think>\n\nSolitary confinement can violate several rights:\n\n1. **Right to Human Interaction**: Humans are social beings, and prolonged isolation can lead to severe psychological distress, including depression and anxiety.\n2. **Right to Freedom**: While not absolute, freedom from arbitrary detention is a fundamental right, and solitary confinement can be seen as a form of harsh punishment that goes beyond what is necessary.\n3. **Right to Privacy**: Although privacy is important, the extreme isolation in solitary confinement can be argued to overstep reasonable bounds.\n\nTo gain more insight into specific legal or international perspectives on this issue, I should search for relevant information.\n\n<search> how solitary confinement violates human rights </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Solitary confinement violates basic rights. Why does ...\") Debra Parkes is associate dean, research and graduate studies, in the law faculty at the University of Manitoba.\nMedia attention surrounding the deaths of Edward Snowshoe and Ashley Smith, who spent months or years in solitary confinement, is making it increasingly difficult for Canadians to ignore this human-rights crisis.\nThe damaging effects of solitary confinement (or segregation, as it's called in Canada) are well known. A United Nations body recently called for states to prohibit solitary for young people and people with mental illness, indeed, for anyone for more than 15 days. Yet segregation is widespread in Canadian prisons. Its use is normalized, routine and increasing, with no enforced limits.\nLast month, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published an editorial calling for an end to solitary confinement, noting that elements of psychiatric damage – anxiety, depression, perceptual distortions, paranoia and psychosis – are often evident after even a few days in solitary. Some of these effects can become permanent, particularly when the isolation is prolonged. Solitary exacerbates pre-existing medical conditions and creates new ones, including insomnia, anorexia and palpitations. The damage contributes to a variety of harms: self-injury, lashing out at correctional staff and other prisoners, suicide, inability to cope in society upon release. Solitary is harmful and counterproductive to public safety.\nGiven this mounting evidence and the growing consensus that solitary confinement violates basic human rights, why is it being employed so widely in Canada? And perhaps more importantly, what can be done to reverse this trend?\nAnnual reports of Canada's Correctional Investigator, along with a host of other studies in the federal context, show that the vast majority of segregation placements are for \"administrative,\" not disciplinary, reasons. Solitary confinement is a tool of population management and its widespread use hinders the development of more productive means of making our institutions and communities safer.\nAt the provincial and territorial level, we know little about the extent and reasons for solitary because information about the practice is generally not made public. However, records obtained through Access to Information in Manitoba revealed many provincial segregation placements for which no legal justification was recorded or where the reason was said to be \"overflow,\" a basis not authorized in law.\nAt a basic level, solitary is widely used because no one is compelling correctional authorities to do anything different. In provincial and territorial systems where independent oversight is limited, there is no incentive to change, particularly as prison populations keep growing under tough-on-crime legislation. Federally, there is no shortage of reports documenting the damage done by solitary and chronicling the failure to act on the many recommendations for reining in the practice made by task forces, commissions of inquiry and other independent bodies.\nWhat we do not need are more correctional rules and policy around segregation. As Justice Louise Arbour wrote in her 1996 inquiry report into unlawful uses of force and prolonged segregation at the Prison for Women in Kingston, \"the rule of law is absent, although rules are everywhere.\" The Globe and Mail's investigation indicates that correctional law and policy concerning segregation were breached in Edward Snowshoe's case, as they were in Ashley Smith's.\nWhat is needed then is independent external oversight and enforcement of existing law and rights. An important first step would be for Canada to ratify the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which would require Canada to have a \"national preventative mechanism\" to inspect all places of detention to ensure compliance with international human-rights standards. This would provide a measure of accountability and information to the public about the use of solitary confine\nDoc 2(Title: \"Abuse Of The Human Rights Of Prisoners In The United ...\") document\nAbuse Of The Human Rights Of Prisoners In The United States: Solitary Confinement\nDocument Date:\nFebruary 23, 2011\nDownload document\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) urges the Human Rights Council to address the widespread violations of the human rights of prisoners in the United States associated with solitary confinement and call for the adoption of appropriate measures to protect their human rights. The ACLU calls on the Council to urge the United States to take concrete and appropriate measures to end the egregious violations stemming from solitary confinement of prisoners.\nDoc 3(Title: \"ACLU to United Nations: Solitary Confinement Violates ...\") The ACLU's Amy Fettig appeared before the U.N. Human Rights Council today to condemn the use of solitary confinement in the United States, following a written statement we submitted last month urging the Council to address this widespread violation of human rights. Also appearing today was Juan Mendez, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, who has said before that solitary confinement can amount to torture and today called for a review and reduction of the use of solitary confinement as a matter of human rights. Mendez has also called on the United States to allow him to visit to investigate the use solitary confinement in U.S. supermax prisons; the U.S. has yet to respond.\nThe U.S. is unique among nations in its use of solitary confinement as an integral and regular component of its treatment of prisoners. Though there are no official numbers, a conservative estimate is that about 80,000 human beings are locked alonefor 22 hours or more each day in small, often windowless cells, isolated from any human contact (with the exception of very limited contact with prison staff), with no access to classes, job training, drug treatment, work or any other kind of rehabilitative programming. The mentally ill, disproportionately represented in solitary confinement, often become even more desperately ill, sometimes engaging in self-mutilation or even suicide. Even some healthy prisoners begin to exhibit symptoms of mental illness after a short time in solitary. Thousands of youth are also locked away in this manner each day, in both adult and juvenile facilities.\nThe use of solitary confinement in the U.S. is an urgent and pervasive problem deserving of the world stage and worldwide condemnation. The U.S. should implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, but greater global attention and action will be needed to ensure this nation’s use of solitary confinement is consistent with international human rights standards.\nLearn more about solitary confinement: Sign up for breaking news alerts, follow us on Twitter, and like us on Facebook.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Solitary Confinement is a Human Rights Issue\") Mahatma Ghandi once said: “A nation’s greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members.” Canada has used solitary confinement for prisoners for decades. In the past several years, solitary confinement has been the subject of criticism from civil libertarians and mental health advocates.\nUsually, solitary confinement involves isolating inmates in a small cell without human contact for 22 hours per day. Often called “administrative segregation”, solitary confinement has been the subject of increased scrutiny because of suicides and mental health issues suffered by prisoners who may be held for years in isolation. In A Sourcebook on Solitary Confinement, Dr. Sharon Shalev (2008), a leading international authority on solitary confinement, states that between one-third and 90% of prisoners experience some negative impacts of long-term solitary confinement. The symptoms may include insomnia, confusion, feelings of hopelessness and despair, distorted perceptions and hallucinations.\nFor over 20 years, the Correctional Investigator has criticized the overuse of solitary confinement in Canada. For example, see the Annual Report of the Office of the Correctional Investigator 2014-2015 (Annual Report, 2014-2015). The Correctional Investigator notes that solitary confinement is overused particularly for women with mental health issues, and for Indigenous and Black inmates.\nThe practice of administrative segregation is now called “Structured Intervention”.\nIn 1992, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, SC 1992, c 20 (CCRA), originally provided procedural safeguards for administrative segregation in sections 31 to 37. These may be summarized as:\n- Release from administrative segregation at the earliest appropriate time.\n- Reasonable alternatives to administrative segregation must first be explored and exhausted.\n- Inmates in administrative segregation have the same rights as those in the general inmate population, except those that cannot be exercised due to limitations specific to administrative segregation or security requirements.\n- The Correctional Service Canada shall take into consideration an offender’s state of health and health care needs in all administrative segregation decisions (Annual Report, 2014-2015).\nThere are also international guidelines called the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (also called the Nelson Mandela Rules). Rules 43 to 45:\n- prohibit indefinite or prolonged solitary confinement (over 15 days);\n- provide that solitary confinement is to be used only exceptionally; and\n- prohibit use for prisoners with mental or physical health disabilities that will be exacerbated by it.\nWhile not legally binding, Canadian courts will turn to these rules for guidance.\nIn British Columbia Civil Liberties Association v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 BCCA 228, the B.C. Court of Appeal considered whether solitary confinement violates a person’s s. 7 Charter right to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The Court confirmed that the 1992 CCRA provisions authorizing indefinite and prolonged solitary confinement, and internal rather than external review of decisions to segregate inmates in solitary confinement, violated these rights. The Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for one year.\nFor over 20 years, the Correctional Investigator has criticized the overuse of solitary confinement in Canada.In Canadian Civil Liberties Association v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 ONCA 243, the Ontario Court of Appeal provided, among others, that the CCRA provisions permitting administrative segregation for over 15 consecutive days violated a person’s s. 12 Charter right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. The Court found the violation could not be saved by s. 1 of the Charter (reasonable and justifiable violations).\nThe Supreme Court of Canada recently granted leave to the feder\nDoc 5(Title: \"Solitary Confinement is a Human Rights Issue\") regation for over 15 consecutive days violated a person’s s. 12 Charter right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. The Court found the violation could not be saved by s. 1 of the Charter (reasonable and justifiable violations).\nThe Supreme Court of Canada recently granted leave to the federal government to appeal these two cases (jointly). (See February 13, 2020 case nos. 38574 and 38814.)\nSections 31 to 37 of the CCRA were amended in November 2019. The practice of administrative segregation is now called “Structured Intervention”. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association notes:\nThese [structured Intervention] units continue to house inmates in situations of extreme isolation, however inmates are now supposed to be provided four hours daily out of cell and (or including) two hours daily of meaningful human contact, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. In addition, after hearing from CCLA and others, the law now includes a system of independent decision-makers to review decisions concerning keeping inmates in the SIUs, to consider their conditions, and to review the situation of people with mental health issues in the SIUs. The new law also addresses certain mental health supports and supports for Indigenous inmates.\nHowever, prisoner’s advocates argue that these amendments do not adequately address the concerns about solitary confinement. For example, the new provisions do not set a time limit on solitary confinement. Thus, the federal government did not adequately address concerns about the harms. Advocates do not believe a new name is adequate to address the consequences of the practice of solitary confinement. (See: J. Bronskill, (13 Feb 2020) National Post “Supreme Court of Canada to examine solitary confinement in federal prisons”.)\nMany inmates return to society eventually. It is in all of our interests to ensure they do not suffer irreversible harms while in indefinite solitary confinement.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information gathered, it is clear that solitary confinement violates multiple human rights, particularly the right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment (as per the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 12), the right to freedom and liberty (s. 7), and the right to protection against arbitrary detention (s. 9).

This reality didn’t just inform their thinking; it informed their living. Their theology invaded every aspect of African American identity.\nWhen Protten traveled the rough roads of the island of Antigua, her life would be the catalyst for the life of Sojourner Truth, the slave woman turned evangelist champion for the end of slavery. When Allen decided to walk out of the dark clouds of segregation and into the sunshine of racial justice, his life would be a catalyst for the young Martin Luther King Jr. who would do the same. When Lee had the courage to stand up and proclaim God’s truth despite being a woman, her life would be a catalyst for the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, who would always say, “You have to step out and trust God.” They gave birth to what we know as black Christianity today.\nThis strong tradition gave a people hope that God would act to provide justice for enslaved Africans and all who were oppressed. It was this faith that gave African Americans the arguments against the religion of the slaveholders. It gave a people a profound sense of dignity, identity, and significance, which led the church to be the most enduring and shaping institution in the African American story.\nAuthor Juan Williams writes that “individual black people took on a cloak of faith, an unshakable belief that God would carry them through slavery and lift them up to freedom.” They transformed themselves into “Christian soldiers, marching for an end to segregation and for the promise of equality as God’s children … then they transformed the church.” Much more, they transformed Christianity as we know it. It would do us well to not only listen to these stories of the past and be transformed by them in the present. May God make it so.\nDante Stewart is a student at Reformed Theological Seminary.

The Chattanooga-based American Rights Coalition, whose Ten Commandments displays dot lawns in Sullivan County, found that fewer than 1% of adults and teens in conservative, Bible-focused churches could list them. Other studies suggest less than 10% of evangelicals have read the Bible fully. Itâs worth considering how one embraces a âliteralistâ stance without knowing the text.\nSomething feels amiss in parts of todayâs Christian community. Compassion for the poor can wane, political fervor often overshadows Scripture, and critiques of scienceâbiology, physics, geologyâfill books, while Jesusâ teachings get less mention. Shifts toward intense views, alternative spiritualities, or silence from traditional leaders prompt reflection. As a classical Deist, I see value in separating historical Christianity from these newer currents, a theme Iâve explored elsewhere (Unitarians, creationism).\nProtestant Christianity splits broadly into two perspectives. One sees Jesusâ sacrifice as a profound act of love and forgiveness, reflecting his messageâa view tied to civil rights and a hopeful outlook, often more open on social issues. The other frames humans as inherently flawed, under a stern God swift to judge, drawing from Genesisâ Flood or Sodom. Some here push strict penalties, emphasizing faith over Jesusâ words, leaning on Paul, Revelation, and the Old Testament. Their lens can be narrower, anticipating a divine reckoning.\nAmerican Christianity ebbs and flows, marked by change. Early settlers brought parish churchesâCongregational and Episcopalianâfrom England. By the mid-1700s, before the Revolution, a shift unfolded. Calvinismâs stern, arbitrary God clashed with a more approachable one, rewarding those who lived by Scripture. Baptists and Methodists gained ground over Episcopalians and Congregationalists, favoring a personal faith.\nThis was Calvinism versus Arminianismâa debate over grace and choice. Rational faith, like Unitarianism and Deism, appealed to thinkers and the educated, including founders Iâve written about (here), though it spoke less to everyday folks. The Second Awakening (1820-1835) brought âborn againâ fervorâtent revivals and circuit riders swelled Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian ranks. Irish and German Catholics later enriched the mix, alongside homegrown faiths (more here).\nChristians debate âtraditional Christianityâ endlessly, each claiming the true path. The Apostlesâ and Nicene Creeds, shared by Protestants and Catholics, offer a baselineâthough some question their origins. Around 1920, mainline Protestants outlined key beliefs: Scriptureâs authority, Jesusâ return, virgin birth, resurrection, atonement, and human sinfulness. These differ from todayâs fundamentalism.\nâScriptural inerrancyâ here means the Bibleâs whole message, not word-for-word rigidity. The resurrection accounts vary in detail but affirm the eventâmuch of itâs allegory, like Jesusâ parables, not history or science. The Old Testament, too, isnât literal for Christians; New Testament writers saw it symbolically, guided by faith. Compare Deuteronomy 6:4-5 and Mark 12:29-30 across versionsâtranslations shift, yet the call to love God remains. These nuances fuel discussion.\nMichael Hortonâs The Agony of Deceit (1990) notes a Protestant pitfall: âprivate interpretationâ doesnât mean any reading holds. Scripture aligns within itselfâconflicting claims canât both stand. The Reformation upheld core doctrinesâTrinity, Christâs nature, atonementâshared across traditions, despite disputes over structure or style. Gnosticismâs early sway, seeking direct divine insight, lingers in claims like Pat Robertsonâs tidal wave warnings or Oral Robertsâ fundraising pleasâpersonal revelations Horton calls âsevere errorâ (Nicaeaâs response).\nGnostic echoes in John, Revelation, and Paul (here) shaped early faithâworth understanding, not dismissing. Education c\nDoc 5(Title: \"Why the Enslaved Adopted the Religion ... - Christianity Today\") ed a “reformation”? Author Juan Williams argues indeed it can be. In his book on African American religious history, This Far By Faith, Williams writes, “Africans did not simply adopt the religion of the European Colonist; they used the power, principles, and practices of Christianity to blaze a path to freedom and deliverance.” Not only did they blaze a path but the path was so big that he concludes that “it reformed Christian theology” as well as Christianity itself.\nRebecca Protten, ‘Mother of the Black Reformation’\nThough the process had long begun, in the 1730s, the birth of one of the earliest African Protestant churches found pivotal momentum in a seemingly unlikely place: the rugged roads through the hills of St. Thomas, a Danish sugar colony in the West Indies, known to the enslaved as “The Path.” Though kept from popular nightly meetings due to violent animosity, black men and women would press their way along these rugged roads to hear the gospel from an unlikely missionary: a brave young woman. She would not be just the “Mother of Modern Missions” but also the “Mother of the Black Reformation.” Her name was Rebecca Protten.\nBorn a slave in 1718 and kidnapped at an early age from the island of Antigua, she was converted as a young woman. Protten would eventually gain her freedom and join a group of German missionaries from the Moravian Church in 1736. Freidrich Martin, a Moravian missionary, wrote that Protten had done “the work of the Savior by teaching … and speaking.” Protten didn’t just give her voice to the mission of God; she gave her life. Jon Sensbach notes in his book Rebecca’s Revival that she would trudge “daily along rugged roads through the hills in the sultry evenings after the slaves had returned from the fields.”\nShe was more than a teacher; she was a mentor. She was “a prophet, determined to take what she regarded as the Bible’s liberating grace to people of African descent.” She took her message near and far by carrying it directly to the people. Her travels “took her to the slave quarters deep in the island’s plantation heartland, where she proclaimed salvation to the domestic servants, cane boilers, weavers, and cotton pickers whose bodies and spirits were strip-mined every day by slavery.”\nAs she and others took the gospel from plantation to plantation “St. Thomas suddenly became the Americas’ new axis of Afro-Protestant conversion.” Fueled by the message of liberating grace, they put “themselves at the forefront of an indigenous black movement that was birthed in the slave quarters.”\nSensbach concludes, “much that we associate with the black church in subsequent centuries—the anchor of community life, advocate for social justice, midwife to spirituals and gospel music—in some measure derives … from those early origins.” This Reformation spirit found its home in two women and two men.\nFreedom’s Prophet: Richard Allen and The Black Reformation\n“If I could write but a part of my labors, it would fill a volume.”\nThese were the words of Bishop Richard Allen in his spiritual autobiography Life, Experiences, and Gospel Labors.\nBorn into slavery in 1760, Richard Allen went on to become a leading American reformer, wrote many pamphlets of protest that would be the model for many generations to come. A pastor who was a contemporary of Allen’s called him one of the most “talented people of his generation.” Another dubbed him “The Apostle of Freedom.” Allen’s other contemporaries agreed. His life would be celebrated and would inspire the likes of the pioneering abolitionist Frederick Douglass, famed abolitionist David Walker, and great sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois.\nAt the age of 17, Allen “got religion” and converted to Methodism. His passion was undeniable. He would begin and end each day with prayer. Allen believed he had an important place in God’s mission. As one biographer shares, “The Lord looked for young Richard Allen, a slave, and Allen professed to be the Lord’s undying servant.” Allen joined St.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, Thoreau's influence on Martin Luther King Jr. is not explicitly detailed.

And, we saw the commensurate rise in academic achievement through this pathway and that was really the genesis point.\nWhat germinated out of that became after school supports and cultural practices, and customs to tutoring were then formally adopted by community-based organizations (CBO) that were operated and led by the community. And, these eventually morphed into formalized educational school settings.\n[00:16:05] Kelly Young: Josh [Schachter], I would love for you to share about ecosystems and what is necessary to create a learning ecosystem.\n[00:16:38] Josh Schachter: When you don’t have an ecosystem, essentially what it means is you’re in isolation from each other as many of us are experiencing right now with COVID and other things. When I was teaching photography to refugee and immigrant youth, the first semester I asked the students to photograph what it means to have a home, or to feel at home, or to come from a different home.\nOver a semester, they wrote and they photographed, and almost every image they came back with was of isolation and disconnection from their community (48 out of 50 students photographed that). And, thinking that the prompt was, “what does it mean to have a home.” and that was the response—isolation and disconnection—was deeply disturbing to my colleague and I.\nWhat we decided was to really shift our focus, to look at the passions and the projects our students wanted to focus on and match them with the community members who also share that passion. For me, really thinking [about learning] as an ecosystem is looking at how we build relationships. Ecosystems are about living relationships and looking at how you see the potential in relationships that exist or the ones that aren’t equally accessible in an ecosystem.\nTo speak to the role of the community, we invited our city council member to see the photos because she needed to understand her own constituents. And, she was so moved. She said, “Let’s have an exhibit of their work in my office.” And, we partnered to create an exhibit and then she said, “You know what, let’s make a book.”\nSo, we made a book of their photos, and then our Congressman got invited to the exhibit in Tucson and he said, “These are pretty powerful images that speak to what’s happening in our society, but Tucson isn’t the place. This needs to be seen. It needs to go to D.C.” Then, we partnered with Senator McCain’s Office and worked with other organizations that brought it to the United States Senate. Then, our students went out and testified in the U.S. House of Representatives about re-imagining refugee and immigration policy.\nThat [all] started with a relatively simple question about what it means to have a home and what is the ecosystem that exists in that home that is either invisible or inaccessible. And then, how do you reveal and connect those in ways that are equitable to all teachers and students in that community? That’s what it enabled for our students and for me, as a learner, to learn. We also partnered with different policy professionals in D.C. because we didn’t know how to present a policy recommendation to Congress.\nThat was on a whole new level—the role the community [can play]. We needed to have the humility to know we didn’t have to know e\nDoc 3(Title: \"How to Leverage Community Assets for Powerful Learning ...\") he project.\n[00:10:12] Kelly Young: Joe [Hobot], I want to turn to you next. When we first spoke, you shared a story about how schools you visited actually got their start by doing after school programming and engaging the community. And, I’m wondering if you could share one of the stories of why engaging the community led to an alternative design for education.\n[00:10:47] Joe Hobot: In my journey as an educator and in these sites that I was lucky enough to visit in 2017 with the National Urban Indian Family Coalition, it really acknowledged a crisis point in our youth and their educational processes.\nWhat we were taught by our elders and what we’ve come to learn about the history of public education really was informative to the practice and the work, and a reality check of what we’re contending with. Where these schools emerged from was an understanding that public education really isn’t about the development of critical thinkers. At least not in its original design.\nThis is particularly true for Indigenous peoples where education and public education was weaponized against us to rob us of our culture. And, as we began to really dig into the history of public education and that space architecture: it’s really predicated on assimilation and acculturation into a prefabricated identity known as being an American, which was ostensibly done to support the burgeoning Republic of the United States.\nFor us, that meant we were subjugated to the adage of “kill the savage and save the man.” And, we were forced into an assimilative pattern that didn’t match our belief systems, our religious beliefs, or our traditional customs as Indigenous people. As we move forward into the 21st century, we’ve come to understand the purpose of education as its original architecture suggests, which is a tool of supporting and furthering white supremacy.\nThis was absolutely incongruent with who we were as American Indian people. So, into this crisis came our elders, and we looked at these departure points of our youth who were not necessarily failing in a public education system but through this recast vision [that was incongruent with their cultural upbringing]. They were making a spirit-saving choice to exit a system that was noxious and toxic to who they were as Indian people.\nBut, there was nothing there to receive them. And, in the various locations that I’ve had the opportunity to visit and travel to that fueled the work that I did in 2017, the elders came forward and said, first and foremost, we need to reassert and reinstitute our cultural practices and ideas of being Indigenous people into our youth.\nThey’re lost. They’ve been divorced from these very important teachings and lessons about how to live in community with one another. And, so it began as a supportive structure for wayward youth that were really twisting in the breeze without any real direction and certainly not having a responsive public education system to their needs. The education system was really trying to force a square peg into a round hole.\nWe saw a lot of after school work and weekend work of learning about various Indigenous practices in all these different communities that have been separated by thousands of miles: the importance of the drum, the song, song creation, song meanings, creation stories—ceremonial practices that were tied to the land and the water of the local areas.\nThis last point was hugely important for the urban Indigenous population, which is far larger and diverse than most people recognize as a result of federal policies in the 1950’s. What we found, and what the elders shared when they started to implement these works by bringing in the youth to teach them their culture, is that things began to stabilize. The youth had a different approach and an opinion about their place in the world, their place as American Indian people within this country, and their roles and responsibilities to support their community along the way.\nOne of the stories was in Port\nDoc 4(Title: \"Racial Discrimination | Country Page | World | Human ...\") Chief Egunwale Amusan, Descendant of Tulsa Massacre SurvivorWhat’s the big deal about Tulsa?

Culture is a broad term that is used to refer to the set customs and values that a group of people have to abide by. It is these attitudes that shape the behavior modes of the people in the different culture creating rules and ways of conduct in sexual relationships and sexual behavior. There is huge interplay between the sexuality and the cultural believes that hold a set of people together. It is not possible to separate these two variables based on the fact that the cultural norms have bred a new behavior in the group of people. The nature of the cultures also affects the sexual contacts that are established in the cultures. It is imperative to note that collectivist cultures are bond to have more strict rules on sexual relations in contrast to the individualist society (Agner, 1999).\nDifferences of the Sexual Attitudes and Behavior of Two Cultures:\nThe selected cultures in this case scenario are the; American and African cultures. There are diverse characteristics that mark the two cultures. The American culture which is an individualist culture does not embrace the value of close social relations. This is what makes the culture not to hold strong stringent measures on sexual behavior.

All of us are subject to cognitive errors, biases, and distortions throughout our daily lives.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Making up our minds: attitudes towards sex are changing\") Population-wide studies about attitudes towards sex can give us an insight into how our changing attitudes as a society may support efforts for social change. For example, increasing support for gay marriage reflects the way that attitudes towards same-sex sexual activity are changing over time.\nAn article published last month in the Archives of Sexual Behavior looked at changes in sexual attitudes between 1972 and 2012 using data from the nationally representative General Social Survey of US adults. By separating out the effects of time period, age and generation they were able to show how attitudes have changed - and that the change is mostly due to generational shifts. So - while young people’s attitudes may differ from their parents, the point is that their attitudes remain different over time, making the new generation different from the older generation even as they age. Take for example, acceptance of premarital sex. In the early 1970s premarital sex was accepted by 29% rising to 58% in the period between 2010 and 2012. Attitudes towards sexual activity among two adults of the same sex also changed: accepted by less than 20% before 1993 rising to 44% in 2012 (35% for men; 51% for women) and 56% for the generation born after 1982.\nHowever, while attitudes towards premarital sex and same-sex activity are becoming more accepting, attitudes towards extramarital sex and early teen sex are not becoming more permissive in the same way.\nWe cannot simply say that “attitudes are becoming more permissive”. Rather, it seems we are becoming more sophisticated in our collective attitude to sex. We seem to be less worried about the behaviour of consenting adults, but continue to be concerned about situations that may involve deception (as in the case of extramarital sex) or where the participants are under the age of consent (as in the case of early teen sex).\nThese patterns of changing attitudes are not confined to the US. Similar patterns of changes over time in sexual attitudes are evident in both Australia and Britain.\nThe Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships surveyed over 20,000 Australians aged 16-69 about their sexual attitudes and behaviour. Most (87%) agreed that premarital sex was acceptable and that an affair while in a committed relationship was unacceptable (83%). A comparison of these findings with the first Australian Study of Health and Relationships conducted 10 years earlier shows that we now have more permissive attitudes towards premarital and same-sex activity, and less tolerance of sex outside a committed relationship.\nSimilarly in Britain, the three National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles which have taken place since 1990 have shown that attitudes have changed in the same way, with acceptance of same-sex partnerships and intolerance towards those who have extra-marital affairs increasing over time.\nThese studies across the populations of the US, UK and Australia give us a broad snapshot of how attitudes towards sex are changing over time. As individuals we will always have diverse opinions based on myriad factors including our beliefs, our experiences and aspirations. As a collective group of individuals making up society (and making up our minds) our attitudes are changing and will drive social change accordingly.\nDoc 4(Title: \"Changes in Americans' attitudes about sex: Reviewing 40 ...\") n the 2010s (55% of men, 31% of women).”\n- African-Americans as a group, however, were a notable exception to these trends, and “shifts in sexual attitudes and behaviors were nearly absent” among this group.\n- The researchers note other important contextual data for these figures: The “median age at first marriage has risen markedly; it was 21 for women and 23 for men in 1970, and by 2010 was 27 for women and 29 for men. The marriage rate in the U.S. reached a 93-year low in 2014…. Marriage is also increasingly disconnected from parenting: More than 40% of babies were born to unmarried mothers in 2012, up from 5% in 1960.”\n“Overall, the results suggest that rising cultural individualism has produced an increasing rejection of traditional social rules, including those against non-marital sex,” the researchers conclude. These realities, they note, have public policy implications: “Generational changes in non-marital sexual attitudes and behaviors are particularly relevant as they influence policy decisions regarding sexual health and sexual education policies, such as decisions about emergency contraception and abortion availability and the debates around abstinence-only versus comprehensive sexual education.” Further, “these findings indicate that variability in sexual attitudes and norms according to generation, age, gender, and race/ethnicity should be considered in the development and implementation of sexual education and sexual health intervention programs.”\nKeywords: parenting, sexuality, marriage\nDoc 5(Title: \"1 Introduction - Attitudes to Mental Health in Scotland ...\") be interested in stigmatising attitudes as well as in discriminatory behaviours. First and foremost, attitudes often underpin behaviours. If the public believe that people with mental health problems should not be entitled to share the same rights and resources as others, then they are more likely to express this view through action that excludes individuals from that group. Second, even where people's attitudes do not translate into specific discriminatory behaviour, it might be argued that reducing the prevalence of stigmatising attitudes is an important part of building good relations between all sections of society. The importance of challenging stigmatising attitudes more generally (and not just in relation to those people with mental health problems) has been increasingly recognised, for example, in the 'One Scotland, many cultures' campaign[15].\n1.19 Note that it is perfectly possible for discriminatory actions to occur in the absence of such attitudes - for example as a result of bias in institutional procedures or practice. As such, where the report states that stigmatising attitudes appear to be uncommon, this does not imply that discrimination itself is uncommon or that people with mental health problems are not likely to experience this.\nPrevious research\n1.20 The first National Scottish Survey of Public Attitudes to Mental Health, Mental Wellbeing and Mental Health Problems (the Well? What do you think? survey) was commissioned in 2002 to provide baseline data in relation to the National Programme. Further rounds of the Well? What do you think? survey series (referred to in what follows as the Well? survey(s)) were commissioned in 2004, 2006, and 2008, and these were used to track progress and help influence the work of the National Programme in relation to specific outcomes and objectives[16]. The objectives of the research were to:\n- Investigate people's perceptions of their own general health and lifestyle\n- Explore people's understanding of mental wellbeing and mental health problems, and their understanding of the factors affecting these\n- Investigate people's direct experience of mental health problems and recovery from mental health problems\n- Explore people's attitudes to mental health problems, including stereotypes and myths\n- Explore people's attitudes to those who experience specific symptoms of mental health problems.\n1.21 In relation to 2013, it was agreed to repeat a reduced set of questions which would focus mainly on attitudes, and which would not cover people's knowledge and personal wellbeing in great detail. It was also agreed that rather than conducting a separate survey focusing on mental health alone, the questions should be administered as a module on SSA. Questions about people's perceptions of their own health and lifestyle, their understanding of factors affecting mental health, and their sources of information on mental health problems were therefore omitted. The remaining questions concentrated on attitudes towards mental health problems, including stereotypes and myths; attitudes to those who experience specific mental health conditions; and people's direct experience of mental health problems and recovery.\n1.22 Given that many of the questions included in SSA 2013 were also asked in the four Well? surveys, it is possible in principle to examine change over time. However, we comment below (see Para 1.25) on methodological issues which might impact on the comparisons.\nReport structure\n1.23 The remainder of the report is structured as follows:\n- Chapter two discusses people's own personal experience of mental health problems and indirect experience through knowing family or friends who have had a mental health problem; whether or not people tell others about their mental health problems; and the social impact of having a mental health problem\n- Chapter three looks at attitudes to recovery and the nature of the messages people with mental health problems receive about recovery from profe\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the provided information, here's a summary of why attitudes about sexual aggression have varied widely by culture and by era:\n\n1. **Cultural Norms**: Different cultures have varying norms and values regarding sexuality, which influence how sexual aggression is perceived and addressed.

But such services are not a guaranteed preventive measure. By treating suicide as a public health issue, we can increase mental health services, as well as other preventive measures that address the population as a whole.\nWho Is At Risk?\nMany factors contribute to suicide among people with and without known mental health conditions. Generally speaking, the more risk factors an individual has, the higher their risk.\nApproximately 1 in 5 adults experiences mental illness in a given year. (5) Though not all people who die by suicide were previously diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, there is a link between suicide and mental illness. (5)\nDepression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and substance abuse disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior.\nWhen someone is experiencing a depressive episode, a combination of biological and psychological factors may cause feelings of helplessness that make it difficult to envision a more positive past or future.\nResearch shows that alcohol use disorder is one of the strongest predictors of suicide. People with substance use disorders are about 6 times more likely to attempt suicide than the general population. (6) Older individuals with an addiction, individuals with both an addiction and a history of previous suicide attempts, heroin users, and those who abuse sedatives are at higher risk within the addiction population. (6)\nA family history of suicide increases one’s odds of dying by suicide. (7)\nChildhood trauma and abuse can be a predictor of suicidal thoughts. A 2017 study, for example, found a significant link between childhood sexual abuse and suicidal ideation in adults. (8)\nOther factors associated with suicide include: (7)\n- Relationship problems\n- Problematic substance use\n- Physical health issues or serious illnesses\n- Job and financial problems\n- Difficulty accessing healthcare\n- Criminal or legal problems\n- Unsafe media depictions of suicide\nYoung people are especially at risk for suicidal thoughts and behavior. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 14 and 25 and 34, and it’s the third-leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. (1)\nIf a child or adolescent has a number of risk factors, it’s imperative to get treatment early. Suicide can often be prevented if proper supports are quickly put in place. Among the risk factors that can affect young people: (9)\n- A recent or serious loss, such as the death of a family member, friend, or pet\n- A relationship breakup, the separation or divorce of parents, loss of a home, or financial problems affecting a family\n- A psychiatric disorder, particularly depression or a traumatic-stress related disorder\n- Previous suicide attempts\n- Alcohol and other substance abuse disorders and other high-risk behaviors\n- Family history of suicide\n- Access to lethal means such as a firearm\n- History of trauma such as physical or sexual abuse\n- Social isolation or a lack of social support\nStruggling with sexual orientation in an environment that isn’t supportive is an additional risk factor for suicide among youth. LGBTQ+ youth are more than 4 times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers. Additionally, 36 percent of LGBTQ+ youth reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed, and those who reported this attempted suicide at nearly triple the rate of those who did not in the past year. (10)\nBetween 2007 and 2017, the rate of suicide among Black youth increased faster than that of any other racial or ethnic group. (11) A report from the Congressional Black Caucus Emergency Task Force on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health states that Black youth under age 13 are 2 times as likely to die by suicide as their white peers. (11) Along with traditional risk factors, Black youth face additional risk factors, such as strain associated with racism and dis\nDoc 2(Title: \"Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors Prevention and How to Get Help\") Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors, Prevention, and How to Get Help\nSuicide is among the top nine leading causes of death in the United States for people ages 10 to 64. (1) It’s a complex problem with significant economic and human costs to individuals, families, and communities, and it’s a public health crisis.\nSuicide rates rose by nearly 33 percent between 1999 and 2019, with small decreases observed in 2019 and 2020. (1)\nWhile certain mental health conditions raise the risk of suicide, the desire to end one’s life is rarely caused by any one thing. And while there are risk factors that can help identify people in need of extra support, and sometimes there are warning signs, all too often suicide seems to come out of nowhere. One reason is that diagnosing suicide risk isn’t as simple as performing a wellness check. And the red flags, if there are any at all, can be very subtle.\nRELATED: Download the ‘Surviving the Suicide of a Loved One’ Companion PDF\nDefining the Problem\nWhile most people understand the term “suicide” to mean voluntarily taking one’s own life, the decision to stop living is one that people arrive at in many different ways. To increase understanding of what counts as suicidal behavior and to avoid confusion when discussing an individual’s self-harming behaviors, the following terminology is recommended: (2)\n- Self-Directed Violence Behavior directed at oneself that deliberately results in injury, or potential injury, to oneself.\n- Nonsuicidal Self-Directed Violence This includes behavior that is self-directed and intended to cause injury, or has the potential to cause injury but for which there is no evidence, implicit or explicit, of suicidal intent.\n- Suicidal Self-Directed Violence This includes behavior that is self-directed and intended to cause injury, or has the potential to cause injury with evidence, implicit or explicit, of suicidal intent.\n- Undetermined Self-Directed Violence Behavior that is self-directed and intended to cause injury to oneself, but evidence of suicidal intent is unclear.\n- Suicide Attempt This is a nonfatal self-directed injurious behavior with an attempt to die. A suicide attempt does not always lead to death.\n- Interrupted Self-Directed Violence A person takes steps to injure themself, but stops or is stopped by another person.\nSome people may not have attempted self-directed violence but think about doing so. This is called suicidal thought or ideation. Suicidal thoughts can be: (3)\n- Passive A person has thoughts of death but no desire or plan to harm themselves. This often looks like thoughts about one’s own death, thoughts that one would be better off dead, indifference about life, or a passive wish to die, like wanting to sleep forever or wishing for a disease or accident. Although passive suicidal ideation may not be imminently dangerous, it can still be harmful over time, as it could lead to reckless behavior or progress to more active thoughts of suicide.\n- Active A person has suicidal thoughts and at least some kind of plan to act on them. Active suicidal thoughts exist on a spectrum, and can range from wanting to end one’s own life to coming up with ideas about how to do this and forming an actual plan.\nSuicide Discussion\nPrevalence in the U.S.\nMore than 45,979 Americans died by suicide in 2020 — the most recent year for which data is available. (1) In the same year, men died by suicide 3.88 times as often as women, and white men accounted for more than 69 percent of suicide deaths. (4)\nDespite increased awareness and prevention efforts, suicide rates remain high. It’s recommended that high-risk people who verbalize suicidal thinking, make attempts, or are in a crisis that may lead to suicidal behavior receive mental health services. But such services are not a guaranteed preventive measure. By treating suicide as a public health issue, we can increase mental health services, as well as other preventive measures that address the population as a whole.\nWho Is At Ri\nDoc 3(Title: \"Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors Prevention and How to Get Help\") n shows that a person is struggling and needs to get help quickly.\nPrevention and Intervention\nFrom a public health perspective, comprehensive programs in the community, in school systems, and in the workplace play an important role in educating people about suicide and preventing suicide.\nAccessible and affordable treatment for all age groups improves the likelihood that people will seek help when they need it.\nWhen people have a better understanding of the risk factors and warning signs and they have access to services, they are more likely to reach out for help for themselves or others.\nOn an individual level, open communication about suicide and mental health, as well as unconditional support, are essential steps to keeping a friend or loved one safe. If you sense that someone is at risk, follow these steps.\nAsk Specific Questions\nAsking if someone is thinking of ending their own life does not increase the likelihood that they will attempt suicide. In fact, direct communication relieves the burden of hiding complex emotions out of fear of judgment or stigma. It can provide a feeling of relief from isolation.\nBe direct and listen carefully to the answers. Your friend or loved one needs to feel heard and understood. Try starting the conversation with questions like these:\n- “Are you having thoughts of suicide?”\n- “Have you had thoughts of suicide in the past?”\n- “When did you begin feeling this way?”\n- “How can I help you through this difficult time?”\n- “Have you considered getting help? What steps have you taken to get help?”\nProvide Support\nIt’s important to listen without judgment and convey empathy. You might not know exactly how your loved one is feeling, but you can understand that they need a listening ear, emotional support, and warmth during a difficult time.\nAvoid statements like “You have so much to live for!” or “How can you possibly be thinking of this?” Remarks like these can trigger feelings of shame and cause further isolation.\nCreate a Help Plan\nIt can be difficult for people experiencing suicidal thoughts to connect to mental health professionals and services on their own.\nOne way you can help is to gather a list of resources for treatment, such as the names of licensed psychotherapists or psychiatrists, as well as other services that can assist with personal care needs and with getting to and from appointments.\nEnact a Safety Plan\nIf you think that your friend or loved one is showing signs of imminent danger, even if you’re not certain, take the following precautions:\n- Stay with the at-risk person until help arrives\n- Remove all lethal means\n- Take the person to the nearest hospital or call 911\nWhere Can You Get Help?\nThere are a number of resources to help people who are suicidal or show risk factors for suicide. The starting point depends on the risk level.\n- Help and chat lines: The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call 988) and the Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741) provide free and confidential support and assist individuals in crisis with local resources.\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy are both recommended treatments for people experiencing suicidal ideation.\n- Some people experiencing suicidal ideation need medication. A licensed psychiatrist (a child or adolescent psychiatrist for young people) can complete a full workup and prescribe medications.\n- Call 911 in the event of imminent risk.\n- To learn more about preventing suicide, visit the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website BeThe1To.com, which was created by the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\nSuicide is complex, but it is often preventable. If individuals and communities work together to increase awareness, educate one another, and mobilize local resources, they can help people who are experiencing suicidal thoughts get the help they need.\nResources We Love\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Frequently Asked Questions About Suicide\nThis resource discusses risk factors and warning signs for suicide, as\nDoc 4(Title: \"Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors Prevention and How to Get Help\") ck Caucus Emergency Task Force on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health states that Black youth under age 13 are 2 times as likely to die by suicide as their white peers. (11) Along with traditional risk factors, Black youth face additional risk factors, such as strain associated with racism and discrimination. (11)\nRELATED: Black Mental Health: Elevating Voices to Fight Stigma and Build Trust\nA study published in 2017 found a link between increased social media use among young adults and increased social isolation. While causation remains unclear, the study found that participants who spent more than two hours a day on social media had twice the odds of perceived social isolation than those who spent a half hour a day or less. (12)\nSocial media can be beneficial in bringing together people who might otherwise struggle, for a variety of reasons, to make daily connections. But it may become a risk factor if it’s used as a replacement for human relationships.\nWhat Is Suicide Contagion?\nSuicide contagion is a term used when the suicide of one person or multiple people triggers an increase in suicidal behavior among others. This can affect all people, at any age, but it is particularly concerning for people who already have suicidal thoughts, have made previous suicide attempts, or have other risk factors for suicide.\nA study published in 2018 found a nearly 10 percent increase in suicides following the suicide of the actor Robin Williams in 2014. Males and people between ages 30 and 44 showed the greatest increase during this time period. (13)\nWhen a celebrity dies by suicide, the media is flooded with articles and reports about the death. This can include sensationalized information and specific details. The coverage can trigger people who are already experiencing suicidal thoughts to identify with the celebrity.\nFor that reason, media, public health, and suicide prevention organizations have developed “Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide” to address concerns about suicide contagion and establish best practices for news coverage related to suicide. (14) These include avoiding oversimplifying or speculating on the reason for the suicide and not describing or depicting the method or the location where the death took place.\nSigns of Suicidal Behavior\nPeople are often cautioned to look for the “red flags” for suicidal behavior. It’s important to understand that not all people show warning signs, and the signs can be hard to detect. For instance, someone seriously contemplating suicide won’t necessarily say something direct like, “I’m thinking about killing myself.” Instead, they may say something indirect like, “You’ll be better off when I’m gone.”\nAt the same time, some people do engage in behaviors that suggest imminent danger. Get immediate help if someone is researching ways to commit suicide or gathering the lethal means to attempt suicide, such as guns or medications that can cause death at high doses. Putting one’s affairs in order or giving away prized possessions can also be signs of suicidal ideation.\nOther red flags to consider include: (9)\n- Communicating feelings of hopelessness\n- Talking about wanting to die\n- Talking about being a burden to others\n- Talking about feeling trapped\n- Talking about feeling unbearable pain\n- Increased substance abuse\n- Acting unusually anxious, agitated, or reckless\n- Significant mood swings\n- Increased anger or rage\n- Withdrawing or feeling isolated\n- Changes in sleep patterns (too much or too little)\nAny warning signs should be taken seriously in adults and children. Do not assume that someone who talks about feeling hopeless or wanting to die is simply seeking attention. Each warning sign shows that a person is struggling and needs to get help quickly.\nPrevention and Intervention\nFrom a public health perspective, comprehensive programs in the community, in school systems, and in the workplace play an important role in educating people about suicide and preventing suicide.\nAccessibl\nDoc 5(Title: \"Understanding Suicide: Risk Factors Prevention and How to Get Help\") ducate one another, and mobilize local resources, they can help people who are experiencing suicidal thoughts get the help they need.\nResources We Love\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Frequently Asked Questions About Suicide\nThis resource discusses risk factors and warning signs for suicide, as well as treatment options for people at risk of suicide.\nAmerican Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP)\nThis organization is dedicated to raising awareness about mental health and suicide prevention, as well as funding research related to suicide and prevention.

Need proof?\nCalculate your environmental footprint to see how much impact just one person has on the world's resources, and adjust accordingly.\nHow Can You Be Environmentally Friendly?\nThere are small changes you can make to become more environmentally friendly, even as a student. Taking these steps will enable you to build a better future for yourself -- and the next generations. Follow these steps to start becoming more environmentally friendly right away.\nUse Reusable Bags\nPlastic grocery bags that get thrown out end up in landfills or in other parts of the environment. These can suffocate animals who get stuck in them or may mistake them for food. Also, it takes a while for the bags to decompose.\nWhether you are shopping for food, clothes, or books, use a reusable bag. This cuts down on litter and prevents animals from getting a hold of them. There are even some stores (such as Target) that offer discounts for using reusable bags!\nThese bags are useful for things other than shopping as well. I have heard of people using reusable bags when they move!\nIf you forget your bags at home, buy a new one. Better yet, keep a couple of bags in your car so you never leave home without them (just make sure you remember you put them there)!\nIf you are in a position where you need to use plastic bags, reuse them the next time you go shopping, or use them for something else. Try not to be so quick to throw them out!\nThere are some states that are outlawing or charging extra for using plastic bags. Using reusable bags helps the environment AND your budget!\nPrint as Little as Necessary\nWe have all had that teacher that wanted us to have a copy of every single reading when we come to class, or that professor who wanted a hard copy of the ten-page paper that is due next week. These are fine but it seems as if they do not understand that using so much paper is detrimental to the environment.\nWhat can you do? Ask your teacher if you can bring a laptop or an e-reader to class so that you can download the reading onto that and read it from there. If not, print on both sides of the page to reduce the amount of paper used.\nIf you need to turn in a long paper, ask the professor if it is okay to print on both sides of the page and explain why you're asking. Most teachers care about the environment as well and would be willing to allow you to do so.\nRecycle\nRecycling is such a simple thing to do, but so many people don't do it. Many garbage disposal companies offer recycling services, so check with the company you use to see if they can help you get started! It's as simple as getting a bin and putting it out with your trash cans for free!\nAlso, check with your RA to see if recycling options are offered in your dorm.\nAnother way to recycle is to look for recycling cans near trashcans. Instead of throwing recyclables in the trash with your non-recyclables, make a point to take an extra step to locate recycling cans around your campus.\nUse a Reusable Beverage Containers\nInstead of buying individually-packaged drinks, consider buying a bulk container of the beverage you want as well as a reusable water bottle. Not only will this help the environment, but it will also help you save money since you are buying a bulk container.\nMany campuses offer water fountains designed for drinking as well as for refilling reusable water bottles.

Luckily, there are countless quick and easy ways to help improve environment.\nSteps\nSimple Ways You Can Improve the Environment\n-\nAvoid plastic bags when possible. Reusable bags (such as cloth bags) are an alternative, and after 6-10 uses, you make up for the energy used to make it.[3] After your reusable bag is ineffectual, it can be given to the Grateful Thread.[4]Advertisement\n-\nLimit your energy use. Even when electronics are not in use, they still require energy, so shut down your computer(s) every night. It takes all of 5 seconds.[5]Jane Goodall, Conservation & Animal Welfare Advocate\nTake action in your own life to protect the environment. \"You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.\"\n-\nGrow your own food. Instead of waste ending up in landfills, they can be used to provide more food. Carrot tops (with the greens), garlic, green onions, and potatoes all work. Pineapples can be grown from tops as well, but require 2 years to produce fruit.[6]\n-\nEat locally.

Recycle paper and cardboard, plastic, metals, glass and all the rest: you will be able to create new, fantastic objects.\nPlastic waste is a potential threat for the environment, and this includes its accumulation on the Earth surface. Beside being a powerful pollutant for the environment as a whole, it can negatively affect wildlife habitat – whether in the ocean or amongst nature.\nThe Recycling rule, applies especially for the products you buy. Make sure the packaging of your purchases (as well as its content) is made from recycled materials. Look for the special logo, and carry on with your purchase only if you see it! Also, have you ever tried second-hand products? If not, you should make it up: give it a try. It could be key in slowing down animal extinction.\nThe 3-R rule also applies to a more sustainable life in general: every small energy-saving change can have a huge impact on the health of threatened animals.\nFor example, by reducing the carbon footprint you may be able to help the environment, and improve your health at the same time.\nSmall actions, big changes\nstart by reducing the quantity of energy and fossil fuel you and your family use during the day. There are several ways of doing so:\n- Replace light bulbs, switching to energy saving ones – such as fluorescent bulbs (if you can’t find them in supermarkets, which seems really odd today, online shopping can help). In fact, fluorescent lightbulbs can work by using less fossil fuel than conventional lightbulbs.\n- Use a laptop instead of using a desktop computer when possible: laptops consume up to 5 times less!\n- On your bike!? Bike to work instead of driving. And guess what, you won’t only reduce air pollution, but this will also have a positive impact on your wallet, and on your health.\n- When leaving home, or at nighttime, make sure you turn off the heat and unplug the electronic facilities you have. Switching them off is not enough: you must unplug your laptop cords, your television, your phone charger, and even the kettle and the toaster in your kitchen. Did you know that even if you are not actually using these electronic gadgets, they still sap energy, just by being plugged in?\nBy following these tips you will be able to save not only energy and money, but you will also save the life of many endangered species.\n3. Don’t Buy Souvenirs Made From Endangered Species\nIf you do so, you are not only risking a fine, you are also increasing extinction rates. Stay away from products made from endangered (but also still-not-so-endangered) species!\nI see, you would really love to buy some iconic souvenirs on holiday, maybe to remind your family and friends the gorgeous places you visited – like a tropical beach or a South African Resort. But even if it doesn’t seem so, by making that purchase, you are actually increasing extinction rates (besides supporting illegal trading in poaching of wildlife!).\nThese products are filled with cruelty and pain, for the animals who suffered in the production process.\nThe illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth billions and billions of dollars each year. And if on the one hand it is mostly controlled by criminal gangs, it is also very much supported by the hundreds of millions of people going on foreign holidays and buying this type of souvenirs.\nThese items include materials such as tortoiseshell, ivory, reptile skins, furs, coral. Also, try to step into the animals’ shoes: have you ever thought that no one else needs a fur but a tiger? And, that no one else needs a rhino horn but a rhino? Or, that no one else needs a tortoiseshell but a tortoise?\nThink this through, you know the answer.\n4. Eat Less Meat\nBe greener! We are literally “eating our way to extinction”. The meat industry is not only damaging farmed animals, but also wild ones – and especially the ones in danger of extinction. Studies warn that meat-eaters are actually speeding worldwide animals extinction.\nBy killing them, we are killing ourse\nDoc 4(Title: \"8 Simple Ways to Help the Environment | Fastweb\") offer water fountains designed for drinking as well as for refilling reusable water bottles. Make use of these fountains throughout the day when you finish off the initial beverage.\nAlong these lines, many restaurants offer reusable containers for drinks. If you go to a certain place a lot, consider buying one of these containers to help minimize waste.\nA lot of coffee shops even offer a discount to customers who use a reusable container for their drinks. Starbucks, as an example, offers a small discount for customers who do this. Saving the environment and money? Win-win.\nDon't Throw Your Notes Away\nAt the end of the semester, students are often stuck with notes they don't need anymore, especially from GenEd classes that had little, if anything, to do with their major.\nThe good news is that teachers that teach GenEd classes have to keep their material consistent with guidelines from the college/university. This means that students next semester will be learning basically the same material you learned from a class.\nIf you took great notes, ask your teacher to connect you with students in a future class so that you can give them your notes. These notes will help students by being able to read what they are learning in the words of another student. It's beneficial to read things that are worded differently than what the teacher said. You may need to find a student on your own, depending on the teacher's load for the semester.\nIt will feel great to help others taking the same class! You can list your notes on online college boards. While some may be willing to buy the notes at a price, it will feel just as good giving them away since you are helping them out.\nAlso, other student organizations may appreciate notes. At the community college I attended, the Veteran's Club had a separate building for resources. They had an area for\ntextbooks used by students, and they could check the books out for a semester, and many people would bundle notes in with the books. Ask around to see if any organization has something like this.\nIf you can't find anyone to give the notes to, at the very least, recycle the paper you used.\nSave Electricity!\nUse energy-efficient light bulbs instead of regular bulbs. They last longer, which will save you a bit of money (every little bit helps on a college budget, right?).\nMake sure you turn off lights, the TV, and other appliances when you are not using them.\nLower your air conditioning or heat when it's not necessary. This is especially true between seasons. Open your windows and layer your clothes in the early fall.\nSave Water\nWater is wasted more frequently than we can see. Turn off the faucet as you are brushing your teeth. Don't turn your shower on until you're ready to get in and wash your hair. Limit your water usage as you wash dishes. Changing old habits will be good for both the environment and your wallet!\nAvoid Taking Cars or Carpool When Possible\nCars are harmful to the environment. Taking public transportation, walking, or riding a bike to class are better options that help the environment and your budget. It's also a way to get some exercise in!\nIf you do need to use your car, compare schedules and places of residency with those in your classes. You can split the cost of gas and have alternating schedules for who drives when. This is cheaper than everyone driving separately and you'll be closer with friends!\nBONUS: Eat Vegan\nTry eliminating the amount of meat, fish or dairy you eat each day. Doing this will help to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce energy consumption. According to an\nIndependent article, you could reduce your \"carbon footprint from food by up to 73 percent\" just by incorporating a vegan diet!\nDoc 5(Title: \"3 Major Ways Data Science is Changing the World Today\") e as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart. A part where he says his mega-neutrino bomb was secretly a saving vaccine “against humanity as the planet’s worst virus’. As in we humans suck and everything we touch turns to dust. But as it turned out, in the real world we humans are actually the good guys.\nNot only we collectively treat our planet better each year, but we also use our best minds, resources and efforts to protect it. Three industry leaders – Environmental Defense Fund, California Air Resources Board and Plant Labs – are currently working on the conjoint reporting platform, that by launching two satellites into space aims to track the present situation and any occurring climate change squarely.\nLikewise, governments and city officials are using data patterns to allocate resources more wisely in regards to traffic routes, street lights, water supply and other utilities. The ubiquitous rise of smart homes, solar power, and multilateral recycling helps developed countries to decrease energy consumption and increase their efficiency.\nThere’s even a yearly “Data Science for Social Good” event hosted by the same-name fellowship, where data scientists from all over the world get together to help mother nature and “tackle the problems that really matter”.\nConclusion\nIt turns out data matters are inextricably linked to our modern-day progress and the whole purpose of data science is to propel that progress deeper and further.

    "question": "how have zoning ordinances contributed to racial segregation in neighborhoods?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it is evident that zoning ordinances have contributed to racial segregation in several ways:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Zoning ordinances have a long history of being used to enforce racial segregation. In the early 20th century, cities often used zoning laws to create \"white-only\" neighborhoods, restricting non-white residents from moving into certain areas. This practice was part of a broader strategy to maintain racial purity and prevent integration.\n\n2. **Exclusionary Zoning**: Zoning laws have been used to create barriers to integration by segregating neighborhoods based on race. For example, exclusionary zoning practices have been employed to make it difficult for lower-income residents, often of color, to move into affluent neighborhoods. This is achieved through measures like minimum lot size requirements, strict height limits, and other regulations that disproportionately affect low-income families.\n\n3. **Housing Discrimination**: Zoning ordinances can contribute to housing discrimination by limiting the types of housing developments that can be built in certain areas. This can lead to a concentration of low-income housing in certain neighborhoods, which may be predominantly occupied by people of color. Additionally, zoning laws can restrict the development of affordable housing, making it harder for lower-income families to find homes in desirable areas.\n\n4. **Impact on Mobility and Wealth Accumulation**: By maintaining segregated neighborhoods, zoning ordinances can limit the opportunities for residents to access better schools, jobs, and services. This can have long-term impacts on economic mobility and wealth accumulation, as people of color are often confined to areas with fewer resources and higher crime rates.\n\n5. **Current Practices**: Although explicit racial restrictions are now illegal, zoning practices continue to play a role in maintaining segregation. For instance, some communities use zoning laws to preserve their \"character,\" which can effectively exclude non-white residents. This is often justified under the guise of preserving historic neighborhoods, but can have the unintended consequence of maintaining racial segregation.\n\nIn conclusion, zoning ordinances have historically and continue to contribute to racial segregation by creating barriers to integration, limiting housing options, and impacting economic mobility and wealth accumulation.\n</think>\n<answer> Zoning ordinances have contributed to racial segregation by historically enforcing racial restrictions, creating barriers to integration, limiting housing options, and impacting economic mobility and wealth accumulation. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo understand how zoning ordinances have contributed to racial segregation in neighborhoods, I need to consider the historical context and legal actions that led to these practices. Zoning ordinances are regulations that govern land use within a community, often dividing areas into residential, commercial, and industrial zones. Historically, these ordinances have been used to enforce segregation.\n\nRacially restrictive covenants were once legally binding agreements that prohibited homeowners from selling their property to people of certain races. While these were not zoning laws per se, they were often enforced through zoning practices. Zoning ordinances could be used to create barriers to integration by segregating neighborhoods based on race.\n\nThe Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer (1948) declared racially restrictive covenants unenforceable, but zoning practices continued to play a role in maintaining segregation. For instance, exclusionary zoning, which involves creating zoning laws that make it difficult for lower-income residents to move into affluent neighborhoods, has been a common practice.\n\nTo get more specific examples and details, I should search for how zoning ordinances have been historically used to maintain segregation.\n</think>\n<search>how zoning ordinances have contributed to racial segregation in neighborhoods</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Why is there racial inequality in the US? – The Science of ...\") d to discrimination in the past and in the present. Furthermore, by understanding the origins of racial differences in behavior we can more effectively develop interventions that mitigate these differences. But it’s important to note that interventions like the belonging intervention are attempts to address the symptoms of racial inequality; they do not deal with inequality at its source by ameliorating historical injustice or correcting current discrimination (as found in the hiring and housing studies discussed above).\nIn summary\nTaking in all of the research discussed above, the role of discrimination in racial inequality has such a strong foundation in historical and empirical facts that denying the role of discrimination is to depart from a scientifically informed view. On the other hand, the notion that racial inequality is at least in part due to values, behavior, and choices is true to some extent as well. Indeed, this is at the heart of much of the research about how to close achievement gaps between Black and white students. However, the perspective found in academic journals is communicated in quite different terms compared to some conservative arguments. Scientists and historians know that racial disparities in values, behaviors, choices, and even culture have emerged in a continually discriminatory environment with intergenerational disadvantages that maintained racial inequality (the subject of another article of mine). My investigation suggests that a science-based model of the causes of inequality accepts both narratives as partly true and not mutually exclusive.\nIf someone uses the argument that individual differences in values, culture, or behavior accounts for racial disparities as a way to deny discrimination as a cause, they are no longer aligned with the scientific evidence; we know discrimination is real, is currently happening, and is part of the story of inequality. If they cite individual differences as a way of blaming disadvantaged groups for their own disadvantage, they are also not aligned with the scientific evidence; we know that many of these individual differences emerge from a historical and current context of inequality that Black communities have had minimal control over. On the other hand, if someone is denying any role for individual differences, they have also departed from the relevant science.\nIn this era of extreme partisanship and misinformation, it is more important than ever to ensure that our ideological perspectives are tempered and informed by the scientific evidence. The causal story behind racial inequality is extremely complex; I have barely scratched the surface in this article. We should leave no tool out of our tool box in order to solve the problem of racial inequality. We need people to investigate and study discrimination, the individual differences that account for inequality, the contexts that give rise to the individual differences, and the systematic forces at work. We also need science-based interventions and advocacy to address both the causes and symptoms of racial inequality. The resulting research should guide our thinking about these topics and help us find solutions. That means admitting the interplay between contexts and choices, between decisions and discrimination, and between history and the here-and-now.\n*Update 1/5/2021: For the sake of time, I left off the interesting academic debate about audit studies.

Savings incentives structured as refundable tax credits, which treat every dollar saved equally, can provide equal benefits for lower-income families.\n6. End residential segregation.\nHigher levels of racial residential segregation within a metropolitan region are strongly correlated with significantly reduced levels of intergenerational upward mobility for all residents of that area. Segregation by income, particularly the isolation of low-income households, also correlates with significantly reduced levels of upward mobility. Eliminating residential segregation by income and race can boost economic mobility for all.\nBut getting policymakers to prioritize these policies will depend on the actions of advocates, voters and other supporters with a vision for a fair and inclusive society so strong that they overwhelm powerful forces that seek to maintain the status quo.\nEach of these policies, if carefully implemented, has the potential to lift working families out of poverty, support greater economic mobility and/or reduce the growth of inequality. All of these policies could be enacted at the local, state and federal levels if there is political will. While there is still some disagreements of the best way to reduce inequality, there is a growing consensus that inequality should be reduce.\nRecently the IMF joined this consensus in finding that inequality reduces overall economy growth as well as challenges basic democratic principle and fairness. But getting policymakers to prioritize these policies will depend on the actions of advocates, voters and other supporters with a vision for a fair and inclusive society so strong that they overwhelm powerful forces that seek to maintain the status quo.\nThis article originally appeared on the Huffington Post.\nThe ideas expressed on the Haas Institute blog are not necessarily those of UC Berkeley or the Division of Equity & Inclusion, where the Haas Institute website is hosted.

In these studies, there are white and Black auditors who submit housing applications with identical information, except the person submitting the application is either Black or white. Often, the auditors are even trained to give the same responses during interactions with realtors. Again, scientists here try to control for every other conceivable factor besides race. In a meta-analysis representing 72 housing audit studies in the US, Canada, and Europe, researchers evaluated the level of housing discrimination since the 70s. During the 70s through the 90s, Black people were about 50% less likely to receive a positive response from a housing application compared to whites. Other studies showed that discrimination decreased after the 90s so that Blacks are only 25% less likely to receive a positive response on a housing application. The most recent estimate shows that Black people today are still about 15% less likely to get those positive responses compared to whites. While it has decreased, this current level of discrimination still represents a significant difference in how equally qualified Black people and white people are treated. Worse still, this decrease has coincided with other forms of housing discrimination such as on Airbnb where applications from accounts with Black names are 16% less likely to be accepted relative to identical white accounts. Homeownership is an effective way of building wealth, particularly for low-income and minority households, so housing discrimination has likely had important downstream effects that have contributed to economic inequality across the generations.\nEconomic discrimination between equally qualified Black and white people is found in a variety of domains, such as car purchasing, getting home insurance, getting a mortgage, and even hailing a taxi! The discrimination Black Americans face is sickening–literally. A 2015 meta-analysis documented that experiences with discrimination and racism in day-to-day life predicts poorer health for Black people. Data taken from 293 studies showed that reported racism predicted both poorer mental and physical health. Even within the doctor’s office, patients cannot escape the effects of racial discrimination. An audit-style study was done with physicians making recommendations about Black and white patients portrayed by actors with identical histories. Black patients were less likely to be referred for potentially life-saving treatment compared to whites with the same clinical presentation. Similar audit work has found racial discrimination towards middle class Black patients in the mental health context. Doctors have been found to harbor a racial bias that Black people are less sensitive to pain (which is likely the opposite of what is true) and thus under-prescribe pain medication to Black patients. But the effects of bias extend beyond just pain treatment. A 2015 systematic review found that racial bias of medical professionals predicts racial disparities in treatment decisions, treatment adherence, patient-provider interactions, and ultimately patient health.\nThe evidence is clear*: discrimination does indeed cause racial disparities. It’s important to recognize that these studies demonstrate discrimination between otherwise identical people. In the audit studies I reviewed above Black people weren’t discriminated against for being poor, or uneducated, or having a criminal background. All of that is controlled for in these studies. These studies demonstrate in no uncertain terms that Black Americans in the modern era are being discriminated against simply because of their race. As discussed above, racial discrimination accounts for some significant portion of disparities in employment, income, wealth, housing, transportation, and medical treatment. Black people are even discriminated against in the primary domain they have to meaningfully influence the polici\nDoc 4(Title: \"Why is Racism a Problem? - Free Essay Example | PapersOwl.com\") How To Write An Essay On Racism\nIntroduction to the Complexities of Racism\nWriting an essay on racism involves delving into a complex and sensitive subject that has deep historical roots and contemporary implications. Begin your essay by defining racism as a system of discrimination based on race, affecting individuals and groups socially, economically, and politically. Highlight the importance of understanding racism not only as overt acts of discrimination but also as institutional and systemic practices. This introduction should lay the groundwork for your exploration, whether it’s focused on historical aspects of racism, its manifestations in modern society, or strategies for combating racial prejudice and inequality.\nHistorical Context and Evolution of Racism\nThe body of your essay should include a detailed examination of the historical context and evolution of racism. Discuss how racism has been perpetuated and institutionalized over time, highlighting key historical events and policies that have contributed to racial discrimination and segregation. Depending on your essay’s focus, you might explore the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, Jim Crow laws, or apartheid, among other topics. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding how past injustices continue to shape present racial dynamics and attitudes.\nAnalyzing Modern Manifestations of Racism\nTransition to discussing the modern manifestations of racism. Examine how racism operates in current societal structures, such as in the criminal justice system, education, employment, and healthcare. Discuss the concept of systemic racism and how it perpetuates inequality, as well as the impact of racial bias and stereotypes in media representation and everyday interactions. This section should also address the intersectionality of racism, acknowledging how race intersects with other identities like gender, class, and sexuality, contributing to unique experiences of discrimination.\nStrategies for Addressing and Combating Racism\nConclude your essay by exploring strategies for addressing and combating racism. Discuss the importance of education, awareness-raising, and open dialogue in challenging racist beliefs and stereotypes. Reflect on the role of policy changes, affirmative action, and reparations in addressing systemic racism. Emphasize the importance of individual and collective action in fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. Your conclusion should not only summarize the key points of your essay but also inspire a sense of hope and commitment to anti-racist efforts, underscoring the ongoing work needed to dismantle racism in all its forms.\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Problem of Racial Discrimination - 1578 Words | Bartleby\") Assignment 2 Introduction Throughout the course of time, racial discrimination has been a part of the challenges facing all societies. This is because various groups in society began to spend increasing amounts of time working with individuals that shared similar ideas and characteristics as themselves. Over the course of time, this created various feelings about one group over that of the other. At the same time, feelings of jealousy and resentment fueled animosity between racial groups. Evidence of these kinds of distinctions is going back to some of the earliest accounts in the Bible with the Jews enslaved and escaping from slavery in Egypt. The reason why they were slaves is because the Jews were seen as inferior to the ancients Egyptians. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, many of the biologically based racial issues were brought to the forefront with the elimination of regimes that supported these kinds of practices (such as: Apartheid in South Africa). (Fredrickson, 2003, pp. 49 105) This is significant, in showing how a transformation is taking place in how society is looking at racism and the ideas of personal responsibility. To fully understand what is happening requires: examining the historical foundations of racism, how it is defined by society, the different social categories, how society has changed, recommending two ideas for improving an individual's social situation and the methods of sociological research that can be applied to these recommendations.\nImmigrants came over searching for the opportunity to have social, political, and religious freedom in America. America was a blissful place of freedom where people of all races could live harmoniously, have an abundance of opportunities while working to build the framework for this country.

The term was first established by James Adams in a book titled ‘Epic of America’, where he defines the american dream as, \"that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.

This practice was part of a broader strategy to maintain racial purity and prevent integration.\n\n2. **Exclusionary Zoning**: Zoning laws have been used to create barriers to integration by segregating neighborhoods based on race. For example, exclusionary zoning practices have been employed to make it difficult for lower-income residents, often of color, to move into affluent neighborhoods. This is achieved through measures like minimum lot size requirements, strict height limits, and other regulations that disproportionately affect low-income families.\n\n3. **Housing Discrimination**: Zoning ordinances can contribute to housing discrimination by limiting the types of housing developments that can be built in certain areas. This can lead to a concentration of low-income housing in certain neighborhoods, which may be predominantly occupied by people of color. Additionally, zoning laws can restrict the development of affordable housing, making it harder for lower-income families to find homes in desirable areas.\n\n4. **Impact on Mobility and Wealth Accumulation**: By maintaining segregated neighborhoods, zoning ordinances can limit the opportunities for residents to access better schools, jobs, and services. This can have long-term impacts on economic mobility and wealth accumulation, as people of color are often confined to areas with fewer resources and higher crime rates.\n\n5. **Current Practices**: Although explicit racial restrictions are now illegal, zoning practices continue to play a role in maintaining segregation. For instance, some communities use zoning laws to preserve their \"character,\" which can effectively exclude non-white residents. This is often justified under the guise of preserving historic neighborhoods, but can have the unintended consequence of maintaining racial segregation.\n\nIn conclusion, zoning ordinances have historically and continue to contribute to racial segregation by creating barriers to integration, limiting housing options, and impacting economic mobility and wealth accumulation.\n</think>\n<answer> Zoning ordinances have contributed to racial segregation by historically enforcing racial restrictions, creating barriers to integration, limiting housing options, and impacting economic mobility and wealth accumulation. </answer>",

These new insights and skills will likely impact future social work practice by encouraging a more proactive and foresighted approach to addressing societal issues. Social workers will be better equipped to engage with and contribute to these evolving areas, potentially leading to more innovative and effective solutions. They will also need to continuously update their knowledge and skills to stay relevant and effective in a rapidly changing world.",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nLast week's learning likely refers to recent training or experiences in social work that could influence future practices. These could include new theories, techniques, case studies, or ethical considerations. To provide a specific answer, I need to know more about what was learned specifically.\n</think>\n\n<search> impact of recent social work training on future practice </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Why social work belongs in the future – and some ideas about how to get ...\") the “foresight practitioner” training offered through the Institute for the Future where I’ve just become a research fellow. (There are other organizations offering similar training – but I’m most familiar with and respectful of this one…!)\n- AND THIS IS JUST A STARTING POINT!!!\n*These topics are increasingly coalescing around a new area of practice called “public interest technology” which I’ve written about elsewhere on this blog.\nThat said, I want to give a shout out to a burgeoning group of social workers and social work educators/researchers who are active in these circles (for example I’m putting together a separate blog post about social workers who develop apps for social change/social good). The folks who are currently doing social work in these spaces are our guides – but as a whole, I believe we need to do a lot to elevate, celebrate and study their work to grow both their impact and those that will learn from and follow them. IF YOU ARE A SOCIAL WORKER OR SOCIAL WORK ACADEMIC WORKING OR DOING RESEARCH IN THIS SPACE – please get in touch. I’d love to highlight your work in what I’m gathering, add you to my growing data base and “boost your signal” to others in our field!!\nBut I also want to suggest (supportively as well as with a critique) that these topics are seldom covered in a meaningful way in our social work curricula. We need to move more quickly to meet and create the future that we want to see. Our “gaze” needs to lift up to observe, imagine, challenge and move into new spaces, new opportunities with new allies and partners if we hope to have impact in the ways we envision. The world is changing quickly – are we ready?\nDoc 2(Title: \"Why social work belongs in the future – and some ideas about how to get ...\") Over the last year, I’ve had a LOT of conversations with social workers and social work educators around the country (and beyond) about “the future,” and futures frameworks to guide/expand our thinking about what our future roles might be. In an effort to stimulate a discourse, I’ve put together a lot of posts on this web as a precursor to a book I’m writing on this topic (bounce around to follow the journey), as well as put an annotated bibliography together for social workers to learn about/consider how futures frameworks might enhance our practice. I built a game for social work educators , and have done a number of presentations to social workers nationally on features of futures thinking/practice and introduced how these models might increase our impact. On my sabbatical next year, I’m also excited about the chance to put a “social work futures” course together. I’m grateful that CSWE saw fit to explore this issue in the last few years as well with a special task force on the topic.\nAs much fun as it can be to learn about essential futures frameworks as a starting point, it is also important to focus in on WHERE social work is most urgently needed in spaces where in many respects, the future is being “decided,” “developed” and “deployed.” What does it mean that these evolutions are in play without us (and the values/skills we bring) and we are not participating nor contributing in a major way?\nHere are some starting places where the future is being developed that may/may not (sadly often do not) include social work voices/presence. These are places where SOCIAL WORKERS BELONG!! We are learning that we may not always be invited…so sometimes we just have to invite ourselves and begin contributing. Given how “interdisciplinary” these sectors are, so far, folks I know who have been engaged have found these spaces to be welcoming of our ideas, methods, values and presence. So jump in – here’s some ideas!!\n- Tech for social good hackathons\n- Social enterprise and the role of the private sector in social good\n- Algorithmic transparency, justice and bias work as the evolution of social justice/anti-racism work*\n- Universal guaranteed income and the future of the economy/alternative economic models\n- Smart cities and democracy*\n- The future of work and how to transition vulnerable workers to it\n- Technology access as a human right*\n- Use of big data for social good* (including in policy-making and/or helping communities have access to interpreting/using big data for their own purposes)\n- Development, testing and/or evaluation of apps for mental health and/or other social determinants of health, family well-being, etc.*\n- Technology and health – including access to more equitable distribution of access to health resources, tech-related supports for disabilities, state of the art treatments, etc.*\n- Immigration/relocation issues – relevant to both international immigration/relocation as well as climate change related relocation\n- Disaster/emergency preparedness work\n- Use of technology for community organizing and the future of democracy*\n- Each and every practice area we work in is also on a path to its own “future” – for example, the future of child welfare practice, the future of mental health practice, the future of addictions practice, the future of interpersonal violence, the future of aging practice, the future of homelessness, the future of anti-racism practice and on and on and on. At the VERY least, each of us has an ethical responsibility to learn to track and engage in guiding how our issues are conceptualized, reinforced with best practice, aided by tech where possible, and improved.\n- Futures/foresight learning spaces – like the “foresight practitioner” training offered through the Institute for the Future where I’ve just become a research fellow.

Reduce Extreme Economic Inequality\nExtreme economic inequality impacts the overall health and well-being of less fortunate families and individuals in need. By developing innovative ways to address tax and wage differences among the elite and the impoverished, extreme economic inequality can be reduced. This can help struggling families and individuals across the nation.\n12. Build Financial Capability for All\nA recent report from LendingClub (April 2022) revealed that 61% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. By adopting new policies that support income generation and decrease economic hardship, social workers can more effectively serve those who are struggling financially.\n13. Achieve Equal Opportunity and Justice\nPrejudice is a barrier that negatively impacts access to education and employment opportunities. By confronting racism, stereotypes and other injustices, the opportunities for everyone to advance in society increase.\nBecome an Agent of Positive Change\nAs society continues to change, so will the social work landscape. That’s why it’s critical for social work professionals to further their education. By pursuing a Master of Social Work degree at the University of Nevada, Reno, you can receive the tools to hone your skills in the ever-changing world of social work.\nWith an MSW, you can navigate social work’s grand challenges and provide effective solutions to some of the nation’s most pressing problems.

Like most of the other grand challenges of social work, the key to stopping family violence is to be proactive rather than reactive.\n4. Advance Long and Productive Lives\nAccording to the Administration for Community Living, the number of Americans aged 65 and older will grow dramatically over the next few decades, reaching 94.7 million by 2060. As the population of older Americans continues to grow, rates of health-related issues and conditions will also increase. This puts more pressure on health and social services, which makes it critical for social workers to develop interventions for helping the elderly and promoting greater overall health in aging populations.\n5. Eradicate Social Isolation\nSocial isolation is far more dangerous than many would expect. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), social isolation has been linked to increased risk of premature death, heart disease and stroke. By educating the public about strategies to promote social interaction, social workers can help isolated individuals improve their overall mental, physical and spiritual health.\n6. End Homelessness\nAccording to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, there were approximately 580,466 homeless individuals in the U.S. in 2020. Over 70,000 of them were veterans and unaccompanied youths. Homelessness can negatively impact individual health in multiple ways, and the effects are often long-lasting. By developing new service innovations and technologies and creating new policies to ensure affordable housing, social workers can help reduce the number of individuals experiencing homelessness.\n7. Create Social Responses to a Changing Environment\nClimate change and urban development have had an adverse impact on population health. According to The Nature Conservancy, the impacts of climate change strain agricultural systems and contribute to an increase in severe weather events such as storms, floods and wildfires. Helping conserve and protect the Earth is perhaps the biggest of the grand challenges of social work. However, by developing transformative social initiatives that engage communities to take charge, society as a whole can improve.\n8. Harness Technology for Social Good\nAs in many other fields, technology has the power to transform social work, allowing professionals to target their efforts for maximum efficacy. By utilizing technology in creative ways — such as applications designed for case planning, setting up treatment plans and organizing assessments — social workers can provide proper assistance to individuals and communities in need.\n9. Eliminate Racism\nAlthough America has come a long way since its founding, it has yet to fully eliminate one of its greatest historical flaws — racism. It’s no secret that the United States has a lengthy history of racism and white supremacy that still plague society. Racial inequality rears its ugly head in a myriad of ways, such as through racist policies, racial bias and discriminatory practices such as redlining. Social work has made considerable progress in the fight for equality and civil rights. To truly eliminate racism, social work must help develop a model that identifies hard evidence and employs practice-based interventions.\n10. Promote Smart Decarceration\nAccording to the Prison Policy Initiative, there were more than 1.8 million incarcerated people in 2020. The churn of jailed individuals (the number of times people are booked into a facility in a year) is skyrocketing at an alarming rate. By developing evidence-based solutions, social workers can promote smart “decarceration” — the act of removing individuals from institutions — and find effective ways to decrease the number of individuals going to prison, while offering sufficient solutions for overall public safety.\n11.

Lack of participation means services may not fully meet the needs of the populace.\n\n5. **Unemployment and Poverty**: High unemployment rates and poverty levels exacerbate the demand for better services, making it difficult for local authorities to meet these demands.\n\n6. **Service Provider Qualifications**: Deploying unqualified individuals to critical roles can lead to poor service delivery.\n\n7. **Outsourcing**: While outsourcing can sometimes improve service quality, it also poses challenges such as accountability and hidden costs.\n\n8. **Protests and Dissatisfaction**: Public protests due to poor service delivery highlight the frustration of citizens and can lead to further deterioration if not addressed.\n\nBased on these findings, poor service delivery is primarily driven by a combination of resource constraints, political and administrative issues, economic factors, and social dynamics.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Resource constraints, political and administrative issues, economic factors, and social dynamics </answer>",

It interrogated and critiqued documents on what other researchers in their different contexts had established in view of the feasibility of outsourcing as a strategy to improve service delivery. It emerged in this study that political interference, lack of citizen participation. lack of funds and corruption were the main causes of poor service delivery in local authorities. Therefore, outsourcing was seen to bring quality and affordable services for the public while costs savings and emergence of hidden costs were the financial implications unveiled for the local authorities (LAs). Social costs, accountability for public service delivery and quality shading were cited to be the outsourcing challenges. It also emerged in this study that outsourcing can increase service quality and provide affordable services for the public. Taking into account the information that was accumulated and examined, the researchers came to the conclusion that the current services being offered by local authorities are very poor and this is attributed to many causes such as political interference, lack of citizen participation, lack of funds and corruption. The study therefore, concludes that outsourcing could be a feasible option to use to improve service delivery by local authorities.\nSuggested Citation\nWadesango N & Mhaka C & Chikomo T & Wadesango V O, 2018.\n\"Causes of Poor Service Delivery and the Feasibility of Outsourcing to Improve Services in Local Authorities,\"\nJournal of Economics and Behavioral Studies, AMH International, vol. 10(2), pages 188-198.\nHandle:\nRePEc:rnd:arjebs:v:10:y:2018:i:2:p:188-198\nDOI: 10.22610/jebs.v10i2(J).2228\nDownload full text from publisher\nCorrections\nAll material on this site has been provided by the respective publishers and authors.

According to ANC spokesperson Jesse Duarte there have been protests in ‘only’ 14 of the 283 municipalities, but other sources put the figure at more than twenty. The strike this week by municipal workers raises fears that dissatisfaction with municipal service delivery may further increase and that this might see a spread in protest action. Many of these protests have also turned violent and there are indications that criminals are exploiting the situation. Incidents of apparent xenophobia were also reported. Groups of foreigners, fearing the kind of attacks that saw 60 foreigners killed in 2008, are again seeking shelter at police stations. In a number of places the police had to use force to stabilise the situation and to restore order. Police action included arrests for looting, public violence and various other crimes.\nMany reasons for these protests are offered. The primary reason, it would appear, is dissatisfaction with the delivery of basic municipal services such as running water, electricity and toilets, especially in informal settlements. Unemployment (officially at around 23%), high levels of poverty, poor infrastructure, and the lack of houses add to the growing dissatisfaction in these and other poor communities. This comes in the wake of political promises during the election period that all or most of these issues will be addressed once the new government is in place. According to some protesters this has been a recurring theme with every elections since 1994. To some extent this claim is supported in an article in 2005 by Prof Nico le Roux from the School of Public Management and Administration at the University of Pretoria, in which he reminds us that the 2004 elections were followed by similar demonstrations in 21 local communities in different parts of the country and for precisely the same reasons. In this regard it is perhaps also worth considering the fact that the South African elections normally takes place in the April/May period, immediately before winter when its harsh realities exacerbate the absence of life’s immediate necessities.\nA number of other reasons for or causes of the public protests are also provided. These include allegations of rampant corruption and nepotism within local government structures. Some protesters blame poor service delivery on the deployment of ANC ‘comrades’ to positions for which they are not qualified. The Minister for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Sicelo Shiceka, speaking to the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) in East London on Wednesday (22 April), admitted that ‘many of our municipalities are in a state of paralysis and dysfunction’. According to the Minister, local government is perceived to be incompetent, disorganised and ‘riddled with corruption and maladministration’. He indicated that, if what they found in North West Province is indicative of the state of municipalities elsewhere in the country, there might be a need to declare a ‘national state of emergency’ on local government.\nIt is necessary, at this stage, to consider the nature and implications of these service delivery protests against allegations of third force involvement and concerns over its revolutionary potential. So far, no evidence of a third force could be produced, but it may still be useful to consider the revolutionary potential of widespread public discontent and violent acts of protest.\nJames Davies, an American sociologist, in a 1962 article titled ‘Towards a Theory of Revolution’ theorised about rising expectations and the likelihood of armed conflict. His theory became known as the Davies J-curve, a model that attempts to explain the position where the pace of an individual’s reality is no\nDoc 5(Title: \"Causes of Poor Service Delivery in Africa and Their Impact ...\") Making sure you're not a bot!\nLoading...\nWhy am I seeing this?\nYou are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites.

Lack of participation means services may not fully meet the needs of the populace.\n\n5. **Unemployment and Poverty**: High unemployment rates and poverty levels exacerbate the demand for better services, making it difficult for local authorities to meet these demands.\n\n6. **Service Provider Qualifications**: Deploying unqualified individuals to critical roles can lead to poor service delivery.\n\n7. **Outsourcing**: While outsourcing can sometimes improve service quality, it also poses challenges such as accountability and hidden costs.\n\n8. **Protests and Dissatisfaction**: Public protests due to poor service delivery highlight the frustration of citizens and can lead to further deterioration if not addressed.\n\nBased on these findings, poor service delivery is primarily driven by a combination of resource constraints, political and administrative issues, economic factors, and social dynamics.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Resource constraints, political and administrative issues, economic factors, and social dynamics </answer>",

Depending on the stability and maturity of the older sibling, such a situation can have a positive or negative effect on both children 1.\nBullying\nSometimes teens and preteens who appear up for the challenge of babysitting their younger siblings do so to be able to have control over situations. In some cases, this can lead to bullying of younger children 2. Being unfairly bossed around by an older sibling causes feelings of anxiety, depression and confusion in the younger child, which usually negatively affects cognitive and social development 1. By learning the difference between bullying and harmless sibling rivalry, you will be able to prevent future abuse. If you suspect that your younger child is being bullied, you should either put him in child care or find an alternative solution.\n- Sometimes teens and preteens who appear up for the challenge of babysitting their younger siblings do so to be able to have control over situations.\nDelinquency\nThe Signs & Symptoms of Socialization Problems in Children\nLearn More\nAdolescents without proper parental supervision are more likely to engage in delinquent acts, from occasional truancy to more severe infractions, such as property or violent crimes. When an older child is given the job of taking care of his younger sibling, he can be a negative influence and involve the younger child in delinquent acts 1. This is especially the case when the younger sibling is very impressionable or idolizes her older brother or sister.\nResponsibility\nA positive outcome of older children taking care of younger children is having the opportunity to learn responsibility and time management skills. Adolescents in this type of situation are still required to study and do homework, complete any assigned chores, as well as take care of their younger siblings. While it is a lot to expect out of most adolescents, some are ready for this level of responsibility. To assure that your older child is ready for this type of challenge, ask yourself if he can follow rules, if he is mentally and physically able to care for himself and his sibling, and if he is comfortable with the situation.\n- A positive outcome of older children taking care of younger children is having the opportunity to learn responsibility and time management skills.\n- Adolescents in this type of situation are still required to study and do homework, complete any assigned chores, as well as take care of their younger siblings.\nRole Model\nLong Term Effects of Yelling at Children\nLearn More\nAn adolescent who is mature enough to take on the task of looking after a younger sibling has the chance to become a positive role model for him. An older sibling can be a helpful influence in any younger child’s life in a variety of ways, such as helping with homework, teaching right versus wrong and aiding in the development of social skills.

She joins us now from Wisconsin Public Radio.\nWelcome, Kathy.\nKATHY BORKOWSKI: Good afternoon.\nLUDDEN: Can you just take us back for some background? When your father - I guess your mother died first and then your father. How was it that you became the caregiver, and how old were your siblings then?\nBORKOWSKI: Well, my mother died in 1970, when I was 16. She died of breast cancer. And then my father never really got over that trauma. And then the years - a couple years passed, and he died when I was 19. He committed suicide.\nLUDDEN: That must have been so hard.\nBORKOWSKI: It was. And I think it was challenging - I mean, my mother's death, although that was really hard, was expected after a while. She'd been sick for about three years. But for us, my father's death was very unexpected. And my siblings at that point, when I was 19 - the next one down from me was 14, and then - my brother was 14, my sister was 13, and my youngest brother was 10.\nLUDDEN: So you were having to deal with adolescents and teens while you were a teenager. How was it that you became the caregiver? There was no one else who - what happened?\nBORKOWSKI: Well, we have relatives who are sort of spread from coast to coast, aunts and uncles. And at one point they did come together, and there was talk of, you know, each of them sort of taking one of the kids, which, you know, from a selfish standpoint, would have been awful. I would have been - really, I would have lost everything at that point.\nAnd so fortunately, we all wanted to stay together, and we had a - the attorney who had been my father's business attorney was helping with all of this and knew that I had been doing - taking care of the family since my mother had taken sick, and so was really in our corner and said, no. We can make this work. And so we kept the kids all together and stayed together as a family unit.\nLUDDEN: And by consensus, everyone - the four of you were - wanted this to happen this way.\nBORKOWSKI: Yes, absolutely.

In the real world, though, it's not quite that romantic. Understanding the basics of the marriage license and marriage certificate process is key to guaranteeing that your nuptials are properly (and legally) signed and sealed, so you can live happily ever after—officially. We talked to marriage experts about these important documents. Diane Smith-Hoban, executive director of Journeys of the Heart Mirelle Eid, owner of Honeybreak Officiants The Ultimate Wedding Day Checklist: What You'll Need for Every Part of Your Event The Marriage License vs. the Marriage Certificate There's a simple way to explain the difference between the marriage license and the marriage certificate: A marriage license lets two individuals get married; a marriage certificate proves they did it. What Is a Marriage License? Getting your marriage license is a must-do task for your pre-wedding checklist. \"A marriage license is a legal document applied for by a couple and issued by the county/state that allows them to marry,\" says Diane Smith-Hoban, executive director of Journeys of the Heart. \"This must be obtained before the wedding.\" How to Get a Marriage License Each state has its own requirements for obtaining a marriage license; expiration dates, waiting periods, and fees all vary. \"Couples will apply for a marriage license and then pick it up from the town/city clerk's office anywhere from a few days to a month before their wedding,\" says Mirelle Eid, owner of Honeybreak Officiants. Requirements for a Marriage License Most states require applicants to show up in person at the local clerk's office and have a valid photo I.D. To get a marriage license in most states, the couple must be at least 18 years old or, if younger, have consent from a parent or judge. If either of you were married before, you'll need to show proof of your divorce or annulment. Both parties must be mentally capable of understanding what getting married means, and they can't be closer than third cousins. Blood tests aren't required in any state; some states do, however, require a witness to be present when a license is issued. Research other rules pertaining to the state where you're marrying. In New Mexico, for example, an engaged couple is issued a license immediately at the county clerk's office (if they pass certain requirements); there's no waiting period, and the fee is $25. In Alaska, the waiting period is three days from the time the license is issued; the license is valid for three months and costs $60. In New York, says Eid, the marriage must take place within 60 days of getting the license but not less than 24 hours after. \"This 24-hour maturation period is stamped on the license to the minute,\" she says. So if you pick up your license at 4:32 p.m. on the day before your wedding, it can't be legally signed at your 2 p.m. ceremony the next day.

I had to take on a parent role for my younger sister. I was constantly on her back to finish her homework and clean up. Basically I was trying to help my mom with the parenting, and now as we've grown up, it turns out my sister does not look at me as a friend, but rather she always complains that she has two moms.\nLet's bring another call in, Chris(ph) in Denver, hi Chris.\nCHRIS: Hi, this is a really interesting conversation. I kind of bring together my personal experience of being the oldest of a blended sibling set, two biological brothers and a step-brother and step-sister that are 10 and 11 years younger than I am. And our parents worked out of town a couple of days a week. So there were always at least two days a week that I was in charge as a 15- and 16- and 17-year-old.\nAnd then I worked in family court and with juvenile offenders, and in that realm, I also saw a lot of instances where an older sibling ended up being the caretaker for the younger siblings because the parents were incarcerated or, you know, had drug and alcohol issues. And I like what your guest has brought up about the concept of there are gains but also a price to pay.\nOne thing that I have seen as a through-line in, again, my personal experience and also some of my professional experiences, are challenges that come with adult relationships once that older sibling who kind of inherits responsibility early enters adulthood and also the idea that it's very hard to ask for help because you've inherited independence and a tremendous amount of responsibility so early in age, you take all of this on, and once you get into adulthood, it's very hard to ask for help, and you end up taking - continuing to take on things in adulthood without knowing how to enlist the help of others.\nLUDDEN: Ha.\nCHRIS: And I think a lot of that ties back to that, you know, that early inheritance of responsibility.\nLUDDEN: That's interesting because I would have thought, on one hand, you would have been forced to ask for help to take on so much. But I guess you just felt you got - you had it. You became independent and - hmm. Vicki Panaccione?\nPANACCIONE: Well, I think that this is what happens with kids who have to raise their sibs even in homes, and I have to say I see this even in the best of homes. There's two-parent families that are both working, and they just have long hours, and the older kids have to come home and fix the dinner or get the kids to start on their homework or their bath.\nSo this situation really runs the gamut, from the hardworking best of families all the way up to the worst case scenarios. And so I see a price. And I work with families a lot like this in my office, and I do see a price because I think you're right. Chris, you don't start asking for help because the actual unspoken message really is we need you to take care of this. So you do.\nLUDDEN: Now what about - Chris mentioned it's difficult to form adult relationships.\nPANACCIONE: I think that can be, first of all, that you could miss out on having the model of a mom or a dad or both of them in the home to see what adult relationships are all about. And also, again, they've lost that opportunity to develop into a functioning adult. You're just kind of thrown into it. And so I think that they're so self-sufficient and feel like they need to be in control and can't ask for help, that it may be hard to let someone else in.\nLUDDEN: Chris, thank you so much for your call.\nCHRIS: Thank you.\nLUDDEN: And let's get another caller on the line.

Constantly increasing competition in the modern health care industry has changed the role of the governments. It rearranged health care advocacy coalitions and interests, and made existing government policy tools obsolete or less meaningful. The public remains anxious about efforts to reduce subscriber utilization of inpatient hospital care and specialist services as a means of controlling costs (Chapman 14). The growing use of restrictive managed care arrangements by insurers has generated new concerns about the quality of care provided to the elderly, the poor, and patients who require costly treatments (McDonough 180). Under these circumstances, enacting comprehensive health care reform at the government level is necessary for coping with the dramatic changes in the organization and financing of health care.\nInsurance and the Government\nWithin all societies, the governments should assume responsibility for assuring medical care for all citizens. On the one hand, some members of society may not have sufficient means to insure themselves. On the other hand, if they have sufficient resources, they may suffer a form of myopia that means they allocate not adequate resources to cover their health care needs. One solution here can be to blanket in these difficult cases by socializing insurance either through the tax system, as in Canada, or through a system of non-profit sickness funds based on compulsory membership, as in Germany (McDonough 342).\nInsurance services would be produced more efficiently if they were produced by the governments. It is indicated that the government provides some insurance benefits at a lower unit administrative cost than the private markets would be able to provide them. For example, Flood (2000, p.1154) makes that point in the consideration of the Polish social insurance system. It is true that the government can nationalize medical care, make it universal, impose the same benefit scales on every citizen and then administer the system more cheaply than the private markets would do. Government may develop sufficient range of insurance products that may appear to add value because they can be adapted to suit individual needs.\nAssurances from the government to the members of the medical profession and the leaders of the voluntary hospital sector can improve access to the health care system for two seriously disadvantaged groups, the elderly and the poor. All conditions of medical care delivery would remain under professional control and guidance.\nResponsibility for providing health care services to the uninsured and underinsured should rest evidently with state government. For example, in the case of the poor, Congress created Medicaid: the government became the principal payer. This initiative designed a system of universal coverage for their residents. Both Medicare and Medicaid have had success making easier for the states to cover incremental expenditures incurred in treating increasing numbers of the poor and the uninsured. Medicare has also made it easier for rural hospitals and physicians that are in difficulties to increase their revenues and earnings, thereby helping them continue to provide sufficient health care to the rural population.\nFunding the Government Health Care\nThe government actively promotes competition as a means of controlling costs and increasing access to health care. Medicaid managed care waivers, for instance, can be used to considerably expand access to health care for individuals without health insurance by plowing cost savings from capitation for program enrollees into state-subsidized insurance programs for the working poor (Bauman 219). Government can also impose a mandatory budget cap on health care expenditures. In both examples, government officials are not just passive observers of market competition. Instead, they are channel and direct market forces in pursuit of public goals (for example, controll\nDoc 4(Title: \"Government Healthcare Pros and Cons - ThoughtCo\") Humanities › Issues › U.S. Liberal Politics › Pros and Cons of Government Healthcare Print Buero Monaco / Getty Images Issues U.S. Liberal Politics Liberal Voices and Events The U.

Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 13, 2025 Close Key Takeaways Government healthcare can make medical services accessible to those who are uninsured or underinsured.Critics argue government healthcare reduces patients' choices and could overwhelm private insurance options.Many Americans supported having a choice between public and private healthcare options. Government healthcare refers to government funding of healthcare services via direct payments to doctors, hospitals, and other providers. In the U.S. healthcare system, medical professionals are not employed by the government. Instead, they provide medical and health services privately and are reimbursed by the government for these services, in much the same way that insurance companies reimburse them. An example of a successful U.S. government healthcare program is Medicare, established in 1965 to provide health insurance for people aged 65 and over or who meet other criteria such as disability. For many years, the U.S. was the only industrialized country in the world, democratic or non-democratic, without universal healthcare for all citizens provided by government-funded coverage. But in 2009, that changed. Here's everything that happened and why it matters still today. 50 Million Uninsured Americans in 2009 In mid-2009, Congress worked to reform U.S. healthcare insurance coverage, which at that time left more than 50 million men, women, and children uninsured and without access to adequate medical and health services. This deficit was due to the fact that healthcare coverage for all people, except for some low-income children and those covered by Medicare, was provided only by insurance companies and other private-sector corporations. This made it inaccessible for many Americans. Private company insurers proved ineffective at controlling costs and providing inclusive care, some actively working to exclude as many people from healthcare coverage as possible. Explained Ezra Klein for The Washington Post: \"The private insurance market is a mess. It's supposed to cover the sick and instead competes to insure the well. It employs platoons of adjusters whose sole job is to get out of paying for needed health care services that members thought were covered,\" (Klein 2009). In fact, multi-million bonuses were even awarded annually to top healthcare executives as an incentive to deny coverage to policyholders. As a result, in the United States pre-2009, more than eight in ten of individuals uninsured were from families living 400% below the Federal Poverty Level. Non-white populations were also disproportionately uninsured; Hispanics had an uninsured rate of 19% and Blacks had a rate of 11% though people of color only made up 43% of the population. Finally, 86% of uninsured individuals were adults not classified as elderly. In 2007, Slate reported, \"The current system is increasingly inaccessible to many poor and lower-middle-class people ... those lucky enough to have coverage are paying steadily more and/or receiving steadily fewer benefits,\" (Noah 2007). This widespread issue led to a reform campaign begun by the Democratic party and supported by the president. Reform Legislation In mid-200\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Government Should Provide Health Care | Blablawriting.com\") working poor (Bauman 219). Government can also impose a mandatory budget cap on health care expenditures. In both examples, government officials are not just passive observers of market competition. Instead, they are channel and direct market forces in pursuit of public goals (for example, controlling Medicaid costs).\nThe primary funding for the health care can be accomplished through a Government Health Care Fund. The funds for this heath care program is derived and provided to the Fund in the following manner (Bauman 251):\n- Employer contribution equal to 3 percent of the gross earnings of each wage or salaried employee.\n- Employee contribution of 7 percent of gross earnings, with no upper limit.\n- A 1 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on all consumer durables produced in the home country or imported from foreign nations.\n- For each dollar of foreign aid granted to any foreign government or nation 0.001 percent of such amounts will be provided to the Health Care Fund for national health care.\nUniversal Coverage\nIf any kind of universal coverage is adopted, the costs are large in size and require all citizens to both contribute to the government health care system and contribute to the reduction of the national debt. If health care is absolutely “de-linked” from the workplace and the government makes a social contract with individuals for their own health care, business and industry can go about doing what they should do-making a high quality product at the lowest possible price, while providing a reasonable rate of return to investors (Crichton and Robertson 142). In this case, a government health care plan will stand or fall on the willingness of individuals to pay their fair share of the costs for the received health care.\nThe Role of Government in Health Care\nThe following aspects of health care need to be put into focus:\n- Patients’ incentives should probably be reweighed by subjecting every lab test, visit to a medical office or clinic, or other item of medical service to a “deductible” (Chapman 36).\n- Governments need to bar “punitive” damage claims for malpractice. Careful estimations must be required for “substantive” damage claims (Crichton and Robertson 57).\n- Governments need to control litigiousness. For example, in the United States it is far worse than in other countries (Havighurst and Richman 10).\n- Governments urgently need legislative reform to control the authority of such interest groups as health insurers and health providers (Havighurst and Richman 10).\nConclusion\nThe unsuccessful attempts to enact national health care since early in the century were the result of constant constraints on reorganizing the financing and delivery of health care. Health care has historically been fixed in fee-for-service physician care and the prevalence of voluntary hospitals. Further, the health care system was extremely transformed in the post-war period by the rapid growth of private health insurance. However, except for tax subvention, the government played no direct role in public health care until the passage of Medicare and Medicaid.\nToday, the governments should take a lead role in the reform of the current health care system. The governments have residual responsibility for the provision of essential health care to all of their citizens. Government, not companies, should provide health care. The goal of transferring full responsibility to government might prove effective. A completely government-controlled health care system could provide basic health care services to the entire population. Government provision of adequate health care for the whole population produces commitment to social justice and a sense of solidarity and mutual dependence among the population.\nReferences\nBauman, Robert E.

The vice president is also president of the U.S. Senate, and can cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate.\nInitially, electors did not vote separately for president and vice president, but cast a single vote; the candidate who came in second became the vice president. But in 1804, after two highly contentious national elections, the 12th Amendment changed the voting process to the current system.\nDid you know?\nPresident Thomas Jefferson and Vice President George Clinton were the first executives to be voted into the White House after the passage of the 12 Amendment.\nThe federal government has 15 executive departments (including Defense, State, Justice, Labor, Education, Health and Human Services and so on). Each of these departments is led by a member of the presidential cabinet, who serve as advisors to the president.\nThe heads of numerous executive agencies (the Central Intelligence Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, etc.) are not formally members of the Cabinet, but they do fall under the president’s authority. The executive branch also includes more than 50 independent federal commissions, including the Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission and many others.\nAnother integral part of the executive branch is the Executive Office of the President (EOP), which was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Headed up by the White House chief of staff, the EOP includes the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Security Council and the White House Communications and Press Secretary.\nWho Is in Charge of the Executive Branch?\nArticle II of the Constitution specified that a president—who is in charge of the executive branch—should be elected to a term of four years. According to its terms, only natural-born citizens of the United States of at least 35 years of age, who have lived in the United States for at least 14 years, are eligible for the nation’s highest executive office.\nOnly one president in U.S. history—Franklin D. Roosevelt—has served more than two terms in office. In 1951, six years after FDR’s death during his fourth term, Congress ratified the 22nd Amendment, which limited presidents to two terms. This restriction serves as an additional check on the power of any one person over the nation’s government.\nThe vice president is also elected to a four-year term, but vice presidents can serve an unlimited number of terms, even under different presidents. The president nominates members of the Cabinet, who must then be approved by at least 51 votes in the Senate.\nDoc 2(Title: \"The Impact of Corruption on the Effectiveness of Public ...\") s ills[28].\nIn a liberal democratic setting, the Public Administration is designed as an executive tool to serve citizen’s expectations. These expectations are primarily expressed through the voting process based on Agendas. The elected representatives, now officially transformed into policy makers, are expected to demonstrate responsiveness for two major reasons; the first is, to keep their electoral promises and the second, to secure their reelection. They can do this through the executive action by vertically interacting with the Public Administration. The latter can only perform properly and reach a high level of efficiency and effectiveness if it is protected from the negative interference of political bias.\nMilton Friedman, from capitalism to freedom, University of Chicago press, 1962. “To the free man, the country is the collection of individuals who compose it, not something over and above them. He is proud of a common heritage and loyal to common traditions. But the regards government is as a mean, an instrumentality, neither a grantor of favors and gifts, nor a master or god to be blindly worshiped and served”.\nWoodrow Wilson, the shady of Administration, Political Science Quarterly, 1887. “Administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics. Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its office”.\nE. Responsiveness in Public Administration:\nResponsiveness refers to the practice of ensuring that clients are served helpfully and responsibly by government agencies and officials. Wilson argued that the most common strategy for dealing with the idea of responsiveness is to treat it as an aspect of responsibility. While Finer made responsibility a subdivision of responsiveness, rather than vice versa. Thus, the agency has to ensure that its services are accessible to clients[29]. Approaches are controversial in understanding responsiveness in public administration. Some scholars refer to responsiveness as a ‘necessary evil’ that seems to conciliate professional effectiveness and a signal to political convenience if not absolute corruption. However, other scholars suggest that democracy would appear to necessitate administrators who are responsive to the people’s will at least through politicians and legislatures if not straight to the population. Dissimilar to the private sector, the public one must take into consideration social equal opportunities, equity, welfare, and just supply of ‘public goods’ to all residents. To examine the performance of governmental activities, the acceptance of the people for the outcome of public administration activities must be tested according to some measures such as the contributiveness, fruitfulness, responsiveness to public needs and equality of the distribution of these activities[30].\nCorruption in the political system, the misappropriation of public funds, the bureaucratic rigidity, red tapism weaken the public administration and make it irresponsive to the people’s needs[31].\nF. Failure of the Democratic Process in Decision-Making:\nThe values of democracy and the rule of law are both fundamental to the modern administrative state. Democracy enhances the credibility and stability of government and also improves the quality of public policy[32]. Democracy creates the enabling environment for broad based economic growth through markets. The predictability and stability of policies are conducive to markets, and the protection of property rights and enforcement of contracts are best ensured under democratic regimes. Democracy facilitates openness in policy dialogue, free press and respect for human rights and the rule of law, which are crucial for economic growth.\nEthics is one of the vital components that allow democracy to thrive in any country. Ethics in government is critical to realizing the promises of democracy. In a democracy, a government has an obligation to treat every\nDoc 3(Title: \"History of democracy - Wikipedia\") a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy. Despite its flaws (slavery, no women's rights) it is often considered the closest to the ideal democracy and called as classical democracy. It is often compared with modern (representative) democracies.[171][172]\n- ^ The ancient Greeks did not have a word to use for \"rights\".[173]\n- ^ The United States of America was and is, a republic, not a direct democracy. A direct democracy can be defined as a form of government in which the people decide matters directly, with prime example the Athenian democracy. A democratic republic, is a form of government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law. The delegates who wrote the Constitution were fearful of direct democracy; in the words of James Madison: \"[D]emocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention: have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property: and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\"[174] Nevertheless, the framers recognized that the public is required to impose a check to the government, in Madison words: \"dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government\".[175] By popular usage, however, the word \"democracy\" came to mean a form of government in which the government derives its power from the people and is accountable to them for the use of that power. In this sense the United States can be called a democratic republic. Many states allow for policy questions to be decided directly by the people by voting on ballot initiatives or referendums. (Initiatives originate with, or are initiated by, the people while referendums originate with, or are referred to the people by a state's legislative body.)\n- ^ For more information on the history of democracy in India, see Democracy in India#History\nReferences\n[edit]Citations\n[edit]- ^ Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, p. 440.\n- ^ \"democracy, n.\" OED Online.

Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.\nDemocracy is generally associated[vague] with the efforts of the ancient Greeks, whom 18th-century intellectuals such as Montesquieu considered the founders of Western civilization. These individuals attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization.[3][page needed] The extent to which these 18th-century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be. Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of the British Empire following the end of the Second World War.\nModern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gap between Rousseau's depiction of the state of nature and Hobbes's depiction of society as inevitably authoritarian through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote.[4]\nAntiquity\n[edit]Prehistoric origins\n[edit]Anthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter-gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged[disputed – discuss] in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50–100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief.[4]\nThese types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism, or primitive democracy. In this sense, a primitive democracy usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village, council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government.[5][verification needed] This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule – including monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy – have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.[6][verification needed][disputed – discuss] David Graeber and David Wengrow, in The Dawn of Everything, argue in contrast that cities and early settlements were more varied and unpredictable in terms of how their political systems alternated and evolved from more to less democratic.[7]\nThe concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens in the sixth-century BC (circa 508 BC). In ancient Greece, where there were many city-states with different forms of government, democracy (\"rule by the demos\", i.e. citizen body) was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy, literally \"rule by the best\"), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.\nPotential proto-democratic societies\n[edit]Although fifth-century BC Athens is widely considered to have been the first state to develop a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy,[8][9][10][11][12][13] in recent decades scholars\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Impact of Corruption on the Effectiveness of Public ...\") - En\n- Fr\n- عربي\nThe Impact of Corruption on the Effectiveness of Public Administration\nIntroduction\nPublic administration represents the organizational arrangements, managerial practices, and institutionalized values which officials legislate in the chase of policy implementation and in the endorsement of the will of governments[1]. This statement echoes the one made Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his famous Social Contract: “the law is the expression of the general will”.\nWoodrow Wilson states that public administration is the most evident part of government; it is government in action; it is the executive, the operational and the most obvious side of government. In other words, public administration is concerned with politics and policy making; it inclines to be concentrated in the executive branch of the government where the means by which the purposes and goals of government are implemented[2].\nHerbert A. Simon and D.W Smithburg also consider public administration an executive tool in the government which performs the functions and the activities of the executive branches of the state, local governments, government corporations and certain other agencies of a specialized character. It is the area of study and practice where law and policy indorsed are carried out. Thus, public administration comprises of all those operations having for their purpose the fulfillment or enforcement of public policy[3].\nSimilarly, Luther Gulick also added that public administration is that measure of the science of administration which enact with the government, and thus concerns itself predominantly with the executive branch, where the work of government is done. That’s why it is continuously an active business inside the government concerned with carrying out the law as made by legislative bodies and interpreted by courts, through the process of organization and management. Hence, public administration is as much concerned with what government does as it is with how it does it[4].\nA. The evolution of Public Administration:\nThe history of public administration is a significant source of understanding of the administrative structure of the present and of the practicable and appropriate directions which its future evolution will or should take[5].\nIn medieval times, public administrators were as qualified as rulers and the educated elite in terms of abilities to read, write and calculate[6]. Lorenz von Stein, an 1855 German professor from Vienna, is associated with founding the science of Public Administration. He refused to be restricted to the definition that was given to Public Administration in his time as a form of administrative law; he rather showed that Public Administration draws on many pre-set disciplines such as sociology, political science, administrative law and public finance[7].\nThe earliest scholars who mention the identity of public administration are Woodrow Wilson and Goodnow, which also promote the issue of politic-administration dichotomy. During the early period of 20th century, the government system is reflected to be corrupted with patronages. Therefore, Wilson claimed that there should be a distinct separation between politics and administration, and Goodnow further determined that politics is the representation of people's will and administration is the execution of that will. They foresee a bureaucratic system with hieratical structure and formal rules and regulations, and expert administrators will perform faithfully according to the political system[8].\nThis notion give rise to the debate between Friedrik and Finer, where on one hand, Finer reflects in strict regulation that guard against administrators abuse the power and administrators should only emphasize on the technical issues, while Friedrik was arguing administrators are experts and should actively involve in the policymaking procedure[9]. In addition, such contradiction between politics and administration is also revisited by scholars Dwight Waldo and Herbert\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it appears that citizens can influence the executive branch through voting, public opinion, and lobbying.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nUrbanization during the Industrial Revolution was driven by several factors. The key drivers included technological advancements that led to increased production efficiency, leading to economic growth. This attracted people from rural areas to cities in search of jobs. Additionally, improvements in transportation infrastructure like railways made it easier to move goods and people, further fueling urban growth. However, to provide a more precise answer, I should verify these points.\n</think>\n\n<search>causes of urbanization during the industrial revolution</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"urbanization - Impact of the Industrial Revolution | Britannica\") urbanization\n-\nWhat does the term 'urbanization' mean?\n-\nWhy do people move from rural to urban areas?\n-\nWhat are some common features of urban areas?\n-\nHow does urbanization affect the environment?\n-\nWhat are some economic benefits of urbanization?\n-\nHow does urbanization differ across various countries?\n-\nWhat measures can be taken to make urbanization more sustainable?\nurbanization, the process by which large numbers of people become permanently concentrated in relatively small areas, forming cities.\nThe definition of what constitutes a city changes from time to time and place to place, but it is most usual to explain the term as a matter of demographics. The United Nations does not have its own definition of “urban” but instead follows the definitions used in each country, which may vary considerably. The United States, for instance, uses “urban place” to mean any locality where more than 2,500 people live. In Peru the term is applied to population centres with 100 or more dwellings.\nHistory\nWhatever the numerical definition, it is clear that the course of human history has been marked by a process of accelerated urbanization. It was not until the Neolithic Period, beginning at roughly 10,000 bce, that humans were able to form small permanent settlements. Cities of more than 100,000 did not exist until the time of Classical antiquity, and even those did not become common until the sustained population explosion of the last three centuries. In 1800 less than 3 percent of the world’s population was living in cities of 20,000 or more; this had increased to about one-quarter of the population by the mid-1960s. By the early 21st century more than half of the world’s population resided in urban centres.\nThe little towns of ancient civilizations, both in the Old World and the New, were only possible because of improvements in agriculture and transportation. As farming became more productive, it produced a surplus of food. The development of means of transportation, dating from the invention of the wheel about 3500 bce, made it possible for the surplus from the countryside to feed urban populations, a system that continues to the present day.\nDespite the small size of these villages, the people in early towns lived quite close together. Distances could be no greater than an easy walk, and nobody could live out of the range of the water supply. In addition, because cities were constantly subject to attack, they were quite often walled, and it was difficult to extend barricades over a large area. Archaeological excavations have suggested that the population density in the cities of 2000 bce may have been as much as 128,000 per square mile (49,400 per square km). By contrast, the present cities of Kolkata and Shanghai, with densities of more than 70,000 per square mile, are regarded as extremes of overcrowding.\nWith few exceptions, the elite—aristocrats, government officials, clergy, and the wealthy—lived in the centre of ancient cities, which was usually located near the most important temple. Farther out were the poor, who were sometimes displaced beyond the city walls altogether.\nThe greatest city of antiquity was Rome, which at its height in the 3rd century ce covered almost 4 square miles (10 square km) and had at least 800,000 inhabitants. To provide for this enormous population, the empire constructed a system of aqueducts that channeled drinking water from hills as far away as 44 miles (70 km). Inside the city itself, the water was pumped to individual homes through a remarkable network of conduits and lead pipes, the equal of which was not seen until the 20th century. As in most early cities, Roman housing was initially built from dried clay molded about wooden frameworks. As the city grew, it began to include structures made from mud, brick, concrete, and, eventually, finely carved marble.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Why is climate change happening and what are the causes ...\") , emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and cause land subsidence.

Second, while land use change is an important driver of climate change, a changing climate can lead to changes in land\nDoc 3(Title: \"What Causes Change in an Organization? 10 Factors Explored\") nd is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are environment-friendly in order to gain the loyalty and respect of their customers.\n3) Changed technology\nTechnology is one of the most important factors which force change in the organization, and organizations are required to adapt to these changing technologies in order to keep up with the competition.\nFor example, in the past times, all works like record keeping, order placement, etc. were being done manually, but in the present time with the help of computers, there is no need to perform these works manually.\nSimilarly, in the production process, there were many tasks which workers were supposed to perform with hands, but at present, with automation, all of these works are performed using machines, and this has not only reduced the man-error but also sped up the production process.\nNow customers have a platform to reach to the organization, and companies can respond to the queries made by customers quickly because of the presence of advanced technology.\nTherefore, companies are required to stay focused and make changes in technology whenever they require to stay relevant in the market.\n4) Social changes\nSocial change is also a crucial factor which causes a change in an organization. Companies are required to change their production process with the changes in the needs and aspirations of people.\nDemands of people vary on the basis of the social environment and the status of people — factors like level of education, international influence, urbanization cause social changes.\nFor example, the demands of people living in an urban area will be different from the demands of people living in rural areas. People living in an urban area don’t much care about the price of the product, but they care about the quality and services provided by the organization.\nWhereas, on the other hand, people living in rural areas are more concerned about the price of the product and care less about the quality of the product and they usually choose products cheapest among all available alternatives.\n5) Failure\nFailure is a factor which puts an end on the operations of some organization as these organizations take with shame and stops from taking risks with innovation ideas.\nHowever, there are some organizations which rather than sitting back and thinking about bankruptcy has taken failure as a challenge and worked hard to change the failure into success by analyzing their weak operations and the operations which were not working well for them and changed them in order to proceed towards success.\nA common example that everyone is aware of is the success story of Apple company. Steve Jobs, the founder of the company, was driven out of the company because of his aggressive behavior, and the company started losing its business after Steve left the company.\nSteve was hired back by the company in 1997, and now we all know how his alliance with the Apple company has proved beneficial for it.\nAt present Apple is one of the largest companies in the world. Steve was not intimidated by the failure, but he has trust in his skills and vision. He took the company in his hands when it is at its lowest and take it to the peak of success.\nSimilarly, there are several examples of companies which took failure as a lesson and worked hard to become successful companies again. However, sailing through tough times is not a cup of tea of every organization, emerging from failure requires strength, vision, and a tremendous amount of hard work.\n6) Competitive innovation\nCompetitive innovation forces companies to change.

These types include:\n- Poor Financial Performance\n- Internal Crisis (such as a strike)\n- Changes in Employee Expectations\nMost companies, at one time or another, are faced with poor financial performance. This, in turn, causes significant changes that need to be made in order to help the company. Changes can consist of selling products, moving locations, hiring new management or even laying off employees. Cheapo Toys relies on producing the hot toy for the holiday season. If their toys are not popular with the kids, then drastic changes usually have to occur to save finances. Last year, for example, Cheapo Toys moved their headquarters from New York to Ashville, North Carolina, to save money. Many of the employees did not make the move and had to find work elsewhere.\nSometimes internal crises occur within the company that are unforeseen. For example, Cheapo's factory workers went on strike a few months ago to protest an expired contract and to request higher wages. This crisis caused a huge drop in toy production, which resulted in Cheapo having to sell their stuffed toy division for additional money to stay afloat during the strike.\nChanges in employee expectations is the third internal force of change. Employees today want flexible work time, the ability to work from home and excellent working conditions. This change in expectations has led many companies to offer an all-in-one corporate office to keep employees happy on site. Companies have free gyms, doctor's offices and even daycare available on site.\nPlanned and unplanned are the two types of changes that can occur with an organization. Planned changes occur when deliberate decisions are made in an organization, while unplanned change is a result of unforeseen occurrences. External factors and internal factors can cause both of these types of changes within a company. External forces of change are globalization, workforce diversity, ethical behavior and technology. Internal forces of change consist of poor financial performance, internal crises or a change in worker expectations.\nChanges in Organizations: Thought Exercises\nResearch Projects\n1.

In four words: we-are-doing-it. Let’s analyze the causes and discover 5 simple actions to take to save animals from extinction.\nRecent studies are launching the alarm: we are on the verge of the sixth mass extinction.\nToday, extinction rates are increasing, and this is only humans’ fault. According to a study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a total of 515 animal species are fading away. Likewise, Associations such as WWF are making the same appeal. We must do something, otherwise – by 2050 – polar bears, penguins and many more other animal species, will be only a far distant memory.\nDo you remember the Giant Panda, the Tamarow, and the Iberian Lynx? Forget about them: they are included in the list of animals on the brink of extinction. You won’t even be able to recall how they look like, in a few years time. Extinction will wipe them out, as if they had never existed.\nBut, while stressing the importance of acting now, the associations launching the appeal are also drawing attention to one important fact connected to animal extinction. While the other 5 mass extinctions were the consequence of all-natural geological causes, the current mass extinction is completely caused by men…by us.\nThe current extinction crisis (yes, it is a crisis… not a change!) is the consequence of many human-induced factors – which often combine. Some of them include habitat degradation (through poisoning, logging, urbanization), over-exploitation (overfishing and unsustainable agriculture), climate change and pollution, illegal hunting and illegal wildlife trafficking… and unfortunately, the list could go on.\n“The sixth mass extinction we are going through could be the most serious environmental threat to the survival of our civilization since it is irreversible” – experts say. By killing them, we are actually killing ourselves.\n5 Steps to Prevent Animal Extinction\nHowever, have you ever thought that we are the problem, and also the potential solution? We have the power to stop animal extinction, and we must act now. Everyone can make a change, small may it be, to protect not only the animals, but the whole environment (including ourselves).\nYou won’t have a second chance, extinction is forever: starting from today you must take action. So why don’t you begin by following this 5-steps guide to prevent animal extinction? It is easy, convenient, and you won’t regret.\nBear this in mind: small actions can lead to great changes.\n1. Buy Eco-Friendly Products\nWork for more environmentally-friendly (or at least more environmentally conscious) habits. First of all, beware and be aware of what you buy, and what you use. Always avoid buying potentially damaging products for the environment: avoid large corporations’ products that involve resources and processes which have a harmful impact on the animals – and especially on the endangered ones.\nThis also applies to cosmetics: avoid products made by companies that test their products on animals. Remember: we must stop animal testing, they don’t know the answer!\nWhen buying, you must read the labels on the packaging, in order to make sure the production process of that item did not involve any animal testing, nor environmentally dangerous practices.\nAlso, always make sure the producer company of each product you buy, work in an environmentally sustainable way – being it food, clothes, or its packaging in general. This will help in saving animals’ habitats, especially those of endangered species. In doing so, you will prevent animal extinction.\n2. Follow The 3-R Rule: Recycle, Reuse, Reduce\nSeparate and treat the discarded solid waste of the manufacture of new products. Come on, get creative! Recycle paper and cardboard, plastic, metals, glass and all the rest: you will be able to create new, fantastic objects.\nPlastic waste is a potential threat for the environment, and this includes its accumulation on the Earth surface. Beside being a powerful pollutant for the e\nDoc 2(Title: \"A 5 steps guide to prevent animal extinction - Ecobnb\") ome on, get creative! Recycle paper and cardboard, plastic, metals, glass and all the rest: you will be able to create new, fantastic objects.\nPlastic waste is a potential threat for the environment, and this includes its accumulation on the Earth surface. Beside being a powerful pollutant for the environment as a whole, it can negatively affect wildlife habitat – whether in the ocean or amongst nature.\nThe Recycling rule, applies especially for the products you buy. Make sure the packaging of your purchases (as well as its content) is made from recycled materials. Look for the special logo, and carry on with your purchase only if you see it! Also, have you ever tried second-hand products? If not, you should make it up: give it a try. It could be key in slowing down animal extinction.\nThe 3-R rule also applies to a more sustainable life in general: every small energy-saving change can have a huge impact on the health of threatened animals.\nFor example, by reducing the carbon footprint you may be able to help the environment, and improve your health at the same time.\nSmall actions, big changes\nstart by reducing the quantity of energy and fossil fuel you and your family use during the day. There are several ways of doing so:\n- Replace light bulbs, switching to energy saving ones – such as fluorescent bulbs (if you can’t find them in supermarkets, which seems really odd today, online shopping can help). In fact, fluorescent lightbulbs can work by using less fossil fuel than conventional lightbulbs.\n- Use a laptop instead of using a desktop computer when possible: laptops consume up to 5 times less!\n- On your bike!? Bike to work instead of driving. And guess what, you won’t only reduce air pollution, but this will also have a positive impact on your wallet, and on your health.\n- When leaving home, or at nighttime, make sure you turn off the heat and unplug the electronic facilities you have. Switching them off is not enough: you must unplug your laptop cords, your television, your phone charger, and even the kettle and the toaster in your kitchen. Did you know that even if you are not actually using these electronic gadgets, they still sap energy, just by being plugged in?\nBy following these tips you will be able to save not only energy and money, but you will also save the life of many endangered species.\n3. Don’t Buy Souvenirs Made From Endangered Species\nIf you do so, you are not only risking a fine, you are also increasing extinction rates. Stay away from products made from endangered (but also still-not-so-endangered) species!\nI see, you would really love to buy some iconic souvenirs on holiday, maybe to remind your family and friends the gorgeous places you visited – like a tropical beach or a South African Resort. But even if it doesn’t seem so, by making that purchase, you are actually increasing extinction rates (besides supporting illegal trading in poaching of wildlife!).\nThese products are filled with cruelty and pain, for the animals who suffered in the production process.\nThe illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth billions and billions of dollars each year. And if on the one hand it is mostly controlled by criminal gangs, it is also very much supported by the hundreds of millions of people going on foreign holidays and buying this type of souvenirs.\nThese items include materials such as tortoiseshell, ivory, reptile skins, furs, coral. Also, try to step into the animals’ shoes: have you ever thought that no one else needs a fur but a tiger? And, that no one else needs a rhino horn but a rhino? Or, that no one else needs a tortoiseshell but a tortoise?\nThink this through, you know the answer.\n4. Eat Less Meat\nBe greener! We are literally “eating our way to extinction”. The meat industry is not only damaging farmed animals, but also wild ones – and especially the ones in danger of extinction. Studies warn that meat-eaters are actually speeding worldwide animals extinction.\nBy killing them, we are killing ourse\nDoc 3(Title: \"A 5 steps guide to prevent animal extinction - Ecobnb\") eener! We are literally “eating our way to extinction”. The meat industry is not only damaging farmed animals, but also wild ones – and especially the ones in danger of extinction. Studies warn that meat-eaters are actually speeding worldwide animals extinction.\nBy killing them, we are killing ourselves\nOur appetite for beef, for dairy, for fish is wiping out animals, and even threatening our own survival.\n“You eat a steak, you kill a lemur in Madagascar. You eat a chicken, you kill an Amazonian parrot”, says geophysicist expert Gidon Eshel, in order to make people realise the full impact of meat consumption on biodiversity.\nBeef, dairy, and fishing industries are today the leading cause of extinction. This also connects to the loss of habitat due to land clearing, but also overfishing and pollution.\nFirst, the vast majority of land clearing is to graze cattle for the meat industry, and to raise crops to feed farmed animals. Can you imagine that currently almost one-third of our planet’s surface is used for these purposes alone, and that this trend is even increasing? This is crazy. Almost 80% of former Amazon forests are now used for grazing cattle for meat.\nBy doing this, we are not only destroying the natural habitat of countless animals, but we are also destroying the ‘lungs of the Earth’, and as a consequence our own life.\nFor what concerns fishing, the greatest extinction danger is over-exploitation: in other words, we are fishing them to extinction in order to satisfy our needs.\nIn addition, many experts have explored the links between modern livestock production and other issues such as climate change and pollution; which eventually lead to animal extinction. For example, animal agriculture is responsible for almost 15% of climate emissions on a world scale, more than all the cars, trains, and planes.\nMeat-eaters are supporting the unsustainable production practices of the meat industry, and as a consequences they are speeding worldwide species extinction rate. We must change the way we eat and produce ‘food’: the current situation is having a catastrophic impact on almost all animal species across the globe.\nEvery meal counts\nBy eating less meat – whether one day a week or one meal a day – you will lower your dietary carbon footprint and take a step to protect wildlife.\nIf you change your eating habits, you will change the agricultural food market. This will result in more sustainable industries – because the meat demand-supply relation will be changed forever. It is simple: if you don’t demand, they won’t produce.\nA plant-based diet (or at least a diet which involves reducing the amount of meat and fish you eat) is one of the easiest, yet stronger ways, to use our planet’s resources more responsibly, and protect animals at the same time. In addition, plant-based food uses less water, have a lower impact on the environment, and guess what…it’s delicious.\nSo why don’t you save a Lemur and a Parrot today?!\n5. Spread Awareness: get involved\nTell the world! Let’s Stop the sixth mass extinction.\nTalk to your family and friends. If you can’t convince them to change their habits, at least try to warn them, and make them more aware of their actions. Start by spreading the advantages of buying eco-friendly products, of eating less meat, and of buying souvenir-greeting-cards when on holiday!\nLast but not least, be a voice for endangered species on social media: share posts, reels, tag your followers. Social media are also a great way of getting informed, and eventually, take more direct action. Stand for animals! together we can stop animal extinction.\nIn a nutshell: the next endangered species is literally us\nMass extinction seems a long way away, but actually, it is just around the corner. And even if you don’t care about endangered species, and you don’t love animals (which is basically impossible) this is not an excuse to sit back and watch. You still must act. In fact, if endangered species actually become extinct, many se\nDoc 4(Title: \"A 5 steps guide to prevent animal extinction - Ecobnb\") long way away, but actually, it is just around the corner. And even if you don’t care about endangered species, and you don’t love animals (which is basically impossible) this is not an excuse to sit back and watch. You still must act. In fact, if endangered species actually become extinct, many serious consequences will follow.\nIn short, biodiversity is not just important because animals are nice to look at (although, if you are an animal lover, this is a bonus point to convince you!)…But beyond their beauty, each of these animal species is part of a whole system.\nIf you remove one part of the system, the system is no longer in balance, and will eventually collapse. In the long run this will lead to the extinction of every single species, including the human one.\nWe must stop this terrifying ripple effect because our own survival is at risk. Nature, and the ecosystems of plants and animals that live within it, is literally what is keeping us alive.\nAnd this is why you should care about animal extinction.\nSo what are you doing today to extinguish extinction? Save them, save yourself.\nFeatured image: Photo by Hans-Jurgen Mager on Unsplash\nDoc 5(Title: \"How Can We Help Save Animals From Extinction? - Blue and ...\") Environment\nHow Can We Help Save Animals From Extinction?\nWe teamed up with Simon Jeffery – Animal Manager at Port Lympne Reserve, Kent – to explore some pressing questions surrounding animal conservation. Here are our findings…\nWhich species are declining fastest?\nBig species like rhino are being poached in mass because of their horns – 1500 black rhinos were killed last year alone. Back in the 70’s and 80’s rhino’s horns were traded up the Yemen in East Africa, where they could then be made into ornamental handles for daggers. The West African black rhino is now recognised as extinct, as officially declared in 2011; the rhino was listed as critically endangered in 2008 and since, their numbers have fallen dramatically due a number of threatening factors. Although poaching is the most pressing cause of rhino decline, habitat loss also plays a large part in their rapidly decreasing numbers\nLions are one of the most recent species to have gained Endangered Species Act Protection. The new protection rules will address trophy hunts, like the one that killed the famous Cecil the lion earlier this year, to prevent the rapidly declining numbers of the African Lion.\nPhoto courtesy of the Aspinall Foundation\nGorillas are poached for trophy hunting and the bush meat trade. Such killing has reduced wildlife populations in general by up to 80% in some national parks. Deforestation also plays a huge part in the gorilla species’ decline. Smaller species are also affected by deforestation, such as monkeys, who have nowhere else to go and are hunted for bushmeat, especially in mining areas.\nPhoto courtesy of the Aspinall Foundation\nTo help these animals, people can donate to species preservation charities. At the Aspinall Foundation, we help protect forest and land across Africa and the world. It’s also massively helpful to buy ethically (fair trade products, for example) and make sure sustainable palm oil is used in your daily shopping; numerous websites will highlight sustainable palm oil products. Also, you should always recycle where possible!\nWhat can we do to help prevent the extinction of various species and deforestation of our planet?\nNot only does preventing deforestation give us a chance to preserve animals and wildlife communities, but it’s also the quickest way to stop global warming and the resulting climate change.\nTo stop climate change, renewable energy needs to be implemented in as many ways and places as possible. We need to recycle and shop ethically – this includes purchasing products which contain sustainable palm oil. Palm oil is one of the biggest causes of deforestation. If we continue to buy products that are recycled or support brands with zero deforestation policies, then cumulatively, we can show big companies and corporations that they, too, need to be a part of the effort to stop deforestation. If you’re buying wood products, look for Forest Stewardship Council Certification (FSC) on wood and wood products.\nPhoto credit: Michael Porter\nPhoto credit: Michael Porter\nWhat would you like to see more of in the hope to prevent the extinction of some of the planet’s most beautiful animals?

Fewer and fewer colleges are giving class rank much importance. According to the NACAC, fewer than half of high schools now track class rank.\nPersonal qualities. Some colleges look for signs of certain personal traits that they feel help students succeed in college, such as curiosity, social consciousness, or persistence. You might be able to get an idea of which traits your colleges value by reviewing their admissions websites and mission statements, or by asking an admissions counselor or current student what types of students succeed at the school. See 9 Personality and Character Traits Colleges Look for in Applicants.\nDo all colleges use the same criteria when admitting students?\nColleges don’t all consider the same factors when deciding whether or not to admit prospective students. Talk to a college counselor to learn about what your school of choice considers before accepting students. This can help you be prepared for college applications and interviews. Listed below are some examples.\n- Liberal arts colleges, which encourage students to study broadly, may give factors such as essays and demonstrated interest considerable weight.\n- Highly selective colleges attract thousands of outstanding students. These colleges typically look to the \"next-most important\" factors to make their decisions.\n- At very large universities, some admission decisions may be made solely based on GPA and test scores.\nColleges consider many factors when admitting students. Remember that different colleges take different factors into consideration during the admissions process. After learning more about these college admission secrets, do some research about the schools you are applying to and find new ways to stand out!\nDoc 2(Title: \"What Do Colleges Look For in Students? | CollegeData\") What Do Colleges Look For in Students?\nIt may seem top secret, but colleges are perfectly willing to reveal their most important admission factors. You just need to know where to look.\nColleges typically consider grades in tough courses most important in admissions. But what else do colleges look for? According to the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC), colleges list the following admission factors as the most important.\nWhat are the Most Important Factors in College Admissions?\n-\nGrades in college prep courses. Most colleges will consider your grade in college prep courses the strongest sign of your ability to do well in college. If you perform well in your AP courses, it suggests that you have the ability to take on the college workload. Even if you struggled early in your high school career, colleges will look favorably upon strong improvement in subsequent years.\n-\nStrength of curriculum. Colleges look for students who took the most challenging courses available to them who performed well in each class. Some high schools don’t offer many college prep classes. If that is the case for your high school, admissions officers will take this into account. They may also look favorably upon students who seek challenge outside of school; for example, by taking community college courses or AP courses online.\n- Admission test scores. Your SAT and/or ACT scores might count highly if the college requires or accepts them. Many colleges are now test optional, test flexible, or test blind. Scores from AP tests and the International Baccalaureate exams may also be important, especially to more selective colleges. To best prepare for your tests take a college test prep course or buy a prep book. This will help you study and determine the best way for you to conquer your test and receive the best score possible.\n- Grades in all courses. Your overall GPA also serves as an indicator of your academic success in high school. Colleges may look at your transcript to get an idea of how you performed in your classes. A transcript is a list of every class taken throughout high school and the grade received in each class. Some colleges will also look at the types of classes you took in high school and note whether you took honors and AP courses if they were available.\nHow to Get Into a Good College: The Next Most Important Factors\nExtracurricular commitment. Colleges pay attention to your involvement in extracurricular activities. But what counts most to colleges is how long and how deeply you have been committed to one or two of those interests. This could be sports, clubs, music groups, or various other activities. They take into account the leadership roles you have held, what you accomplished, and how much time you committed to the activity.\nLetters of recommendation. Many colleges require recommendation letters from your teachers and high school counselor. Other colleges may require additional letters from individuals who know you well and can provide insight into your academic abilities, character, and personality.\nEssay or writing sample. Many colleges will ask you to submit an essay or personal statement and some will require you to answer additional questions with shorter essays. Here is your opportunity to put your personality into your application. A well-written essay can tip a decision in your favor and a poorly written one can do the opposite.\nDemonstrated interest. Going on a college visit, talking with admission officers, or doing an enthusiastic interview can call attention to how much you really want to attend. Applying for an early decision may also make a good impression.\nClass rank. Colleges that use this factor want to see how much competition high school students had to face to achieve rank.

Of course, all colleges are different and IECA members can be particularly helpful in understanding those variances.\nAmong the key 2020 findings:\n- While grades are important (#2 in rankings), colleges want to see students challenging themselves, willing to risk perfect GPAs by taking courses that will demonstrate a willingness to take chances, including AP and IB coursework (#1).\n- Despite all the talk about “test optional,” scores on standardized tests like the SAT and ACT remain critical (#3)\n- Extra-curriculars rose to their highest level ever in the IECA rankings (#4), but colleges look for a long-term, passionate, authentic involvement in one or two activities whether in or out of school. No one is impressed by a long list of tangential clubs. In fact, jumping two spots (to #6) this year: demonstration of leadership within those chosen few activities.\n- Essays remain important and are even more important at smaller colleges. But students misunderstand their role. Yes, clear and cogent writing matters, but a great essay is one that tells a story, giving insight into a student’s unique personality. There’s a great saying—no one else should be able to write the essay you submit for admission.\n- Coming together are four items that speak to the question: what can YOU do for US? Colleges wonder how the student will contribute to campus life: through unique characteristics or demographics (#7), through special talents (#9), through interest in research (#10), and through demonstrations of a student’s character and values (#11).\n- How does a student demonstrate all those? Through the essay, the activities list, and through recommendations, which turned up as #8 on the 2020 rankings.\n- Finally, an area students often don’t understand is demonstration of interest and enthusiasm in attending (#12). Are you following the college on Facebook? Did you visit the campus? Seek an interview? Colleges don’t like to extend an offer of admission to a student who will go elsewhere, so when you decide on your first choice, let them know!\nThis ranked list is based on a 2020 nationwide survey of IECA member independent educational consultants.\nJust as every college is different, so too are the criteria and priorities in each college’s admission process.

Like any significant goal, achieving this is more manageable when broken into smaller action items.\nHere are eight steps you can take to improve your organization’s profitability.\nFree E-Book: A Manager's Guide to Finance & Accounting\nAccess your free e-book today.\nDOWNLOAD NOWHow to Improve Profitability: 8 Steps for Managers\n1. Learn to Read Financial Statements\nThe first step is to familiarize yourself with three key financial statements: the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Here are several resources to get started:\n- The Beginner’s Guide to Reading & Understanding Financial Statements\n- Balance Sheets 101: What Goes On a Balance Sheet?\n- How to Read & Understand a Balance Sheet\n- How to Read & Understand an Income Statement\n- How to Read & Understand a Cash Flow Statement\nDetermine which pieces of these statements you can control as a manager. A baseline understanding of the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement can give you a clearer picture of what your business is spending and earning, and lead to productive conversations with other decision-makers about budgeting and efficiencies.\n2. Calculate the Profitability of Future Projects\nOne way to gauge the impact you can have on your company’s financial health is to calculate projects’ predicted profitability. There are three metrics to consider when doing so: net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period.\nThe net present value (NPV) is the amount of money a particular investment is worth to your organization today. This calculation takes both the time value of money—the concept that your money is worth more now than the same amount is in the future—and the inherent risk of investment into consideration. If a project’s NPV is a positive number, the project is expected to be profitable.\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that sets the NPV equal to zero. In other words, when using the IRR, your project would neither be profitable nor losing money. Your project’s discount rate must be lower than its IRR to be profitable.\nFor instance, if you were to find that the IRR for a project is three percent, but the project’s discount rate is five percent, you can predict that the project will not be profitable and pivot accordingly.\nThe payback period is how long an investment will take to pay back the initial cost. It’s useful to know how quickly you expect to see a return on your investment when pitching projects and planning budgets.\nRelated: Financial Terminology: 20 Financial Terms to Know\n3. Find Efficiencies in Your Processes\nAnalyze your company’s income statement and notice the expenses. Are there any items that can be eliminated by streamlining processes? Which line items do you have control over, and can any be reduced or eliminated? Conducting an audit of your expenses and pruning away process inefficiencies are necessary steps toward improving your company’s profitability.\n4. Create Budgets and Stick to Them\nKnowing how to create a budget is an essential skill for managers. Familiarize yourself with your firm’s budgeting timeline, procedures, and financial statements so you can create a budget that equips your team to complete projects that drive profitability and performance.\nTrack each action item your team completes so you can compare your actual spending against projected costs. This can allow you to learn from mistakes and make better financial decisions moving forward.\n5.

Change happens in every organization, and every organization is required to adapt to that change to maintain its position in the market. There are various factors which cause a change in the organization.\nEffective business management requires to have an awareness of the factors which can cause a change in the organization. Knowing the factors which cause change helps a manager to take decisions accordingly, which helps the organization grow and reduces the chances of loss.\nIn this article, you will learn about the different factors which cause changes in an organization.\nTable of Contents\nFactors that cause a change in an organization\n1) Change in governmental policies\nNo matter whether your organization is a public organization or a private organization government has control on it; however, the percentage of control varies.\nHave you ever wondered how specific businesses have thrived amidst constant organizational change?\nQuick Statistics: According to a study by McKinsey & Company, over 70% of change management efforts within organizations fail. However, companies that engage in active communication and employee involvement during change processes have 30% higher success rates in implementing changes efficiently. This highlights the critical importance of open communication in successful organizational transformations. (Source: McKinsey & Company, 2023)\nBrief Case Studies: A notable example is Netflix, which successfully transformed its business model from DVD rentals to a leading streaming service. By continuously innovating and diving into content creation, Netflix increased its subscriber base from 23 million in 2011 to over 200 million in 2023. This shift not only improved customer engagement but also allowed Netflix to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing digital environment. (Source: Netflix Earnings Reports)\nGovernment policies decide the way an organization operates and what it can produce and not. For example, recently in India government has banned the use of certain types of plastic and because of this policy.\nThe operations of many organizations have changed as they are needed to make changes in the plastic. Similarly, there are various policies like employment hire policy, wages policy, and rights of employees and workers are controlled by the organization and the organizations are required to abide by these policies to be able to operate freely.\nFor example, in India, there is a policy that a minimum of 30% of the total employees of an organization should be women. This forces organizations to hire woman employees.\n2) Change in market demand\nAnother important factor which causes a change in an organization is the changing demand of the market. Gone are the days when people are required to accustom themselves because of the products provided by the companies because, at that time, they did not have many options to choose from.\nIn modern times, there are several options available for one product in the market, and people have the freedom to choose from any of the product, and they have become less loyal for brands. They buy products from an organization which provides them a good quality of products at the lowest prices.\nBecause of this reason, companies are required to stay on their toes and change fast in order to facilitate the changing requirements of their customers.\nFor examples, in the era of the internet, people prefer to shop online rather than shopping from a physical store. Therefore, organizations are required to take their businesses online so that they can fulfill the changing demand of their customers.\nHere is another example of a change in the market demand is that now, more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues.\nTherefore, they want to use products which are environment-friendly or are good for the environment. This has forced many organizations to change their production process and also products. They sell products which are\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, here are steps a manager can take to determine whether their firm needs improvement in control and how to improve each type of control:\n\n1. **Conduct Internal Audits**:\n   - Regularly review financial and operational processes to identify gaps and weaknesses.\n   - Use checklists and templates to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n2. **Analyze Incidents of Fraud or Error**:\n   - Investigate any incidents thoroughly to understand root causes.\n   - Implement corrective actions and preventive measures based on findings.\n\n3. **Check for Compliance Issues**:\n   - Ensure the firm complies with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards.\n   - Stay updated with regulatory changes and adjust controls accordingly.\n\n4. **Gather Employee Feedback**:\n   - Conduct surveys to understand employee perceptions of control and identify areas for improvement.\n   - Address concerns and suggestions through regular communication and feedback mechanisms.\n\n5. **Evaluate Performance Metrics**:\n   - Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess control effectiveness.\n   - Set benchmarks and targets to track progress over time.\n\n6. **Implement Financial Controls**:\n   - Review and update financial reporting processes.\n   - Ensure accurate record-keeping and segregation of duties.\n\n7. **Enhance Operational Controls**:\n   - Streamline workflows and eliminate redundancies.\n   - Use technology and automation to improve efficiency and accuracy.\n\n8. **Strengthen Structural Controls**:\n   - Define roles and responsibilities clearly.\n   - Establish clear lines of authority and accountability.\n\n9. **Develop Strategic Controls**:\n   - Align business strategies with control objectives.\n   - Monitor and adjust controls to support strategic goals.\n\nBy following these steps, a manager can systematically assess and improve the control systems within their firm.",

Capitalism is often praised for its efficiency, innovation, and the ability to provide a wide range of goods and services. However, it also faces criticism for issues such as inequality, environmental degradation, and potential monopolies.\n\nCapitalism is often seen as the best economic system because it:\n\n1. **Encourages Innovation and Growth**: Competition drives businesses to innovate and improve their products and services to attract customers and stay profitable. This leads to technological advancements and economic growth.\n2. **Provides Unlimited Opportunity**: In a capitalist system, individuals can theoretically achieve success regardless of their social background, provided they work hard and make wise choices.\n3. **Efficiency**: Prices and resource allocation are determined by supply and demand, which helps ensure that goods and services are produced where they are most needed.\n\nHowever, capitalism also has significant drawbacks:\n\n1. **Inequality**: Capitalism tends to exacerbate wealth and income disparities, as those with more resources have more opportunities to accumulate more.\n2. **Environmental Issues**: The focus on profit can sometimes lead to environmental damage if regulations are not stringent enough.\n3. **Monopolies**: Large corporations can dominate markets, limiting competition and stifling innovation.\n\nGiven these points, while capitalism has many strengths, it is not without its flaws.

(This is important to distinguish capitalism from anarchism, where there is absolutely no government present)\nFeatures of a capitalist economic system\n- Economic freedom. Individuals free to set up business and provide the goods and services they want.\n- Consumer sovereignty. Consumers free to decide which goods and services to purchase.\n- Limited government. Government intervention limited to the protection of private property and provision of public goods.\n- Finance sector. Capitalism requires a developed banking and financial system which can provide loans to companies and banking services to households.\n- Profit motive is seen as important for enabling an efficient distribution of resources and encouraging innovation and responsive markets.\n- Market forces. Goods and services are distributed according to ‘the invisible hand of the market’ – in other words, the allocation of goods is determined by market forces. For example, if demand rises, firms have an incentive to increase supply.\n- Flexible labour markets – easy to hire and fire workers.\n- Free trade. Low tariff barriers to encourage international trade.\nFriedman on Capitalism\n“There is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use it resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud”\n― Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (1962)\nExamples of capitalist economies\nAccording to this rank of countries by ‘economic freedom’.

She is an expert on the U.S. and world economies. learn about our editorial policies Updated on August 31, 2024 In This Article View All In This Article Characteristics How Capitalism Works Advantages of Capitalism Disadvantages of Capitalism Capitalism and Democracy Examples Capitalism vs. Socialism Capitalism vs. Communism Capitalism vs. Fascism Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Photo: kali9 / E+ / Getty Images Close Capitalism is an economic system where private entities own the factors of production. The four factors are entrepreneurship, capital goods, natural resources, and labor. The owners of capital goods, natural resources, and entrepreneurship exercise control through companies. Individuals own their labor. In theory, the system may sound simple, but in practice, it’s much more complicated and can have both positive and negative effects. Here’s how capitalism works and the advantages and disadvantages of this economic system. What Is Capitalism? Capitalistic ownership means owners control the factors of production and derive their income from their ownership. That gives them the ability to operate their companies efficiently. It also provides them with the incentive to maximize profit. In corporations, the shareholders are the owners. Their level of control depends on how many shares they own. The shareholders elect a board of directors and hire upper-level executives to manage the company. Capitalism requires a free market economy in order to succeed. It distributes goods and services according to the laws of supply and demand. The law of demand says that when demand increases for a particular product, its price rises. When competitors realize that they can make a higher profit, they increase production. The greater supply reduces prices to a level where only the best competitors remain. Note Capitalism’s priorities of growth, profits, and the discovery of new markets often come at the expense of other factors, such as worker quality of life, and the environment. Capitalism emerged during the 16th century and accelerated during the Industrial Revolution, propelled by colonialism, the nascent factory system, and the Atlantic Slave Trade. While the system generated wealth and prestige for owners, it often did so by exploiting those with little to no power, such as factory workers and people indigenous to Africa and the Americas. Capitalism’s expansion in 19th-century America relied on economic growth generated through the labor of enslaved people on land forcefully taken from Native Americans. How Capitalism Works The owners of supply compete against each other to earn the highest profit. They sell their goods at the highest possible price while keeping their costs as low as possible. Competition keeps prices moderate and production efficient, although it can also lead to worker exploitation and poor labor conditions, especially in countries without strict labor laws. Another component of capitalism is the free operation of the capital markets. The laws of supply and demand set fair prices for stocks, bonds, derivatives, currency, and commodities. Capital markets allow companies to raise funds to expand. Laissez-faire economic theory argues that government should take a hands-off approach to capitalism and should intervene only to maintain a level playing field. The government's role is to protect the free market. It should prevent the unfair advantages obtained by monopolies or oligarchies. It ought to prevent the manipulation of information, making sure it is distributed equitably. Part of protecting the market is keeping order with national defense. The government should also maintain infrastructure, and it taxes capital gains and income to pay for these goals. Global governmental bodies adjudicate international trade.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Why Capitalism is the Best Economics System\") Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership in which activities are primarily determined by the function of a free market rather than by central government planning.1\nBe aware that when I speak of capitalism, I am referring to what is known as laissez-faire, meaning 'allow to do'. In other words, an economy with little government intervention. The U.S. is currently under a system known as a mixed economy, which is basically a mixture of capitalism and socialism. Capitalism works well because of the way it deals with self-interest, distributes limited resources, grows standards of living, and provides incentives for excellence. We will discuss these four concepts in detail:\nSelf-Interest\n\"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interests.\" -Adam Smith\nThe prevailing interest among humans in this world is self-interest. Anti-capitalists call it greed. Religion calls it sin. Science calls it survival. In fact, few philosophies refer to self interest in itself as something good, but it is inescapable. You cannot educate people out of self-interest. It is the natural order of human behavior and the only way to tame this beast is to work with it. Dr. Walter E. Williams describes how capitalism works with self-interest:\n\"Capitalism is relatively new in human history. Prior to capitalism, the way people amassed great wealth was by looting, plundering and enslaving their fellow man. Capitalism made it possible to become wealthy by serving your fellow man.\" 2\nDon't take this as an argument that capitalism is perfect or produces perfect results. Far from it. However, capitalism is the closest thing to a perfect economic system we will ever see on this earth.\nLimited Resources\nThere are a limited number of resources in the world. Therefore, a system is needed that rations out these resources in a manner that benefits all the stakeholders. As we discussed in Gas Shortages previously, prices determined through supply and demand allow resources to be allocated to those who need them most. In the case of a crisis, the person with an empty tank of gas can buy what he currently needs most (because the price will be high enough to deter people who don't really need it).\nStandard of Living\nWhile political rhetoric often describes dire economic conditions and the woes of class separation, the truth is, people have access to more products and services than ever before. There are many ways to gauge the current standard of living, but let's discuss a few related to \"the poor\". Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation3 wrote using 1990 census data:\n- 38 percent of the persons whom the Census Bureau identifies as \"poor\" own their own homes with a median value of $39,200.\n- 62 percent of \"poor\" households own a car; 14 percent own two or more cars.\n- Nearly half of all \"poor\" households have air-conditioning; 31 percent have microwave ovens.\n- Nationwide, some 22,000 \"poor\" households have heated swimming pools or Jacuzzis.\nExcellence\nCapitalism is the only economic system in the world that promotes voluntary excellence in individuals. Individuals are rewarded based on the amount of value they provide to the market. Capitalism provides incentives to be great and invent things that were never thought possible. It is a system that promotes growth among individuals and society as a whole.\nWhile it would be impossible here to fully explain all the reasons why capitalism is the best economic system in this post, there are many books devoted to this endeavor. Some of these books include:\n- Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman\n- The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith\n- Free to Choose by Milton Friedman and Rose Friedman\n- The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism by Robert Murphy\n- Freedomnomics by John Lott\nSources:\n1. Capitalism. Wikipedia.\n2. Capitalism and the Common Man. Walter E. Williams. August 25, 1997.\n3. How \"Poor\" are America's Poor? R\nDoc 4(Title: \"Economics Paper: Why Capitalism Is the Best Economical System?\") The collapse of Feudalism in the late 16th century ushered about a world crossroads. The economic microcosm characterized by the family farm was expanding beyond known borders and rapidly crossing into unknown economic territory. The methods in which individuals acquired and sold goods shifted to mercantilism, which in turn formed the root basis of the capitalist model successfully utilized by many countries today (Wood). Capitalism is the paramount economic system because it provides limitless opportunity, encourages innovation, and has not been proven inferior to alternative economic systems.\nFirst and foremost, capitalist economic systems provide limitless opportunity for each individual. Capitalism is the only economic system which allows every individual an equal chance of success, regardless of inherited social class. Motivation for success hinges on the guarantee that there are no limitations on the acquisition of wealth. The guaranteed chance of success provided by capitalism inspires hard work, perseverance, and hope.\nMoreover, capitalism results in an overall increase of innovation and economic growth. In a capitalist driven economic system, consumers make decisions, or votes, on preferences for products and services. The providers of goods and services are therefore motivated to create the best product to win the consumer. Constant competition results directly in pressure for the producer to continually increase the quality of the product while maintaining price. In this way, the power that capitalism inherently bestows to the consumer drives a force for innovation. Without capitalism, innovation is not a priority. In addition to expanding markets, innovation also further increases efficiency, reinforcing and adding to the feedback loop. In recent years, innovation within capitalist economies has increased so rapidly that it has spurred the emergence of an entirely new economic doctrine. This doctrine, dubbed “innovation economics,” centers all economic models around innovation and entrepreneurship, as opposed to traditional models, which are based on public policy. Proponents of the innovation economy predict that exponential growth of capitalist economies is not only feasible, but probable (Schramm et al.).\nWinston Churchill, a British politician, was famously recorded stating that “democracy is the worst form of government, except all those others that have been tried” (Raymond). Similarly, capitalism is considered by many to be the best economic system by default due simply to the absence of a more successful model. Modern countries attempting variations of the communist economic system struggle to reach the standard of living which most capitalist countries have achieved (Malik). These countries are often plagued by governmental corruption and lack of motivation among workers. For example, the Chinese Communist Party was recently ranked 78th of 178 countries in the Transparency International’s Corruption Perception index. This ranking is the worst among comparable developed countries (“Corruption Perceptions Index 2013”). The communist USSR under Stalin’s rule suffered heavily due to shortages in basic consumer goods such as food and hygiene products. These shortages were attributed to a lack of motivation among workers to reach outrageous government production quotas (Fitzpatrick). In the last ten years, communist countries are tending towards legislation which increases privatization, causing a gradual governmental shift towards the capitalist model (Moscoso Boedo).\nFree people and free markets are the driving force behind the success of the capitalist model. No other economic model inherently bestows limitless opportunity and power to each individual. The temptation of success and power drives the economy forever forward, creating exponential growth, unprecedented among any other economic systems attempted to date.\nWorks Cited\n“Corruption Perceptions Index 2013.” Transparency International, 2013, www.transpa\nDoc 5(Title: \"What Is Capitalism? - The Balance\") of information, making sure it is distributed equitably. Part of protecting the market is keeping order with national defense. The government should also maintain infrastructure, and it taxes capital gains and income to pay for these goals. Global governmental bodies adjudicate international trade. The Balance / Evan Polenghi Advantages of Capitalism Capitalism results in the best products for the best prices because consumers will pay more for what they want the most. Businesses provide what customers want at the highest prices they’ll pay, but prices are limited by competition among businesses, which make their products as efficiently as possible to maximize profit. Most important for economic growth is capitalism's intrinsic reward for innovation, including new products and more efficient production methods. Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., tried to stay ahead of consumer demands, once stating, \"You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new.\" Note The people who benefit most from capitalism tend to be those who already hold wealth and economic power. Disadvantages of Capitalism Capitalism doesn't provide for those who lack competitive skills, including the elderly, children, the developmentally disabled, and caretakers. To keep society functioning, capitalism requires government policies that value the family unit. Despite the idea of a level playing field, capitalism does not promote equality of opportunity. Those without good nutrition, support, and education may never even make it to the playing field, and society will never benefit from their valuable skills. People who are able to find work may face low wages, limited possibilities for advancement, and potentially unsafe working conditions. In the short term, this inequality may seem to be in the best interest of capitalism's winners. They have fewer competitive threats and may use their power to rig the system by creating barriers to entry. For example, they may donate to elected officials who support laws that benefit their industries. They could send their children to private schools while supporting lower taxes and less funding for public schools. Note Inequality limits diversity and the innovation it creates. For example, a diverse business team is more able to identify market niches, understand the various needs of a diverse population, and target products to meet those needs. Capitalism also ignores external costs, such as pollution and climate change, in its pursuit of increasing levels of consumption and growth. The system makes goods cheaper and more accessible in the short run, but over time, it depletes natural resources, lowers the quality of life in the affected areas, and increases costs for everyone. Capitalism and Democracy Monetarist economist Milton Friedman suggested that democracy can exist only in a capitalistic society. However, many countries have socialist economic components and democratically elected governments. Other countries, such as China and Vietnam, are communist but have thriving economies thanks to capitalistic elements. Still others are capitalist and governed by monarchs, oligarchs, or despots. The Preamble of the Constitution sets forth a goal to \"promote the general welfare.\" It requires the government to take a more significant role than that prescribed by a pure market economy. That's why the U.S. has many social safety programs, such as Social Security, food stamps, and Medicare. However, capitalism may also compromise democracy. For example, the Supreme Court case Citizens United v. FEC (2010) gave corporations the same rights as people in terms of their ability to contribute unlimited funds to election campaigns. The controversial decision has increased the influence that wealthy people and companies are able to have on the outcomes of federal, state, and local elections, reinforcing the effects of structural inequality\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the gathered information, it is clear that a capitalist economic system has several key features: it is based on private ownership, operates through a free market, and relies on competition and profit motives.

This leads to technological advancements and economic growth.\n2. **Provides Unlimited Opportunity**: In a capitalist system, individuals can theoretically achieve success regardless of their social background, provided they work hard and make wise choices.\n3. **Efficiency**: Prices and resource allocation are determined by supply and demand, which helps ensure that goods and services are produced where they are most needed.\n\nHowever, capitalism also has significant drawbacks:\n\n1. **Inequality**: Capitalism tends to exacerbate wealth and income disparities, as those with more resources have more opportunities to accumulate more.\n2. **Environmental Issues**: The focus on profit can sometimes lead to environmental damage if regulations are not stringent enough.\n3. **Monopolies**: Large corporations can dominate markets, limiting competition and stifling innovation.\n\nGiven these points, while capitalism has many strengths, it is not without its flaws. Whether it is the best economic system ultimately depends on how well these weaknesses are managed. Different societies might prefer different economic systems based on their values and priorities. </think>\n\n<answer> Whether the capitalistic system of producing goods and services is the best economic system depends on the perspective and the specific context. It excels in fostering innovation, providing opportunities, and promoting efficiency, but it also faces challenges such as inequality, environmental degradation, and monopolistic practices. </answer>",

The shift towards real-time analysis and predictive analytics is also notable. However, I should verify the current trends and impacts.\n</think>\n<search> how is data analysis changing in the world </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"3 Major Ways Data Science is Changing the World Today\") Before we begin our deep dive into how data science is changing the world, review data science applications and get acquainted with data-centric industries, let’s make sure we are firm on what data science actually is. First things first, data science is not a standalone industry but involves an overlap of three other disciplines – math and statistics, computer science and business knowledge.\nData science works in several steps that initiate by extracting required data, continues with data analysis and data processing, and finalizes with drawing insights from our data. The purpose of data science is to find different type patterns within blocks of information we just fed to it. And its magical skill dexterity has helped and is still helping us change the world in three gorgeously profound ways, let’s look into them 😉\nWe can predict the future (seriously)\nDid you know that the first one to predict coronavirus pandemic was actually a computer, not a person? We wrote a great piece about it in our Using AI and Data Science to Fight the Coronavirus Outbreak article, which explains how artificial intelligence from a Canadian surveillance app alarmed its users on the upcoming danger 10 full days before WHO did.\nNo wonder one of the greatest data science applications is future prediction. With machine learning’s great talent in recognizing data patterns, we are now able to forecast threatening health conditions, malfunctioning hardware pieces, infectious livestock diseases, gas leaks, data breaches, collision threats, fire hazards, etc.\nForecasting any performance failures in the transportation and manufacturing lines does not only conserve the company’s money and streamlines supply chain processes, but quite literally saves human lives.\nOne government official has also told us how data science and statistical techniques are currently helping to prevent possible terroristic attack happenings. By analyzing the tone, the wording and the overall message teenagers share in their social media pages, these agencies were able to prevent several massacres that otherwise would have gone undetected. Speaking of security, we’re moving to the next major advancement brought to us by data science.\nWe are getting much safer (luckily)\nSince we’ve managed to turn the first spark into a bonfire to scare those predators away, security has always been a primary concern to all humankind. So it’s no surprise one of the most powerful data tools we have today is being used ubiquitously by National Security Agency, law enforcement, government headquarters, immigration offices, police departments and other institutions aimed to keep all of us safe.\nThe picture painted in the “6 Underground” with Ryan Reynolds is quite literal, so if you’re planning to commit any crime without getting noticed you’ll need to execute an informational suicide or otherwise your logins, your transactions, your likes and your call records will easily give you away.\nWith smart scans, cameras, sensors and cloud storages keeping information up to forever, each of your movements is closely tracked, which, if we put aside a conversation about privacy, is great for our security.\nOne of the great examples of how data science is keeping us safe is adopted by banks and is proven to be highly efficient. If there is an occurrence outside a credit card user’s typical monetary sum, geographic location, IP address, purchases or simply a different withdrawal frequency, the said transaction is denied, the card is instantly blocked with the user receiving a new one. But getting ourselves smarter, richer and safer isn’t the only thing we get from using our data science and our statistical techniques, because as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart.

There are the obvious, banner headlines, of course: AI is everywhere and will change everything; Enterprises continue to move their infrastructure – and data – to the Cloud; GDPR will make data protection every company’s priority. But you knew all that. And maybe you were a bit skeptical of the grandiose claims anyway.\nWhat substantive changes are really taking place? What do you need to be aware of as you set your architectural and procurement strategy and make decisions in those areas? We set out to identify seven impactful changes taking place in the analytics arena, right now, and we present them to you now.\n- Hadoop is Fundamental\nYes, those Big Data project failure rates have been high. Yes, Spark has in some ways displaced Hadoop and increasing numbers of customers are running the former independently of that latter. So the industry blames Hadoop…and stops uttering its name. Hadoop must be dead, right?\nWrong! Everyone’s talking about Data Lakes now and, much of the time, that’s just code for Hadoop. And while, yes, many organizations are implementing their data lakes in cloud storage layers, they’re often using Hadoop ecosystem technologies to analyze that data. Beyond that, consider that cloud storage layers can be made to emulate HDFS, Hadoop’s file system, and you start to realize that when you ponder cloud Data Lakes and Hadoop Data Lakes, there’s a distinction without much difference.\nThe good news is that this year, Hadoop’s going to do what it always should have: see adoption by the Enterprise, without great fanfare. Hadoop will become one data tool among many, and will be used when it makes tactical sense. It’s the combination of data technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Warehouses that make the current analytics market so exciting.\n- Bye-Bye, Enterprise Stack BI\nEarlier this year, MicroStrategy, the Enterprise BI pure play, announced its concession to the companies that compete with it on the front-end, by introducing connectors to their products. MicroStrategy is doubling down on its belief that their back-end OLAP platform, and associated data governance capabilities, are where it can best monetize. The company also seems to have decided that competing on the visualization and dashboard side is difficult and, even to the extent that it can be successful, provides diminishing returns.\nWill the back-end be enough to sustain Enterprise revenue and supported growth? We’ll have to see. But one thing’s for sure: The monolithic Enterprise BI stack has become disaggregated and old dogs will need to learn new tricks.\n- Data Hierarchies\nMaybe you’re familiar with the concept of data hierarchy, in terms of data storage and its correlation with frequency of access. “Hot” data – that which is used most often – is sometimes routed to very fast storage like solid state drives, or even CPU memory cache. Colder data is often routed to older – but cheaper – spinning hard disk drives.\nWith the storage hierarchy well-established, we’ll start to see recognition for other hierarchies this year. For example, analytics involves work with everything from experimental data sets that may be relevant to particular teams or business units, to highly structured, vetted and consensus-driven data that is useful to the entire Enterprise. In the middle are structured data sets that – possibly due to size, or level of cleanliness – are seen as somewhat less than production-level.\nExperimental data sets sit best in a Data Lake. Highly vetted data sets are most logically kept in a data warehouse. And the mid-level data sets will likely live in Hadoop or Cloud storage, but will often be queried from relational databases, using SQL-on-Hadoop bridges like IBM Big SQL, Microsoft PolyBase, and Oracle Big Data SQL.\nAnother hierarchy might stratify data according to whether it will\nDoc 3(Title: \"Marketing the Future: How Data Analytics Is Changing - Knowledge@Wharton\") Data analytics helps marketers learn about their customers with target precision, from the movies they watch on Netflix to their favorite scoop of chocolate ice cream.\nData is ubiquitous, essential, and beneficial — except when it’s not.\nExperts warn that data analytics is at an inflection point. Growing concerns about security risks, privacy, bias, and regulation are bumping up against all the benefits offered by machine learning and artificial intelligence. Layer those concerns on top of worries about the coronavirus pandemic and how it has rapidly changed consumer behavior, and the challenges become clear.\n“What we’re seeing is a lot of chaos in terms of what is the right answer. And what we’re seeing is a change in strategy,” said Neil Hoyne, chief measurement strategist at Google and a senior fellow at Wharton Customer Analytics.\nHoyne said he’s in constant conversation with companies that are trying to figure out the future of data analysis. Google and other internet providers recently announced plans to phase out third-party cookies, which will strip marketers of a wealth of fine-grained information collected by tracking consumers across the web. Proactive companies are already pivoting, so they can be ready for a post-cookie, post-pandemic world.\n“The companies that are going to win are the ones who are using data, not guessing,” said Hoyne, who spoke along with other industry and academic experts during a Nov. 17 virtual symposium, “The Use of Analytics and AI in a Post-pandemic World.” The event was hosted by the nonprofit Marketing Science Institute, along with Wharton Customer Analytics and AI for Business at the Wharton School.\n“The companies that are going to win are the ones who are using data, not guessing.” –Neil Hoyne\nThe symposium touched on a wide range of topics under the umbrella of data analytics while keeping sharp focus on what’s ahead in the evolving world of artificial intelligence.\n“In trying to design the program today, we couldn’t ignore the obvious, which is 2020 has been the year of disruption and risks — and, hopefully, successful management of those risks,” said AI for Business Faculty Director Kartik Hosanagar, who is also a Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions.\nThe Risks and Rewards of Data\nMuch attention has been paid to all the impressive ways that AI and machine learning help companies by automating services, predicting patterns, and making recommendations that lead to greater sales and engagement. More than a third of Amazon’s sales come from its recommendation algorithm, for example, while YouTube’s algorithm drives 70% of the content watched on its platform.\nBut, Hosanagar said, the risks associated with AI need equal attention and priority from managers.\nAI can create social, reputational, and regulatory risks, even for companies well-versed in technology. Amazon scrapped a recruiting software with a gender bias; Twitter shut down a Microsoft chatbot that “learned” how to post racists tweets; and Facebook was sued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which alleged the platform’s targeted advertising violates the Fair Housing Act by restricting who views housing ads.\n“These are not small risks for the companies,” said Hosanagar, who strongly recommended business leaders create interdisciplinary teams to continuously monitor and evaluate data for bias.\nBias can be unwittingly baked into algorithms by the humans who create them. Symposium speaker Kalinda Ukanwa, a marketing professor at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business, offered a powerful example to illustrate the problem. “Rebecca” applies for a loan with an online bank that uses AI to determine the loan. She is rejected, despite having good credit. But if she enters the same information with one difference — her gender — she is approved.\nWhile the online bank may see an initial surge in business because of the ease of use, it may suffer long-term reputational\nDoc 4(Title: \"3 Major Ways Data Science is Changing the World Today\") e as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart. A part where he says his mega-neutrino bomb was secretly a saving vaccine “against humanity as the planet’s worst virus’. As in we humans suck and everything we touch turns to dust. But as it turned out, in the real world we humans are actually the good guys.\nNot only we collectively treat our planet better each year, but we also use our best minds, resources and efforts to protect it. Three industry leaders – Environmental Defense Fund, California Air Resources Board and Plant Labs – are currently working on the conjoint reporting platform, that by launching two satellites into space aims to track the present situation and any occurring climate change squarely.\nLikewise, governments and city officials are using data patterns to allocate resources more wisely in regards to traffic routes, street lights, water supply and other utilities. The ubiquitous rise of smart homes, solar power, and multilateral recycling helps developed countries to decrease energy consumption and increase their efficiency.\nThere’s even a yearly “Data Science for Social Good” event hosted by the same-name fellowship, where data scientists from all over the world get together to help mother nature and “tackle the problems that really matter”.\nConclusion\nIt turns out data matters are inextricably linked to our modern-day progress and the whole purpose of data science is to propel that progress deeper and further. Feeling in the mood for more playful insights?\nCheck out our other data science-related articles:\nDoc 5(Title: \"Data Science is Changing the World for the Better: Here’s How ...\") scientists collaborate to ‘tackle the problems that really matter’.\nIn the past its projects have seen analytics used to improve outcomes for rough sleepers in the UK, increase the efficiency of reviews in biomedical research, and identify the students most likely to struggle in an academic environment.\nSimilarly, data scientists with a competitive streak may already be aware of the competitions hosted on Kaggle – some of which also focus on social problems, like identifying households with the greatest need for welfare assistance.\nAs technology continues to progress, the influence data science has on the world around us will grow, and in some circumstances it represents our best chance of solving some of the planet’s biggest and most pressing issues.\nAbout the Author\nPrasad Kothari is an analytics and data science leader who has worked extensively building high-performing teams for various organizations and has provided consulting to many fortune 500 clients.

It was reviewed by the author in 2025.\nWith the 150th anniversary of Confederation upon us, it is perhaps appropriate to reflect on the high points of 150 years of legal change in Canada. Such an exercise is always a challenge, of course, because what might be considered significant to some may be seen as minor or less important to others.\nIn this brief review, I will focus first upon “the grand scale”: those developments and changes which seem to me to have had the most impact on our national and social evolution over the last 150 years, and then discuss specific areas which likely have the most impact on the daily lives of Canadians.\nIndependence from Britain\nCanada in 1867 was focused mainly in the centre (what became the provinces of Ontario and Quebec); was predominantly white and was mainly of British extraction and English-speaking. While we think of 1867 as the year we became a new country, many of the powers we now take for granted as a completely sovereign state were still reserved for Britain to exercise on our behalf. Legally, the highest judicial authority in the United Kingdom – in the form of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council – was also the highest court of appeal for Canada. The legislation which is considered to be our founding document was an Act of the British Parliament – the British North America Act (now, The Constitution Act, 1867) – and it described the division of powers between the national Parliament and the provincial legislatures. It also set out some basic rules about how we would be governed but many other basic principles remained unwritten and were encompassed by the broad, general statement that our constitution was to be “similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.”\nCanada on its 150th birthday is a hugely different place. Constitutionally, we have moved from the status of being “almost still a colony” of Great Britain, to being a completely independent and sovereign entity. While this evolution has, of course, also included major events in other areas (politics, military, and so on), the most important legal steps have been in the form of both statutory and common (“judge-made”) law. One of the most significant took place in 1931, with the passage of the Statute of Westminster. Until 1931, the British Parliament had retained ultimate authority in most areas of jurisdiction, reserving to the government in London the authority to override or nullify laws passed in Canada (and the other Commonwealth Dominions) as it saw fit. The Statute of Westminster removed most of this authority from Great Britain and passed it to the legislative bodies in each country, including Canada. The exception for Canada was in relation to the power to amend our Constitution: by agreement among the provinces and Ottawa, the United Kingdom Parliament continued to retain this authority.\nWhen it came to legal rulings and decisions, however, the Judicial Committee continued to be our final court of appeal until 1949. That year, Parliament (in Ottawa) amended The Supreme Court Act to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee in London, making the Supreme Court of Canada our ultimate judicial decision-maker.\nThe final, and perhaps most important, milestone in our constitutional development as an independent country occurred in the early 1980s with the so-called “repatriation” (or transfer) of our final constitutional authority from the United Kingdom to Canada. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau led the way towards a truly “made in Canada” Constitution which included, for the first time, a written list of our most basic rights and freedoms, as well as a method for changing the Constitution itself. The Constitution Act, 1982 was signed into\nDoc 2(Title: \"Reasons Why Laws Change - Year 12 Legal Studies\") anging values within the community for example the legalisation of abortion and the banning of smoking in pubs/clubs and in cars with minors.\nChanging community awareness:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community awareness. As a national community, we are much more informed today and aware of relevant issues largely due to the speed and efficiency of communication. As informed citizens, we put pressure on law makers to amend or introduce legislation in areas that we believe need to change. For example, Brodie's law was introduced in 2011 after a teenager ended her life due to bullying at a café where she worked. This law now makes it a serious crime (punishable by up to 10 years) to bully others in the workplace and holds spreads the responsibility of ending bullying.\nChanging Expectations of the Legal System:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to the change expectations towards our legal system. Years ago, laws were expected to regulate behaviour however people now expect the law to uphold individual rights as well as protect people from harm. As such, the law has needed to take a more active role to ensure that it remains relevant. Examples of these include online defamation, duty of care and negligence.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Reasons Why Laws Change - Year 12 Legal Studies\") Technology:\nOne reason why laws may need to change is due to the progessive nature of technology. As technology is continually developed, with that comes features which may be used in a harmful manner to society. As technology's capability is being grows, the law should be changed and adapted to remain relevant and purposeful. An example of this is the Summary Offences Amendment (2007) as a result of mobile phones equiped with cameras being used as an 'upskirting' device alongside 'online piracy' laws. This legislation was changed to make this actions illegal and protect victims.\nChanging community values:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community values. Values across society changes over time. What people in society may consider important and relevant within one generation may alter over a transitional period of time. In order to remain relevant, the law must uphold and reflect the values and beliefs of society in the present time. For example, people's perspective revolving around issues such as Abortion (2004) have changed over time as well as the detrimental health impacts of smoking and passive smoking. As such, laws have been amended or introduced to reflect the changing values within the community for example the legalisation of abortion and the banning of smoking in pubs/clubs and in cars with minors.\nChanging community awareness:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community awareness.

In railroads, mines, farms, mills, lumber yards, sweatshops, and construction sites, the common worker performed demanding and difficult labor in conditions that were often dangerous, unsanitary, unhealthy, exploitative, or otherwise harmful.\nUnions enjoyed no real legal protection and workers organized for better pay and conditions largely at their own risk. Virtually all of the legal and political structure was organized for the benefit of the corporations that controlled the lives of the workers they employed. When soldiers or police officers used violence to break up strikes, the violence was almost always perpetrated against striking laborers at the direction of company bosses. Those bosses often enjoyed cozy relationships with politicians who steered policies and crafted legislation to maintain the status quo.\nAll that, however, was about to change. The last century has witnessed an unprecedented change in the American workplace. Starting in the 1920s, major laws were passed that guaranteed protections, redistributed power, and regulated everything from wages to hours to union management to hiring practices. Racial minorities saw new laws reverse decades of discriminatory hiring practices, as did women, immigrants, older Americans, and other vulnerable groups. Laws were enacted to improve workplace safety, to prevent child labor, and to bolster unions while preventing union bosses from exploiting their own members.\nModern workers owe their comparatively cushy conditions to the efforts of the activists and organizers who appealed for fair pay and reasonable protections at the risk of being fired, jailed, beaten, or killed. Here's a look at a century of labor laws that lifted the average American worker out of a condition of poverty and subjugation and into one that offered a much greater degree of self-determination and profit sharing.\nYou may also like: How your state gets to work\nRailway Labor Act\nIn 1926, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Railway Labor Act after decades of high-profile labor strikes, many of which were violent and even deadly. The act compelled union workers and companies in the railroad industry—which witnessed some of the most significant labor unrest—to negotiate through arbitration, bargaining, and mediation before resorting to strikes. As the first federal law that guaranteed workers the right to organize and choose their own union leaders without company interference, the act was one of the most significant reforms in history up to that point.\nDavis-Bacon Act\nThe 1931 Davis-Bacon Act required all private companies that won contracts on any significant public-works construction projects to pay workers the so-called \"prevailing wage,\" which generally corresponded with union wages. The law was necessary because the country was in the throes of the Great Depression, millions were out of work, and labor bosses frequently exploited the desperation of the unemployed by offering take-it-or-leave-it wage ultimatums. The standard remains in place today and still covers roughly 25% of construction workers at any given time.\nNorris-LaGuardia Act\nThe Norris-LaGuardia Act, enacted in 1932, was a major victory for workers seeking to organize for better pay and conditions. The law protected peaceful union strikes and protests from federal court injunctions, which had long hindered union organization efforts. It also prevented companies from firing workers for joining a union and outlawed so-called yellow-dog contracts, which required prospective employees to sign a promise not to join a union.\nNational Labor Relations Act\nThe 1935 National Labor Relations Act is among the most important legislation in labor history and remains\nDoc 5(Title: \"The Evolution of Canadian Law - LawNow\") cation for the limitation of rights in a democracy like ours, would the violation of rights be allowed. Otherwise, the courts were given the task of fashioning an appropriate remedy for persons whose rights or freedoms had been infringed or breached.\nThe changes in Canadian laws and society flowing from the enactment of the Charter in 1982 touch virtually all aspects of our modern lives. Things which we take for granted in 2017 which resulted from enshrining our fundamental rights and freedoms include:\n- Sunday shopping (a result of our freedom of religion);\n- protection from improper and arbitrary government prying into our private affairs and the requirement for a search warrant before state officials can snoop around our private property (all parts of our rights to be protected from unreasonable search or seizure);\n- our right to speak with a lawyer if we are arrested or detained; to know all aspects of the case against us if we are charged with an offence, and to be treated fairly in the court system (all parts of our rights to fair trials);\n- the legalization of abortion (the rights of women to decide for themselves what will be done with their bodies); and\n- protection of the media from harassment or persecution for investigating and exposing government and political wrong-doing (part of the freedom of the press).\nMore recent Charter developments touching the most basic aspects of life in Canada include the legalization of gay marriage; the introduction of physician-assisted death; and innovations such as supervised injection sites.\nTo move from these general areas of how we govern ourselves, to more particular areas of law which touch our daily lives, reveals just as many examples of monumental change from 1867 to where we are today.\nCriminal Law\nIn the field of criminal law, for example, in 1867 most of our legal provisions were taken from the rulings of English judges, and the British Parliament. In 1892, however, Parliament enacted the first Canadian Criminal Code, which continues to be the main source of our criminal law today. Over the years since 1892, the Code has been amended often, in order to address new situations not foreseen in earlier years (it now includes computer offences, for example). Other amendments have included the abolition of all forms of physical punishment (flogging and hard labour, for example), and, in 1976, the death penalty.\nFamily Law\nFamily law, and divorce in particular, have also changed immensely since 1867. Until 1968 divorce was mainly governed by provincial laws which differed across the country. Many could only be divorced by an Act of Parliament: Someone wanting out of an abusive or otherwise bad marriage had to seek the assistance and support of their Member of Parliament who would introduce a Private Members Bill in the House of Commons declaring the marriage ended and the parties divorced. However, with the passage of the Divorce Act in 1968, the rules and procedures across the country were standardized, and all such matters were placed into the hands of the courts. Divorce became far more available and further change followed in 1986, when the Divorce Act was amended to simplify the situation even further through “no fault” divorces.\nAnother significant development over the last 150 years is the evolution of legal protections for spousal partners when it comes to the division of family assets. In 1867, after a divorce the ex-wife, and any children she might attempt to have living with her, were often left penniless. In the last 150 years, however, various support laws have been enacted so that now both former partners must share the obligations of child support and neither party is able to benefit unfairly from the marriage and its termination. In addition, property acquired during the marriage is to be divided equally between the former spouses, unless one side or the other can prove in court a significantly greater contribution.\nAnother major change in the area of family la\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, here are some key ways law has changed over time:\n\n1. **Constitutional Changes**: From being a British colony to gaining full independence and sovereignty, and the adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, which enshrined fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\n2. **Technology and Its Impact**: Laws have evolved to address the use of technology, such as laws related to online defamation, privacy, and the misuse of technology like 'upskirting'.\n\n3. **Social and Cultural Changes**: Laws have been amended or introduced to reflect changing social and cultural values, such as the legalization of abortion, gay marriage, and the protection of LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n4. **Worker Protections**: Significant labor laws have been enacted to protect workers, such as the Railway Labor Act, Davis-Bacon Act, Norris-LaGuardia Act, and the National Labor Relations Act, ensuring better working conditions, fair wages, and union rights.\n\n5. **Criminal Justice**: Criminal laws have been updated to address new offenses, such as computer crimes, and to eliminate outdated punishments like the death penalty and physical corporal punishment.\n\n6. **Family Law**: Family laws have undergone substantial changes, particularly regarding divorce, which became more accessible and less dependent on parliamentary intervention.

These often include legal but complex financial maneuvers, tax havens, and exploiting loopholes in international tax laws.</think>\n\n<search> common tax avoidance strategies for large companies </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax\") It is not unusual for large U.S. corporations to pay no U.S. income taxes despite making billions of dollars in profits. In fact, one study of corporate securities filings found 55 of America's largest companies paid no income taxes in 2020 despite generating hefty profits, while netting $3.5 billion in aggregate tax rebates. Nearly half of those companies paid no U.S. income taxes for three successive years.\nAmong those not paying income taxes for at least three years were profitable blue chips Nike, Inc. (NKE), FedEx Corp. (FDX), and Salesforce, Inc. (CRM).\nHow do profitable corporations get away with paying no U.S. income tax? Their most lucrative (and perfectly legal) tax avoidance strategies include accelerated depreciation, the offshoring of profits, generous deductions for appreciated employee stock options, and tax credits.\nKey Takeaways\n- Large companies use a maze of tax breaks and deductions to minimize and often eliminate their corporate income tax liabilities.\n- Recent efforts to limit profit shifting to lower-tax countries have not been cost-effective.\n- Accelerated depreciation, tax credits, and the expensing rules for employee stock options are other ways large companies cut their tax bills.\n- The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a new alternative corporate minimum tax, while doling out $369 billion in additional tax credits over a decade.\nCorporate Tax Rate and Receipts in the U.S.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 set a flat 21% U.S. corporate income tax rate, replacing the 35% top marginal rate in effect previously.\nProponents of lower corporate taxes had long complained about the 35% U.S. rate as one the highest among advanced economies. Starting in 2018, the TCJA reduced the combined federal and state U.S. corporate income tax burden to the middle of the pack in rankings by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) based on the effective tax rate.\nBy other measures, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered a much more generous windfall for U.S. corporations. Corporate income tax receipts fell from 1.9% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 to 1% of GDP in 2020. The OECD average stood at nearly 3%.\nIn 2018, U.S. corporations paid a 7.8% average cash effective tax rate on their U.S. income, versus 18% for the income they earned on the territory of the 10 largest U.S. trading partners.\nThe Real Tax Rate vs. the Official Rate\nThe difference between the 21% statutory corporate income tax rate and the effective rate based on the cash taxes companies actually pay is the result of generous tax breaks doled out by U.S. Congress.\nThe 379 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 11.3% on their 2018 income.\nOne of the rationales for lowering the corporate income tax rate in the debate over the TCJA was that the cut would be offset by the elimination of tax breaks and loopholes for large companies. While the new law dropped some tax subsidies, it introduced many new ones.\nImportant\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a 15% minimum income tax on corporations earning at least $1 billion annually. The 2017 TCJA eliminated the prior version of the corporate alternative minimum tax.\nCorporate Tax Loopholes in the U.S.\nClearly, corporations have become extremely savvy at finding ways to pay less in taxes. For example, when Congress passed the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, payments to families under the legislation stole the headlines. The restoration of the carryback provision for corporations' net operating losses (NOLs) not just for 2020 but also for 2018 and 2019, on even more generous terms than those that prevailed before elimination in the TCJA, received considerably less notice.\nListed below are several key corporate tax-avoidance strategies. The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing the CEOs of the largest corporations, notes many of the tax breaks that can leave some companies owing no f\nDoc 2(Title: \"How Big Companies Avoid Big Tax Bills | Duke's Fuqua School of Business\") Scott Dyreng | How Big Companies Avoid Big Tax Bills\nHow Big Companies Avoid Big Tax Bills\nProf. Scott Dyreng explains common tax-cutting tactics and how lawmakers hope to stop them\nThe Biden administration has proposed changes to corporate tax laws to fund improvements to infrastructure across the U.S., such as roads and bridges.\nSome proposed changes are designed specifically to generate more tax revenue from the nation’s largest companies, such as Amazon, Nike, Netflix, HP and FedEx – all examples lawmakers have highlighted as firms that pay relatively modest tax bills despite annual profits in the billions of dollars according to public financial statements.\nAccounting professor Scott Dyreng of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business conducts research on several strategies big corporations use to keep their tax bills low. He explains some of those tactics in this Fuqua Q&A.\nDo these companies really pay no income taxes?\nWe cannot truly know the answer to that question because tax returns are private. So when people say, for example, ‘Amazon paid no taxes,’ they are likely referencing tax cost estimates included in a company’s disclosed financial accounting statements, such as annual 10K filings with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).\nAmazon is an example that comes up repeatedly, so I took time to review financial statements from 2012 to 2018, which show Amazon reported $25.4 billion in domestic pretax profits and paid about $2 billion in federal taxes. That’s an 8-percent rate. Although this is a rough calculation, and quite low relative to the official corporate tax rate of 21 percent, it is not negative or zero.\nWhy do people believe these large companies aren’t paying?\nPeople often look at the pre-tax profits of a company in their SEC filings and compare those figures to the company’s “current provision” for U.S. income taxes.\nEvery year, many companies report large profits and very low or even negative taxes. For example, Salesforce reported about $2.5 billion in pre-tax U.S. profits in 2021, but reported a current federal tax expense of negative $12 million.\nHow do these companies end up with relatively low tax rates?\nThere are lots of ways companies can reduce their tax burdens. For example, some companies generate large deductions from capital investments (e.g. FedEx paid very little tax in 2018 because deductions from capital expenditures offset most of the tax bill). Many companies generate tax credits for investments in research and development or sustainable energy.\nMany companies, including Amazon, Google and Salesforce, also cut their tax bills by using restricted stock units (RSUs) for a portion of employees’ compensation. When granting the RSU to an employee, a company is not allowed to claim a tax deduction until the shares vest. If share prices are rising, the value of the shares at vesting can be much more than the value at grant date, and the tax deduction is therefore larger than the value on the date they were granted.\nSuppose a Salesforce RSU vested four years after it was given to an employee. For example, it was given at a price of $90 in June of 2017, but when it vested in June of 2021, the price was $238 (see Salesforce stock prices here). The employee would have to pay taxes on the $238 just like they had been paid in cash, and Salesforce would receive a deduction for $238, as though they had paid the employee in cash.\nEverything seems fine there, but what’s interesting is the way the amounts are reflected differently in financial accounting versus in tax deductions. Salesforce would record financial accounting expense equal to the price at the date of grant ($90).\nAccounting rules do not require an additional compensation expense if the share price increases. As a result, Salesforce never records the difference of $148 in compensation expense on the financial statements, which makes it look like it has really high financial accounting income.\nThe reason for the tax deduction is t\nDoc 3(Title: \"How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax\") ailed before elimination in the TCJA, received considerably less notice.\nListed below are several key corporate tax-avoidance strategies. The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing the CEOs of the largest corporations, notes many of the tax breaks that can leave some companies owing no federal income tax for some years continue to enjoy strong bipartisan support.\nOffshoring Profits\nThe TCJA moderately reduced but did not eliminate the enormous savings corporations realize by shifting profits from the U.S. to countries with lower tax rates. This can be done by shifting intellectual property to a subsidiary in a tax haven and charging U.S. corporate affiliates more to use it, among other tactics.\nProfit shifting to lower-tax countries reduced taxable income reported in the U.S. by $300 billion annually, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018, and changes under the TCJA were expected to slow the annual profit shifting by $65 billion.\nAt the statutory 21% U.S. tax rate, this $65 billion in reported profits not shifted abroad as a result of the TCJA would produce annual tax receipts of about $13.7 billion. Of course, as already noted, the effective tax rate for U.S. corporations is significantly lower.\nOffsetting such potential savings under the TCJA were the costs of a shift to a system reducing U.S. taxes on the earnings of overseas subsidiaries, while offering a tax break on foreign income derived from intangible assets in the U.S. Those provisions were expected to save U.S. multinationals $422.1 billion in U.S. taxes over a five-year period through 2024.\nThe TCJA did impose two new taxes on the overseas earnings of U.S. multinationals. Those companies' global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), defined as overseas income in excess of a 10% return on tangible assets overseas net of depreciation, is now subject to U.S. taxation at a 10.5% rate, rising to 13.125% in 2026.\nAnother TCJA \"stick\" designed to curb profit shifting, the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), imposes a minimum tax of 10.5% on the sum of a corporation's taxable income and its tax deductible payments to foreign subsidiaries other than for cost of goods sold. BEAT applies only to companies with annual gross receipts averaging more than $500 million over the three prior years that also make more than 3% of their total deductible payments to foreign affiliates.\nU.S. tax receipts from GILTI and BEAT were expected to total $198.2 billion over TCJA's first decade through 2027.\nAdding up the credits and the debits, the TCJA's attempts to curtail profit shifting appear to be costing the U.S. Treasury significantly more than what they save. Meanwhile, the business of tax havens has been largely unaffected. In 2019, corporate profits reported in Bermuda were more than four times the size of the island country's annual GDP.\nAccelerated Depreciation\nWhen companies acquire capital assets like buildings or factory equipment they can then deduct their depreciation cost from profits over a period of years deemed to represent those assets' useful life. Accelerated depreciation allows a company to write off more of the cost faster, providing a larger deduction up front against taxable income.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowed companies to deduct the full cost of such qualifying investments in the year they were made from 2018 through 2022. Bonus depreciation declines to 80% in 2023, 60% for 2024, 40% in 2025, and 20% in 2026 before elimination in 2027.\nThe congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates accelerated depreciation of equipment will save companies more than $130 billion in federal taxes between 2020 and 2023.\nTax Credits\nThe U.S. tax code is riddled with a variety of tax breaks for businesses estimated to cost the Treasury more than $100 billion annually, though that's a small proportion of total U.S. tax expenditures of about $1.6 trillion annually, including associated spending and foregone payroll and excise tax receipts.\nThe\nDoc 4(Title: \"How Big Companies Avoid Big Tax Bills | Duke's Fuqua School of Business\") ot require an additional compensation expense if the share price increases. As a result, Salesforce never records the difference of $148 in compensation expense on the financial statements, which makes it look like it has really high financial accounting income.\nThe reason for the tax deduction is that share-based compensation dilutes the value of existing shareholders the same as if cash had been paid to the employee. To that end, the employee pays taxes just as if he or she had been paid in cash, and the company receives a tax deduction just as if the payment had been cash.\nWhat tax impacts could this have on the employee?\nThe tax burden to the employee is exactly the same as if the employee had been paid cash. And the tax deduction to the company is exactly the same as if the company had paid cash. The difference is that the accounting treatment results in a lower recorded compensation expense on the firm’s financial statements.\nSo, in the end, the company isn’t saving taxes relative to what it would have owed if it paid employees in cash. Instead, the company is reporting artificially high income in its financial reports.\nThis high income is not an accounting trick. The companies are following the rules. There is a long, contentious history about how to account for share-based compensation. Current accounting rules, which resulted from that contentious debate, are not perfect.\nThe accounting results in a situation where, if stock prices are rising quickly (like Salesforce, Amazon, Tesla, and others), the compensation expense recorded on financial statements is likely lower than the economic cost to the company. The opposite occurs, too, but doesn’t make headlines. If stock prices are dropping, the compensation expense will be more than the tax deduction, resulting in extraordinarily high tax rates for the company.\nThis story may not be republished without permission from Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. Please contact media-relations@fuqua.duke.edu for additional information.\nDoc 5(Title: \"How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax\") enues.\nThe law also imposes a new 1% excise tax on corporate share repurchases, which was expected to raise $73.7 billion over a decade.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also increased IRS funding by nearly $80 billion over a decade; the Biden Administration publicly committed not to use the funds to increase auditing of taxpayers earning less than $400,000 annually. Increased tax enforcement for the highest earners and corporations was expected to generate $204 billion in additional tax revenue over a decade.\nThe law provides $369 billion in tax credits over a decade to businesses and individuals for investments in renewable power, clean transportation and energy security.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe U.S. tax code has conflicting aims. Its objective of equitably maximizing federal tax receipts is frequently at odds with a variety of tailored tax breaks pursuing diverse policy goals.\nSo long as efforts to make large corporations pay their fair share must coexist with tax credits and deductions encouraging a wide range of favored activities, corporate lobbyists and tax lawyers will remain in demand.\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, large companies avoid taxes through various strategies:\n\n1. **Offshoring Profits**: By shifting profits to countries with lower tax rates, companies can reduce their overall tax liability.\n2. **Accelerated Depreciation**: Writing off the cost of capital assets faster than their actual useful life reduces taxable income.\n3. **Tax Credits**: Utilizing various tax credits for activities like research and development or sustainable energy investments.\n4. **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**: Using RSUs for employee compensation allows companies to defer tax deductions until the shares vest, often when the share price is higher.\n5. **Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)**: While the TCJA introduced taxes on overseas earnings, companies still find ways to manage their tax liabilities.\n\nThese strategies allow companies to legally minimize their tax obligations, sometimes to the point of appearing to pay no taxes at all. </think>\n\n<answer> Large companies avoid taxes through strategies such as offshoring profits, accelerated depreciation, tax credits, restricted stock units (RSUs), and managing global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). </answer>",

Having spent years as a creative artist myself, I’ve gathered all my best tips and insights into this article.\n14 Top Ways to Earn as an Artist\nIf you’re passionate, skilled, and committed, yet unsure how to earn money as an artist, know that there are many paths open to you—and you don’t have to stick to just one.

In today’s digital world, selling your art directly has become much simpler. Below, I’ve listed some top strategies to get you started.\n- Sell Your Original Works: Whether it’s paintings, sculptures, decorative items, or jewelry, you can sell them online through various websites or e-stores.

This can range from street art to murals, offering another income avenue.\n- Use Crowdfunding: Platforms like Patreon, Kickstarter, and Indiegogo allow you to gather financial support from your fans. Offering various incentives can help attract a wide supporter base.\nTeaching and Consulting\nIf you have experience, you can guide other aspiring artists.

Digital marketing has changed the way companies can build their brands and promote themselves. It’s no longer just about having a logo, slogan or print.

Cost-effective\nDigital marketing can save you money in the long run because it is relatively inexpensive compared to other forms of advertising. For example, buying an ad in a newspaper can cost thousands, while social media ads can generally reap the rewards from spending only €100 per month.\nAnother way in which digital marketing can save you money is by creating more effective campaigns and increased ROI. Every cent spent is trackable with what you receive in return in clicks, website traffic, conversion rates and sales.\n4.

You also have the opportunity to turn those visits into customers with an effective email marketing or social media strategy.\nThe more people that know about your business and brand, the better. Digital marketing can help with this by making it easier for potential customers to find you on search engines such as Google or Bing – even if someone does not type in precisely what you are offering, they might end up finding a related keyword that is close enough and will still lead them to your website.\n5.

The strategies of digital marketing are straightforward to monitor and calculate. Results can be measured by the impact they are having on your business.

    "agent_answer": "After reviewing the information, I still haven't found any direct statements from Piet Mondrian on his views regarding Cubism and De Stijl. Given the limited information available, I will make an educated guess based on his known philosophy and the historical context.\n\nMondrian was a proponent of abstraction and believed that art should reflect the essential elements of reality, which he saw as straight lines and primary colors. De Stijl, the movement he was associated with, emphasized the purity of form and color. While Mondrian was influenced by Cubism, particularly in his early works, he eventually moved away from its complex forms towards a more simplified, geometric style. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Mondrian viewed Cubism as a step towards his ultimate goal of pure abstraction, but also recognized its limitations in achieving this goal.\n\n<answer> Piet Mondrian viewed Cubism as a precursor to his own artistic philosophy, seeing it as a step towards pure abstraction, but also recognizing its limitations in achieving this goal.

Classically trained in the European school, Picasso emerged as a symbolist, drawing on Impressionism through Munch and Post-Impressionism via Lautrec. From Cézanne and Rousseau, he learned about archaic and tribal art, which led him toward Cubism.\nPicasso strove to define his place in the history of painting from the outset of his long career. Art historians consider his late works direct dialogues with Old Masters such as Velazquez, Goya and Rembrandt. He lived most of his life in France, so Picasso knew the latest trends and schools of art. Accordingly, he studied Symbolism, which worked to build a visual language of the soul from imagery drawn from mythology and dreams. Picasso also drew on Impressionist Munch to explore the nature of souls. Clearly Lautrec influenced his palette and his choice of subjects – prostitutes and the poor – during his Blue period, so-called because of his blue and gray palette. In fact, much of Picasso’s early work experiments with color – beginning in 1897 in violet and green through the Blue and consequent Rose period and his orange and red palette. This led him to experiment with shape as well, following Cezanne – Post-Impressionism influenced by primitive art – and Rousseau – experiments in Naïve art. Picasso began to use more angular shapes and figures, as well as more color, as he worked toward founding cubism with Braque, where the artist analyzes a subject or shape, disassembles it, then reassembles it in an abstracted form. Working in cubism led Picasso to invent collage and work toward a second form of Cubism (synthetic) where artists worked in mixed media.\nDoc 2(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") ntense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art. There is no denying the power of Picasso’s creative mind, and the effects of his stylistic experimentation in Cubism shaped the artistic movements that followed him. As an artist who would come to influence so many artists himself, Picasso is a pillar in the modern art world with a fascinating life full of inspiration.\nFrom https://news.masterworksfineart.com/2019/11/28/what-was-picassos-inspiration .\n* As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\nDoc 3(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") Pablo Picasso*, born in 1881 in Malaga, Spain, and died in 1973 in Mougins, France, was an active artist for most of his long life. His father was an artist himself, was Picasso’s first and most formative art teacher. Picasso has one of the most prolific creative careers in history, and his work was not only loved by art lovers around the world, but it was also incredibly influential for artists everywhere. But what was Picasso’s inspiration? What inspired these famous works?\nPicasso went through many creative phases in his career. These phases have been labeled as “periods” and show the different styles and mediums he was experimenting with during that time in his life. Picasso's “Blue Period” started in 1901 and lasted until 1904. During this period, Picasso painted mostly in cool blue and green tones, sometimes using a warmer color to accent his works. These pieces have a melancholy about them, and are quite somber, featuring scenes of poverty and desolation. What was Picasso’s inspiration to start painting in this way? In the spring of 1901, one of Picasso’s dear friends, a painter and poet named Carlos Casagemas, committed suicide in a cafe in Paris. Picasso was deeply affected by his death, and sank into a depression that lasted several years. Picasso’s journey through his grief and depression is clearly reflected in his “Blue Period.”\nIn 1904, Picasso moved to Montmartre in Paris, and settled into the community of bohemian artists and creators there. Coming out of his depression over his friend’s death, Picasso moved on from dark and serious subjects in his paintings to more lighthearted compositions featuring harlequins, clowns and carnival performers. His color palette warmed up as well, with his paintings now bathed in reds, oranges, pinks and earth tones. This period would be known as Picasso's “Rose Period” and it lasted until 1906. So what can be credited with this major shift in his work? Picasso met a woman named Fernande Olivier in 1904 and they began a relationship that lasted seven years. Olivier would be the first of a long line of women who were muses and lovers to Picasso over the years. This relationship and the end of his bout of depression signaled a more positive phase of Picasso’s life. The overall tone of his work during this period is much more carefree and less somber.\nCiting beautiful women as inspiration would become a theme in Picasso’s life, all the way up until his death. Picasso has been quoted saying: “For me there are only two kinds of women, goddesses and doormats.” He often became obsessed with a young woman and she became an artistic muse for him, inspiring many works. All of the women Picasso took as either wives or lovers were painted by the artist. His second wife Jacqueline Roque was the subject of over 400 portraits by Picasso, and was a great source of inspiration to him.\nFrom 1906-1909 Picasso was heavily inspired by African art, after he was exposed to traditional African masks and other art objects coming from Africa into French museums in Paris. This phase has been called his “African Period,” and was a precursor to his most famous period, “Cubism.” Influenced by Paul Cezanne’s experimentation with three-dimensional spacing and perspective, Picasso and Georges Braque pioneered the artistic movement known as Cubism. This way of breaking down a form to its most basic forms and reconstructing them in an abstracted way is what Picasso is most known for.\nSo what can we say was Picasso's inspiration?\nThroughout his life, Picasso's inspiration came in many different forms. Whether it be working through his emotions, responding to a difficult life event, meeting a beautiful young woman, an intense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art.

Concrete operational children can understand the concept of conservation which means that changing one quality (in this example, height or water level) can be compensated for by changes in another quality (width). Consequently, there is the same amount of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.\nDecentration: Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any object (such as the height of the glass) and instead consider the changes in other dimensions too (such as the width of the glass). This allows for conservation to occur.\nSeriation: Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a methodical way is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can methodically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length, while younger children approach a similar task in a haphazard way.\nThese new cognitive skills increase the child’s understanding of the physical world, however according to Piaget, they still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think in systematic scientific ways. For example, when asked which variables influence the period that a pendulum takes to complete its arc and given weights they can attach to strings in order to do experiments, most children younger than 12 perform biased experiments from which no conclusions can be drawn (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).\nInformation Processing\nChildren differ in their memory abilities, and these differences predict both their readiness for school and academic performance in school (PreBler, Krajewski, & Hasselhorn, 2013). During middle and late childhood children make strides in several areas of cognitive function including the capacity of working memory, their ability to pay attention, and their use of memory strategies. Both changes in the brain and experience foster these abilities.\nWorking Memory: The capacity of working memory expands during middle and late childhood, and research has suggested that both an increase in processing speed and the ability to inhibit irrelevant information from entering memory are contributing to the greater efficiency of working memory during this age (de Ribaupierre, 2002). Changes in myelination and synaptic pruning in the cortex are likely behind the increase in processing speed and ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli (Kail, McBride-Chang, Ferrer, Cho, & Shu, 2013).\nChildren with learning disabilities in math and reading often have difficulties with working memory (Alloway, 2009). They may struggle with following the directions of an assignment. When a task calls for multiple steps, children with poor working memory may miss steps because they may lose track of where they are in the task. Adults working with such children may need to communicate: Using more familiar vocabulary, using shorter sentences, repeating task instructions more frequently, and breaking more complex tasks into smaller more manageable steps. Some studies have also shown that more intensive training of working memory strategies, such as chunking, aid in improving the capacity of working memory in children with poor working memory (Alloway, Bibile, & Lau, 2013).\nAttention: As noted above, the ability to inhibit irrelevant information improves during this age group, with there being a sharp improvement in selective attention from age six into adolescence (Vakil, Blachstein, Sheinman, & Greenstein, 2009). Children also improve in their ability to shift their attention between tasks or different features of a task (Carlson, Zelazo, & Faja, 2013). A younger child who is asked to sort objects into piles based on type of object, car versus animal, or color of object, red versus blue, may have difficulty if you switch from asking them to sort based on type to now having\nDoc 5(Title: \"Historical and Legal Approach to the Study of Public Administration\") rative part concerns itself with the functioning of the public organizations.\nThe legal approach throws light on the legal framework in which the public administration operates but excludes other important and informal aspects like sociological and psychological dynamics at play and therefore is considered an incomplete approach by many scholars.

Classically trained in the European school, Picasso emerged as a symbolist, drawing on Impressionism through Munch and Post-Impressionism via Lautrec. From Cézanne and Rousseau, he learned about archaic and tribal art, which led him toward Cubism.\nPicasso strove to define his place in the history of painting from the outset of his long career. Art historians consider his late works direct dialogues with Old Masters such as Velazquez, Goya and Rembrandt. He lived most of his life in France, so Picasso knew the latest trends and schools of art. Accordingly, he studied Symbolism, which worked to build a visual language of the soul from imagery drawn from mythology and dreams. Picasso also drew on Impressionist Munch to explore the nature of souls. Clearly Lautrec influenced his palette and his choice of subjects – prostitutes and the poor – during his Blue period, so-called because of his blue and gray palette. In fact, much of Picasso’s early work experiments with color – beginning in 1897 in violet and green through the Blue and consequent Rose period and his orange and red palette. This led him to experiment with shape as well, following Cezanne – Post-Impressionism influenced by primitive art – and Rousseau – experiments in Naïve art. Picasso began to use more angular shapes and figures, as well as more color, as he worked toward founding cubism with Braque, where the artist analyzes a subject or shape, disassembles it, then reassembles it in an abstracted form. Working in cubism led Picasso to invent collage and work toward a second form of Cubism (synthetic) where artists worked in mixed media.\nDoc 2(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") ntense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life.

His father was an artist himself, was Picasso’s first and most formative art teacher. Picasso has one of the most prolific creative careers in history, and his work was not only loved by art lovers around the world, but it was also incredibly influential for artists everywhere. But what was Picasso’s inspiration? What inspired these famous works?\nPicasso went through many creative phases in his career. These phases have been labeled as “periods” and show the different styles and mediums he was experimenting with during that time in his life. Picasso's “Blue Period” started in 1901 and lasted until 1904. During this period, Picasso painted mostly in cool blue and green tones, sometimes using a warmer color to accent his works. These pieces have a melancholy about them, and are quite somber, featuring scenes of poverty and desolation. What was Picasso’s inspiration to start painting in this way? In the spring of 1901, one of Picasso’s dear friends, a painter and poet named Carlos Casagemas, committed suicide in a cafe in Paris. Picasso was deeply affected by his death, and sank into a depression that lasted several years. Picasso’s journey through his grief and depression is clearly reflected in his “Blue Period.”\nIn 1904, Picasso moved to Montmartre in Paris, and settled into the community of bohemian artists and creators there.

I think all the structures and incentive systems need to support a commitment to the public good if we’re going to move beyond the current siloed, fragmented nature of the education system.

It was following Lemurs around for three weeks in Madagascar and learning to see patterns and disruption, and what happens when a system is disrupted. I think we can learn a lot from nature as we reimagine our learning and education system.\n[00:43:30] Kelly Young: What all of you are pointing to is that we don’t have healthy communities or healthy ecosystems that go well beyond education. This work is about putting human relationship at the center of it, revitalizing communities that have been oppressed and suppressed for generations, and about how we restore their ability to govern, contribute, and create meaning of learning. And, not have it imposed on them.\n[00:44:29] Joe Hobot: I’d like to build off what Timothy said about the importance of recognizing community-based organizations as an integral partner in this journey.

And, there’s a relationship piece that’s already been demonstrated in and supported by the community-based organizations’ work. This is where we get into a new modicum of partnership, where public schools in some of the more progressive areas like Minneapolis or Portland have understood that this is not their place—that they need to partner and lift up the CBO’s to allow them to do the work. Because, they’re more effective at it and it’s humbling for the public education system to have to do that.\nIt comes back to that question: Where does public education lead? Well, they lead by stepping back and following, and providing technical assistance for the CBO’s, which are really out there. That’s the good news: they’re deployed within the field and they’re out there doing good work and have been for decades. What an asset. Let’s start leveraging and utilizing these assets.\nThe other good news is they’re already doing this work without fear of sanction or waiting for approval.

Picasso has one of the most prolific creative careers in history, and his work was not only loved by art lovers around the world, but it was also incredibly influential for artists everywhere. But what was Picasso’s inspiration? What inspired these famous works?\nPicasso went through many creative phases in his career. These phases have been labeled as “periods” and show the different styles and mediums he was experimenting with during that time in his life. Picasso's “Blue Period” started in 1901 and lasted until 1904. During this period, Picasso painted mostly in cool blue and green tones, sometimes using a warmer color to accent his works. These pieces have a melancholy about them, and are quite somber, featuring scenes of poverty and desolation. What was Picasso’s inspiration to start painting in this way? In the spring of 1901, one of Picasso’s dear friends, a painter and poet named Carlos Casagemas, committed suicide in a cafe in Paris. Picasso was deeply affected by his death, and sank into a depression that lasted several years. Picasso’s journey through his grief and depression is clearly reflected in his “Blue Period.”\nIn 1904, Picasso moved to Montmartre in Paris, and settled into the community of bohemian artists and creators there. Coming out of his depression over his friend’s death, Picasso moved on from dark and serious subjects in his paintings to more lighthearted compositions featuring harlequins, clowns and carnival performers. His color palette warmed up as well, with his paintings now bathed in reds, oranges, pinks and earth tones. This period would be known as Picasso's “Rose Period” and it lasted until 1906. So what can be credited with this major shift in his work? Picasso met a woman named Fernande Olivier in 1904 and they began a relationship that lasted seven years. Olivier would be the first of a long line of women who were muses and lovers to Picasso over the years. This relationship and the end of his bout of depression signaled a more positive phase of Picasso’s life. The overall tone of his work during this period is much more carefree and less somber.\nCiting beautiful women as inspiration would become a theme in Picasso’s life, all the way up until his death. Picasso has been quoted saying: “For me there are only two kinds of women, goddesses and doormats.” He often became obsessed with a young woman and she became an artistic muse for him, inspiring many works. All of the women Picasso took as either wives or lovers were painted by the artist. His second wife Jacqueline Roque was the subject of over 400 portraits by Picasso, and was a great source of inspiration to him.\nFrom 1906-1909 Picasso was heavily inspired by African art, after he was exposed to traditional African masks and other art objects coming from Africa into French museums in Paris. This phase has been called his “African Period,” and was a precursor to his most famous period, “Cubism.” Influenced by Paul Cezanne’s experimentation with three-dimensional spacing and perspective, Picasso and Georges Braque pioneered the artistic movement known as Cubism. This way of breaking down a form to its most basic forms and reconstructing them in an abstracted way is what Picasso is most known for.\nSo what can we say was Picasso's inspiration?\nThroughout his life, Picasso's inspiration came in many different forms. Whether it be working through his emotions, responding to a difficult life event, meeting a beautiful young woman, an intense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art.

I think all the structures and incentive systems need to support a commitment to the public good if we’re going to move beyond the current siloed, fragmented nature of the education system. And, that isn’t going to happen on its own. It has to be consciously reflected on and then involve a study of how nature works.\nThat’s really what taught me to be a photographer.

I think we can learn a lot from nature as we reimagine our learning and education system.\n[00:43:30] Kelly Young: What all of you are pointing to is that we don’t have healthy communities or healthy ecosystems that go well beyond education. This work is about putting human relationship at the center of it, revitalizing communities that have been oppressed and suppressed for generations, and about how we restore their ability to govern, contribute, and create meaning of learning. And, not have it imposed on them.\n[00:44:29] Joe Hobot: I’d like to build off what Timothy said about the importance of recognizing community-based organizations as an integral partner in this journey. As we talk about the holistic approach to whole child development and building communities that are able to thrive, it’s important to note that community-based organizations have been at the forefront of these activities, including in our own efforts.\nWe are led and staffed by the community that we’re embedded in. And, there’s a relationship piece that’s already been demonstrated in and supported by the community-based organizations’ work. This is where we get into a new modicum of partnership, where public schools in some of the more progressive areas like Minneapolis or Portland have understood that this is not their place—that they need to partner and lift up the CBO’s to allow them to do the work. Because, they’re more effective at it and it’s humbling for the public education system to have to do that.\nIt comes back to that question: Where does public education lead? Well, they lead by stepping back and following, and providing technical assistance for the CBO’s, which are really out there. That’s the good news: they’re deployed within the field and they’re out there doing good work and have been for decades. What an asset. Let’s start leveraging and utilizing these assets.\nThe other good news is they’re already doing this work without fear of sanction or waiting for approval. It’s really putting a spotlight and connecting these partnerships and public education, and realizing that these solutions are already embedded within the community as reflected in CBO’s.\nAudience Q&A\nQ. What is the role of public libraries in an ecosystem?\nTimothy Jones: It depends on the actual assets and resources that are in the library. A library really has to be that cross-generational hub, whether virtually or in-person, where you have people in the community who are present. You have elders, young people, and teenagers that are there. It goes far beyond the books. The library is where you should be able to have community exhibitions and other community gatherings.\nThe library, in many ways, could be the nondenominational function that the church once was in the past, where people came together and where you got all of your information.\nLooking at hip-hop as the exemplar for building community and fostering knowledge could be powerful.

Classically trained in the European school, Picasso emerged as a symbolist, drawing on Impressionism through Munch and Post-Impressionism via Lautrec. From Cézanne and Rousseau, he learned about archaic and tribal art, which led him toward Cubism.\nPicasso strove to define his place in the history of painting from the outset of his long career. Art historians consider his late works direct dialogues with Old Masters such as Velazquez, Goya and Rembrandt. He lived most of his life in France, so Picasso knew the latest trends and schools of art. Accordingly, he studied Symbolism, which worked to build a visual language of the soul from imagery drawn from mythology and dreams. Picasso also drew on Impressionist Munch to explore the nature of souls. Clearly Lautrec influenced his palette and his choice of subjects – prostitutes and the poor – during his Blue period, so-called because of his blue and gray palette. In fact, much of Picasso’s early work experiments with color – beginning in 1897 in violet and green through the Blue and consequent Rose period and his orange and red palette. This led him to experiment with shape as well, following Cezanne – Post-Impressionism influenced by primitive art – and Rousseau – experiments in Naïve art. Picasso began to use more angular shapes and figures, as well as more color, as he worked toward founding cubism with Braque, where the artist analyzes a subject or shape, disassembles it, then reassembles it in an abstracted form. Working in cubism led Picasso to invent collage and work toward a second form of Cubism (synthetic) where artists worked in mixed media.\nDoc 2(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") ntense love affair or the work of his fellow artists, Picasso took inspiration from everywhere in his life. In turn, his life’s work has inspired and influenced millions of people around the world and forever changed the history of art. There is no denying the power of Picasso’s creative mind, and the effects of his stylistic experimentation in Cubism shaped the artistic movements that followed him. As an artist who would come to influence so many artists himself, Picasso is a pillar in the modern art world with a fascinating life full of inspiration.\nFrom https://news.masterworksfineart.com/2019/11/28/what-was-picassos-inspiration .\n* As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\nDoc 3(Title: \"What was Picasso’s inspiration? - Masterworks Fine Art\") Pablo Picasso*, born in 1881 in Malaga, Spain, and died in 1973 in Mougins, France, was an active artist for most of his long life.

De Stijl, the movement he was associated with, emphasized the purity of form and color. While Mondrian was influenced by Cubism, particularly in his early works, he eventually moved away from its complex forms towards a more simplified, geometric style. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Mondrian viewed Cubism as a step towards his ultimate goal of pure abstraction, but also recognized its limitations in achieving this goal.\n\n<answer> Piet Mondrian viewed Cubism as a precursor to his own artistic philosophy, seeing it as a step towards pure abstraction, but also recognizing its limitations in achieving this goal.

Airbnb likely adapted their business model to focus on more local stays and experiences rather than international travel.\n</think>\n\n<search> how airbnb adapted during pandemic </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"How Airbnb Survived The Pandemic—And How You Can Too\") Airbnb has come back from the brink. Mere months after the Covid-19 pandemic caused its bookings to drop over 70% and cut in half its valuation, the company has pulled off a dramatic recovery and is headed toward an IPO with an expected valuation of $30 billion. How Airbnb survived the pandemic serves a playbook for turning around your business.\nCertainly the company was buoyed by the $1 billion lifeline it received from private equity firm Silver Lake back in April. It also wisely cut nearly $1 billion in marketing costs and slashed executive salaries by half. Plus, the business is well-positioned to appeal to travelers who wanted to stay away from larger hotels and remote workers looking for long-term rentals. But the strategies that CEO Brian Chesky and other executives adopted during the crisis – focus on the core business, address customer emotions, and meet employee needs — enabled them to turnaround the company so quickly.\nScale Back to Move Forward\nChesky and the executive team quickly realized that substantive changes to the business were needed. \"Travel as we knew it is over,\" Chesky observed early on. \"It doesn't mean travel is over, just the travel we knew is over, and it's never coming back.\"\nSo they quickly refocused on Airbnb’s core business — home rentals – and streamlined ancillary offerings including “Experiences” and traditional hotel and luxury property listings. They also scaled back what had been aggressive bets on markets further afield such as transportation and media. Some of these were Chesky’s pet projects and seemed to hold greater potential for achieve the company’s lofty aspirations. But the leaders realized the company’s future depended upon a sole focus on the core business.\nHow about you? Have you stopped holding out for business to go back to “normal” and are you ready to make significant changes? How should you scale back to focus on your core? Are you willing to exit markets and abandon new opportunities so you can do fewer things better – and with fewer resources? Focus enables you to shore up value in the core driver of your future success.\nCare for Customers\nAirbnb assessed what customers were feeling and went to great lengths to address their emotions. Chesky and his executives understood customers would be reluctant to make new reservations given the uncertainty of travel restrictions and potential pandemic surges. So they decided to institute a blanket refund policy offering last-minute cancellations and full refunds. Initially the change wasn’t rolled out clearly and caused confusion and anger among some customers as well as hosts, but the company worked hard to rectify problems and reassure people it had their backs. In doing so, it provided relief for customers’ apprehensions and convinced hesitant people to proceed with bookings.\nAirbnb’s executives also understood customers’ fears about health and safety, so they introduced “Enhanced Cleaning” procedures and recommended hosts increase the time between guest stays. The changes were not mandatory, but hosts who adopted them were given a badge to display on their listings, thus conveying transparency and reassuring concerned customers.\nAirbnb went beyond the basics of customer service and assuaged their feelings. Are you focused on your customers’ emotions – or are you only concerned with operations and transactions? Do you understand how customers are feeling and what they want and expect now? By implementing changes designed specifically to address customers’ emotions, you earn their trust.\nProvide for Your People\nWhen Airbnb laid off nearly 2,000 employees, 25% of its workforce, back in May, Chesky was praised for the humility and sincerity with which he addressed employees. But in addition to compassion, the company provided real help for laid-off employees. They were allowed to keep company-issued laptops and U.S. employees received a year of health insurance.

But the founders did not let this happen. They knew that the long-term prospects looked bright.\nAccording to the founders: “A crisis brings you clarity about what is truly important. You become thankful for not only what you have in your life, but for who you have in your life. We are thankful for everyone who stuck by us during our darkest hours.”\nTom (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member to startups and the author of Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction and The Robotic Process Automation Handbook: A Guide to Implementing RPA Systems. He also has developed various online courses, such as for the COBOL and Python programming languages.\nDoc 3(Title: \"How Airbnb Beat The Covid-19 Virus - Forbes\") Going into 2020, Airbnb was growing at a rapid pace and aggressively expanding into new categories. So what could possibly go wrong?\nWell, within a couple months, the Covid-19 pandemic would shutdown the travel industry. And suddenly Airbnb was facing an existential crisis.\nBy April, the gross bookings for nights and experiences plunged by 72% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, from March to April, there were more cancellations than bookings!\nWhile the situation was certainly dire, the management team wasted little time in pursuing a major restructuring. The result was that—over time—the business started to improve. By June, there was actually a 1% increase in gross bookings.\nNow this is not to say that the business is no longer under pressure. The fact remains that revenues are still well off the levels of 2019. But then again, Airbnb has weathered the pandemic relatively well compared to other major travel operators, whether hotel chains or online marketplaces.\nSo why is this so? What did Airbnb do? Let’s take a look:\nCost Cutting: The mantra of Silicon Valley is high growth. But this philosophy makes no sense when the market is experiencing huge problems.\nIn the situation of Airbnb, management initiated a layoff of 25% of the workforce. There was also a steep reduction in discretionary and capital expenditures, a slashing of executive salaries and a suspension of all facilities build-outs.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nAirbnb CEO and founder, Brian Chesky, set forth this plan in a letter that was sent to employees and published on the company blog. He did not mince words, saying “I have to share some very sad news.” He would go on to be thoughtful, transparent and clear about the “hard truths.”\nChesky also set forth a variety of principles about how the restructuring would be handled:\n- Map all reductions to our future business strategy and the capabilities we will need.\n- Do as much as we can for those who are impacted.\n- Be unwavering in our commitment to diversity.\n- Optimize for 1:1 communication for those impacted.\n- Wait to communicate any decisions until all details are landed — transparency of only partial information can make matters worse.\nFocus On The Core Business: In the shareholder letter in the S-1, the founders noted: “When the pandemic hit, we knew we couldn’t pursue everything that we used to. We chose to focus on what is most unique about Airbnb—our core business of hosting. We got back to our roots and back to what is truly special about Airbnb—the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences. We scaled back investments that did not directly support the core of our host community.”\nThis move proved critical. As the pandemic deepened, people were looking more at local stays—and this played to the advantage of Airbnb. It was one of the biggest factors in the turnaround of the business.\nCreatively-led: When there are severe constraints and limitations, this can lead to even more inspiration. This was certainly the case with the Airbnb team. For example, when the in-person Experiences segment was suspended, this led to the creation of Online Experiences. It turned out to be an extremely popular offering.\nTrust: This is the heart of any successful business. But during times of crisis, it can be tempting to make short-term financial decisions that ultimately undermine trust.\nAn example of this quandary for Airbnb was about the spike in cancellations. Keep in mind that many were non-refundable. But to bolster the marketplace, Airbnb used more than $1 billion of its funding to provide refunds. There was also a commitment of up to $250 million for those hosts that were impacted by the cancellations.\nLong-Term Optimism: During the early days of the pandemic, it would have been easy to lose confidence in the vision of Airbnb. But the founders did not let this happen. They knew that the long-term prospects looked bright.\nAccording to the founders: “\nDoc 4(Title: \"How Airbnb Can Survive COVID-19 After Burning US$1.2B Cash ...\") Last week (7 October), it was reported that vacation rental platform Airbnb has burned through more than US$1.2 billion in cash between mid-2019 and mid-2020.\nThis amounts to more than a third of its cash reserves, according to documents seen by tech news site The Information.\nAccording to The Information, the plunge in global travel has “eroded a balance sheet already weakened by big increases in spending on hiring and marketing.”\nThis raises questions on the fate of Airbnb and whether it would survive the Covid-19 crisis. How can they ever hold on despite the travel blackhole?\nHow COVID-19 Sent Airbnb Spiralling Downwards\nThe pandemic has impacted Airbnb and other travel businesses drastically as global travel came to a standstill.\nAirbnb’s revenue dropped 72 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 to US$335 million.\nIn March, it was reported that European short-term rental reservations had dropped by as much as 80 per cent.\nMeanwhile, revenue was down by more than 50 per cent in American urban destinations like New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, according to data from analysts at AirDNA.\nBy April, Airbnb’s valuation had plummeted to US$18 billion, nearly half of its previous high of US$31 billion.\nAirbnb had to dip into its cash reserves to pay out refunds for cancelled bookings as well as overheads, payroll expenses and more.\nA Bulk Of Cash Went To Travel Refunds\nIn the first quarter of this year, when Covid-19 first broke out, the company had to hand out travel refunds due to customers swiftly cancelling their bookings.\nUnlike Airbnb and Expedia, Booking.com typically collects payments on each reservation after the stay has occurred, which reduced the impact of travel refunds on its balance sheet.\nRefunds wiped out a huge portion of their cash reserves, underscoring how the pandemic depleted Airbnb’s reserves.\nWhile governments implemented lockdowns and global travel came to a standstill, another portion of the funds went to helping the business tide over and pay overheads such as salaries.\nSpending Cutbacks Weren’t Enough\nIn May this year, Airbnb announced a company-wide layoff that saw the retrenchment of 1,900 out of 7,500 employees in a bid to cut costs.\nThe 25 per cent staff cut was substantial in cost savings, but Airbnb gave a generous severance package to those who were let go. This includes several months’ pay, a year of healthcare, and help from Airbnb finding a new job.\nIt was also reported that its founders will forego their salaries for the next six months, and top executives will take a 50 per cent pay cut.\nThe financial documents seen by The Information revealed for the first time when exactly Airbnb reduced spending in the second quarter to try to offset revenue decline.\nThe biggest cuts apparently came from customer service and marketing.\nMeanwhile, spending on product development and general and administrative costs fell by nine per cent collectively over the same period.\nHowever, the second-quarter financials is not likely to reflect the full impact of Airbnb’s layoffs, which was made in the middle of the quarter.\nRegardless, the spending cutbacks weren’t enough to offset the plunge in revenue once the pandemic struck.\nLooming IPO May Save Airbnb From Its US$2B Debt\nIn April, Airbnb had raised US$2 billion in debt from investors at high interest rates amid escalating losses.\nThanks to the debt, Airbnb had US$4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in June.\nThe company still has a significant cash pile (two-thirds of their cash reserves), but how long can this even last?\nBefore the pandemic, the company had been planning on going public via a direct listing.\nA direct listing is where the company would list existing shares on the stock market but it wouldn’t sell new shares to raise cash.\nIt is instead looking to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) in December this year, and aims to raise around US$3 billion.\nReuters reported last wee\nDoc 5(Title: \"Airbnb survived the pandemic and is on the cusp of an IPO\") Photo: Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images for International New York Time / Illustration by The Hustle\nAirbnb is back from the brink.\nSeven months removed from one of the darkest periods in CEO Brian Chesky’s tenure at the helm, things are looking a lot rosier.\nThe pandemic’s abrupt arrival in March brought travel to a halt, and with it, Airbnb saw a devastating drop in business. During one stretch, bookings in Europe were down 80% vs. the same period in 2019.\nHosts across the US were left with a cascading run of cancellations that threatened to cripple the company’s critical partners.\nShort on cash, Chesky laid off thousands\nHe refocused on Airbnb’s core travel business, scaling back aggressive bets like Experiences.\nChesky provided refunds to guests, then had to repair relations with hosts, using part of a $1B lifeline from private equity firm Silver Lake to help.\nSlowly, things started to turn\nWhile Americans weren’t traveling overseas as much, or even cross-country, remote work created a new demand for shorter distance stays.\nAverage stay length increased 18% to 4.27 days from January to June, while bookings recovered and outpaced 2019 levels during the same period.\nWith things back on track, the company recently filed to go public, setting the stage for a December IPO that will likely be one of the year’s hottest debuts.\nWho’s getting paid?\nNot me, but a lot of other people.\n- Founders: Chesky and fellow cofounders Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk are sitting pretty; Chesky’s stake is worth $3B to $4B.\n- Early investors: Y Combinator scored a 6% stake for $20k (this bet is going in the VC hall of fame) and legendary VC firm Sequoia got in early at the seed ($600k) and Series A ($7.2m) rounds.\n- Private Equity: Silver Lake lent the suddenly cash-strapped Airbnb $1B at an $18B valuation — roughly half what it was worth in 2017.\nIf this payday wasn’t enough, Airbnb just pulled a massive personnel coup, landing Apple’s former design chief, Sir Jony Ive.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information gathered, Airbnb survived the pandemic through several key strategies:\n\n1. **Cost Cutting**: They initiated layoffs, reduced discretionary and capital expenditures, slashed executive salaries, and suspended facility build-outs. This helped them conserve cash.\n\n2. **Focusing on Core Business**: They refocused on their core business of home rentals and scaled back investments in new areas like Experiences and traditional hotel and luxury property listings.\n\n3. **Customer Care**: They provided refunds to guests and addressed customer concerns about health and safety by introducing enhanced cleaning procedures and badges for hosts who followed these procedures.\n\n4. **Employee Support**: They provided generous severance packages and health insurance to laid-off employees, showing care for their people.\n\n5. **Long-Term Optimism**: Despite the challenges, the company maintained a positive outlook and kept working towards their long-term goals.\n\nThese strategies helped Airbnb navigate the challenging times and position themselves for a successful recovery. </think>\n\n<answer> Airbnb survived the pandemic through cost cutting, focusing on their core business, providing excellent customer care, supporting their employees, and maintaining long-term optimism. </answer>",

Instead you take it to the cashier and they calculate the price. What you pay could be twice as much, or more, than an hour earlier. That’s if there is even anything left in stock.\nThis is the economic reality that underpins Venezuela’s current “political crisis” – though in truth that crisis has been going on for years.\nThe government headed by Nicolás Maduro, who has presided over Venezuela since 2013, declared a state of emergency in 2016. That year the inflation rate hit 800%. Things have since gone from bad to worse.\nBy 2018 inflation was an estimated 80,000%. It’s difficult to say what the rate is now, but Bloomberg’s Venezuelan Cafe Con Leche Index, based on the price of a cup of coffee, suggests it is now about 380,000%.\nAbout 3 million Venezuelans – a tenth of the population – have fled the country. This is the largest human displacement in Latin American history, driven by shortages of everything including food as well as the Maduro regime’s oppressive treatment of dissent.\nRead more: Venezuela is fast becoming a 'mafia state': here's what you need to know\nNo wonder, then, that Maduro, who has just begun his second term as president, is now under considerable domestic and international pressure to call new elections.\nSo how did things get so bad? How did inflation become hyperinflation in Venezuela? And how do Venezuelans deal with it?\nThe cost of goods and the value of currency\nWhat we pay for goods and services reflects not only their cost of production but also of the value of the currency we buy them in. If that currency loses value against the currency the goods are sold in, the price of those goods goes up.\nBy 2014 the value of Venezuela’s currency, the bolívar, and the prosperity of the Venezuelan economy, was highly dependent on oil exports. More than 90% of the country’s export earnings came from oil.\nThese export earnings had enabled the government headed by Hugo Chavez from 1999 to 2013 to pay for social programs intended to combat poverty and inequality. From subsidies for those on low incomes to health services, the government’s spending obligations were high.\nThen the global price of oil dropped. Foreign demand for the bolívar to buy Venezuelan oil crashed. As the currency’s value fell, the cost of imported goods rose. The Venezuelan economy went into crisis.\nThe solution of Venezuela’s new president Nicolas Maduro, who succeeded Chavez in March 2013, was to print more money.\nThat might seem silly, but it can keep the economy moving while it gets over a hump caused by a short-term price shock.\nThe Venezuelan crisis, however, just got worse as the oil price continued to fall, compounded by other factors that reduced Venezuelan oil output. International investors began looking elsewhere, driving the value of the bolívar even lower.\nRead more: Curious Kids: why don’t poorer countries just print more money?\nIn these conditions, printing more money simply made the problem worse. It added to the supply of currency, pushing the value down even further. As prices rose, the government printed more money to pay its bills. This cycle is what causes hyperinflation.\nPlaying the currency market\nCircumstances like these quickly make saving money in the local currency nonsensical. To protect themselves, Venezuelans started to convert their savings into a more stable currency, like the US dollar. This lowered the value of the bolívar even further.\nThe government responded by issuing currency controls. It set a fixed exchange rate, to stop the official value of the bolívar dropping against the US dollar, and made it difficult to actually get permission to exchange bolívares into US dollars. The idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions.\nUS dollars were still available on the black market, however. This meant going to any number of operators on the streets of downtown Caracas or asking a friend to hoo\nDoc 3(Title: \"Venezuela Inflation Calculator: VEF from 1980 to 2020\") $100 in 1980 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $14,014,141,891,526.36 today, an increase of $14,014,141,891,426.36 over 41 years. The bolivar had an average inflation rate of 87.01% per year between 1980 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of 14,014,141,891,426.36%.\nThis means that today's prices are 140,141,418,915.26 times as high as average prices since 1980, according to the International Monetary Fund consumer price index. A bolivar today only buys NaN% of what it could buy back then.\nThe inflation rate in 1980 was 21.40%. The current inflation rate compared to the end of last year is now 2,700.00%. If this number holds, $100 today will be equivalent in buying power to $2,800.00 next year.\nThis chart shows a calculation of buying power equivalence for $100 in 1980 (price index tracking began in 1979).\nFor example, if you started with $100, you would need to end with $14,014,141,891,526.36 in order to \"adjust\" for inflation (sometimes refered to as \"beating inflation\").\nWhen $100 is equivalent to $14,014,141,891,526.36 over time, that means that the \"real value\" of a single Venezuelan bolivar decreases over time. In other words, a bolivar will pay for fewer items at the store.\nThis effect explains how inflation erodes the value of a bolivar over time. By calculating the value in 1980 dollars, the chart below shows how $100 is worth less over 41 years.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, each of these VEF amounts below is equal in terms of what it could buy at the time:\nThis conversion table shows various other 1980 amounts in today's bolivars, based on the 14,014,141,891,426.36% change in prices:\nOur calculations use the following inflation rate formula to calculate the change in value between 1980 and today:\nThen plug in historical CPI values.

The more money the government prints, the less your dollar is worth.\nThe main causes of inflation are:\n- The economy is growing too quickly and there is greater demand for goods and services, than there is supply.\n- Supply is reduced and there is greater demand for fewer goods, thus driving up prices.\n- The government increases the money supply, so the dollar is worth less, due to a greater supply of money in the economy.\n- Higher wages, which increase firms costs and consumers disposable income, thereby boosting demand and driving up prices.\nSimply put, inflation causes each dollar to be less valuable than before and purchase fewer goods and services than in the past.\nDuring the recent Corona Virus pandemic, global trade was interrupted, and production for many goods and their inputs was stalled. Production slowed across the globe, as did international transportation. This caused bottlenecks in supplies and shortages of important materials and products. As supply chains withered, demand remained steady causing prices, and subsequently inflation to increase.\nDespite tempered inflation pf 4.1% in 2023, this increase on top of 2022’s 5.0% surge is causing hardship for consumers, and businesses. Goods and services are more expensive, and the dollar buys less than it had in the recent past.\nAccording to Lawrence H. White at econlib.org, inflation rates since 1950, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), ranged from -0.7% in 1954 to a high of 13.3% in 1979. Although since 1991, the inflation rate has remained relatively constant, between 1.6% and 3.3% per year, until 2021.\nUsing the latest US government CPI data from usinflationcalculator.com, an item that cost $100 in 1980 would cost $381.28 in mid-2024 for a 281.3% increase.\nYou need to learn how to prepare for inflation at home, and while shopping and traveling.\nThe first two decades of the 2000’s spoiled us, but now we are back to a higher inflation period.

The idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions.\nUS dollars were still available on the black market, however. This meant going to any number of operators on the streets of downtown Caracas or asking a friend to hook you up. As the crisis deepened, more and more Venezuelans looked to switch their bolívares into US dollars.\nThis increasing demand meant the black market price for greenbacks rose, creating a difference between the official exchange rate (set by the government) and the unofficial going rate.\nWith this came new opportunities. In 2014 reports emerged that groups of middle-aged women were crossing the border to use ATMs in Colombia. They could withdraw funds from their Venezuelan accounts as US dollars at the official rate. They could then cross back into Venezuela and exchange the dollars for bolívares at the unofficial rate, making a tidy profit. Government officials able to exchange bolívares for US dollars within Venezuela had their own version of this practice.\nThis pushed the price of US dollars up, and that of bolívars down, even more. As the crisis deepened increasing numbers of ordinary Venezuelans began to engage in the unofficial currency market.\nSometimes this took the form of taking subsidised Venezuelan goods like food across the border to sell. This earned the sellers foreign currency, but it also exacerbated shortages of goods within the country, driving prices up even further.\nThis does not mean Venezuela’s currency crisis is the fault of ordinary Venezuelans. Illegal economic activity is largely a coping mechanism, a bellwether of the actual economy’s ability to provide for people. When a government fails its responsibilities, it should be no surprise that people protect themselves through unofficial currency trading. This is exactly what big international investors do all the time, albeit through more official channels.\nCannot be trusted\nBy August 2018 the Venezuelan currency was worth so little that it was more prudent to use cash for toilet paper rather than buy toilet paper.\nThe government tried to get on top of this situation by issuing a currency devaluation. Maduro devalued the bolívar by 95%, the largest currency devaluation in contemporary world history. He also tied the new currency to the price of oil, an economic experiment designed to show the Venezuelan economy had solid foundations.\nBy bringing the bolívar’s value into line with the reality of what people actually thought it was worth, and showing it was backed by something valuable, oil, Maduro’s government hoped Venezuelans would believe in their own currency and not exchange it for dollars. This would help stabilise the economy overall.\nBut within weeks of the devaluation it was clear ordinary Venezuelans had not been convinced.\nThey had no reason to be, given the government was not addressing other issues, such as policies contributing to low productivity across the economy. The government’s increasing authoritarianism, including interfering with the constitution and elections, also signalled it was not to be trusted.\nRead more: Is authoritarianism bad for the economy? Ask Venezuela – or Hungary or Turkey\nHyperinflation is a very difficult hole out of which to climb. Very few economies ever experience it, and it’s hard to stop it without massively cutting government spending.\nIt is easy, then, to see why millions of Venezuelans responded by dealing in the black market or taking their savings, and themselves, out the country altogether.\nAs the political crisis in the country deepens, Venezuelans will have to continue to seek ways to allow them to survive the storm any way they can.\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the documents reviewed, Venezuela's inflation rate has been extremely high and has shown no signs of slowing down.

Regardless of what I’ve been going through over the years, I’ve learned that there will always be someone enduring even greater struggles. Yes, I have barriers and limitations with my heart defect that affect my social life. For example, if I happen to fall or trip, I have more concerns than others because I am on a blood thinner, which means my bleeding won’t stop easily. I often ponder when precisely the best time is to disclose my heart defect to new friends, it is a tough balance between realizing that it is such a significant part of my life and who I am while also avoiding the “poor me” mentality that can come with the disclosure. But my fellow young adult heart patient peers and I often ask ourselves this question: If it wasn’t for our heart defects, how exactly would our social lives be different? Would we be playing contact sports or having more than two alcoholic beverages when we’re out with friends? For me, the answer is easy. No, it wouldn’t be much different.\nLet me address one barrier at a time. First: restrictions on contact sports. Growing up, I was a stereotypical “theater geek”. The closest thing I got to contact sports were dance classes and musical theater choreography, and my motto was often, “I can’t, I have rehearsal.” It was my passion. Even if I could play sports, like soccer or softball, I don’t think I would have. I participated in gym classes in elementary school and had a very understanding gym teacher who allowed me to rest when needed. The backlash came from my peers, who often couldn’t understand why they could not sit down and rest while I could. But there were other times when my close friends ran the last length of our mile run right along side me just so I wouldn’t be alone. It was recommended by my teachers and doctors that I be excused from the more rigorous gym class curriculum in middle and high school, but I still remained active, walking, bike riding, swimming and dancing as often as possible. I’ve met many heart patients who are bothered by not being able to participate in contact sports, but I’ve dedicated my extra-curricular time on other activities that are more heart-friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed.\nThe second barrier that has had an effect on my social life is going out and having a good time with friends, which is a big part of most young adult lives. I’ve developed the mentality that I can still do this while not jeopardizing my health. Even in college, I preferred attending a movie night with friends than going to a party and I was thankful to find groups who provided my kind of social events. Even though the decision was easy for me, it was more difficult for some of my peers to understand. I’ve been questioned multiple times by friends, been told that, “I have a family member with a heart defect that drinks a lot, why can’t you?” I’ve been told that friends are concerned that I’m not having a good time because I am not drinking as much as they are. I care too much about my heart, effects on medications, and my health to do that to myself, and I’ve learned that my close friends not only don’t question my personal decision not to drink excessively, but support it wholeheartedly.\nI have been so grateful over the past 13 years to develop a strong family of fellow heart patients. Thanks to Camp Odayin, a camp for kids with heart conditions, where I began as a camper and now remain involved as a volunteer counselor, I have close friends that share my mindset about our barriers as heart patients. We may not be exactly like other young adults, but we still live full and active lives.\nAs a counselor, I’ve continued to enjoy watching campers form these bonds and begin to realize just how important these friendships will be throughout their entire lives.

One way to think about heart disease risks and corresponding lifestyle changes is the acronym ABCDES:\nAlcohol\nBlood pressure\nCholesterol\nDiabetes\nExercise\nSmoking\nLet's go through each of these elements.\nAvoid alcohol in excess\nWhile the benefit of light to moderate alcohol consumption is somewhat controversial, excessive alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk for death, heart disease, and liver disease. Studies show harm occurs when individuals consume more than 100 grams of alcohol, or about 7 drinks, per week. A standard drink — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits — contains 14 grams of alcohol.\nWhich diet can lower blood pressure?\nFollowing a healthy dietary pattern, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, can help to lower blood pressure. The DASH diet is specifically designed to lower blood pressure. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, legumes, nuts, seeds, and lean meats. These foods are typically high in fiber and low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.\nStudies suggest that the DASH diet can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by about 8 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) by about 4 mm Hg, and reduce mortality.\nHow can I lower cholesterol?\nElevated cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease and is associated with higher risk of death. While genetics play a role, excessive weight, physical inactivity, type 2 diabetes, and excessive alcohol intake also contribute to high cholesterol.\nResearch suggests that reducing saturated fat in the diet and replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat may lower cardiovascular risk. This means replacing butter, coconut oil, palm oil, shortening, or lard with olive, safflower, canola, corn, sesame, soybean, and sunflower oils.\nThe Mediterranean diet has been found to lower cholesterol and reduce CVD risk. This diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, with limited consumption of red meat and sweets. Olive oil is the main source of dietary fat.\nEating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, trout, tuna, herring, and mackerel, also helps to reduce heart disease risk.\nHow can I reduce my risk for diabetes?\nDiabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease. Fortunately, lifestyle changes can help. For example, if you have prediabetes, losing at least 7% of body weight and engaging in 150 minutes or more per week of moderate-intensit\nDoc 4(Title: \"Lifestyle changes to lower heart disease risk - Harvard Health\") s to reduce heart disease risk.\nHow can I reduce my risk for diabetes?\nDiabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease. Fortunately, lifestyle changes can help. For example, if you have prediabetes, losing at least 7% of body weight and engaging in 150 minutes or more per week of moderate-intensity physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes.\nHealthy diets, such as the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, and plant-based diets emphasizing foods higher in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, and lower in glycemic load and saturated fats, are also recommended.\nHow much exercise do I need?\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the US Department of Health and Human Services recommend that all adults ages 18 to 64 engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week — or an equivalent mix of the two. Activities such as brisk walking, running, swimming, biking, and other aerobic exercises are all good options.\nAs a general rule, being active is better than being sedentary. For example, taking at least 4,400 steps daily is associated with lower risk of death than taking only 2,700 steps per day.\nHow bad is smoking for my health?\nSmokers have a higher heart disease risk than never-smokers, and two to three times the risk of death. The more you smoke, the higher your risk of death.\nQuit-smoking medications like varenicline (Chantix) and bupropion (Wellbutrin), and nicotine replacement therapies, are generally safe and can effectively help people quit smoking..\nAbout the Author\nJames Yeh, MD, MPH, Contributor\nDisclaimer:\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

Mesocarb is identified as amphetamine psychostimulant that has a strong effect on the central nervous system. Moreover, this substance causes addiction and is used by drug addicts. This element is prohibited in sports. According to the World Anti-Doping Agency’s, mesocarb has various side effects, such as:\n- Increased irritability\n- Insomnia\n- Anxiety\n- Anorexia\n- The Ad allergic reactions\n- Hallucinations\nFinally, in the framework of identifying the banned substances, it is vital to mention the anabolic agents. For example, testosterone is widely used in sports. The side effects of the anabolic substances are:\n- Increased possibility to suffer from hepatitis\n- Gonadal atrophy\n- Hallucinations (Hoberman and Yesalis 63)\nThe usage of these substances was commonly widespread during the World War II, when German soldiers were required to apply steroids in order to increase aggressiveness and decrease weakness.\nIt is needless to say that performance enhancing drugs tremendously influences not only Olympians champions, but also those who are on the ladder to achieve success in sport, especially high schools sportsmen.

Unfortunately, many students do not comprehend that these banned substances cause addiction and even lethal ending. The effect of these drugs on the teenagers’ health is absolutely similar to the adult organism.

The strong demand to be the first combining with the social request for excellence has influenced the sportsmen to find alternative means how to satisfy modern requirements. Nowadays, athletes have faced a controversial issue, regarding their choice to sue banned substances in order to show great results or to be a normal citizen. By the normal citizen, it is meant not to do everything possible and impossible in order to achieve high positions in sports. However, there is a side effect, known as depression, caused by inability to be the first, jealousy and inner malice. In this case, the role of surrounding cannot be overestimated. First of all, coaches have the biggest influence on the young athletes. Thus, these mentors should show not only understanding to the athlete, but also demonstrate high psychological support.\nLooking at the above mentioned issues that may cause depression, it is necessary to mention the appropriate treatment that will be helpful in diagnosing addicted athletes and their mental recovery.

Coming together and sharing a meal is the most communal and binding thing in almost every place in the world. Being able to make a dish and share that with the people you love is one of the most universal concepts because it's at the root of our survival. We all have to eat, and being able to learn how to make a recipe from your mother is one of the oldest traditions of mankind. It feels really good to learn and hone a technique from your parents and pass it down to your kids. This idea of carrying on the legacy and sharing recipes that have been in our family for generations is something that is so incredibly special. My first memories of food are with my Abuela and Mom in the kitchen, learning about our family traditions through dishes that have been passed down and I am so excited to share these with my son.\nFood is also a great vehicle for sharing culture with people from different backgrounds. I lived in New York for a very long time and I remember having dinner parties and big BBQs as a young adult and those were some of the coolest experiences because we would get to taste and share dishes from all over the world. One guest would bring kimchee that their Korean grandmother taught them to make and someone else would bring a Caribbean salad that they grew up eating and so on. Then I would have some braised and grilled meats at the center and we would all share what was in our dishes and how and why we came to know and love them. This is what makes food so special, it is at the center of all cultures and family gatherings. We have many of our biggest moments in life either preparing or sharing a meal.\nThis question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Eating is essential for most forms of life, and experimenting with different spices, ingredients and recipes is a common way to socialize.\nThink about it – most holidays or family gatherings include a meal that is served every year. Food is tied to tradition; food is tied to memories, and many people don’t realize the importance of food as a way to bring people together.\nIn fact, food is so ingrained in our social landscape that it’s hard to imagine any kind of gathering without it. From holidays to a summer barbecue to meeting friends for lunch, to family dinners, food is almost always involved, often serving as the main attraction. Even holidays and key family traditions can center around certain meals and foods. Thanksgiving wouldn’t be the same without turkey, just as Christmas wouldn’t be the same without ham for many families.\nResearchers from the University of Oxford recently found a correlation between how often people eat with others and their life satisfaction. Their results suggest that the more often one eats with others, the more likely they are to feel satisfied and happy with their lives. Socializing is important for one’s physical and mental wellbeing, and social eating plays an important role in bonding with others.\nSocializing with food involved has more pros than cons, including:\n- Instilling a sense of comfort\n- Helping us get out of our comfort zone and trying new things\n- Encouraging a sense of belonging because of common food interests\n- Allowing us to be present and engaged while eating\n- Providing a bonding experience\n- Improving emotional wellbeing\nFood brings people from different cultures together, too. It’s a fantastic vehicle for learning about people with different backgrounds.

Not only is much of this rich diet still common in Mexico today, it's spread around the world. Here's a look at some of what the ancient Mexica peoples ate:\nMaize (also called corn or mealies) was the staple grain of the Aztec empire. Maize has been domesticated for thousands of years, and it likely first came into common use in Mexico, spreading to the rest of the world from there. Mexico is still one of the world's top maize growing countries. Corn could be ground into flour and used to make tortillas (a sort of flat bread, sometimes used to wrap a filling to make tacos), tamales and even drinks. Corn has transformed the world perhaps more than any other food. Today it's used not only in food, including candy and of course feeding the cattle that is eaten, it's even used in things like sticky tape and making boxes.\nHow did all this food grow? Find out about Aztec farming here.\nAztec food also included beans and squash. Of course, maize and beans are still a cornerstone of the Mexican diet, a healthy combination especially if you're not eating a lot of meat.\nTo add to these three, the Mexicas (people of the Aztec Empire) ate chillies, tomatoes, limes, cashews, potatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and of course chocolate. The Mexicas domesticated bees for honey, and turkeys for meat and eggs, also dogs and duck. They hunted and fished as well, and used animals such as deer, rabbits, iguana, fish and shrimp for food. Even insects, such as grasshoppers and worms were harvested. These various types of meat made up only a very minor part of the Aztec food that was eaten.\nOne of the greatest gifts to the world from Mexico is chocolate. The cocoa bean was highly treasured in the Aztec Empire. In fact, the bean was used as a currency, as well as Aztec food. Or, in this case, drink.\nThe cocoa beans were used to make a thick chocolate drink, but far different than the hot chocolate we know today. Since they didn't use sugar, the Mexicas added peppers, corn meal and spices. A similar hot drink is still found in Mexico today with corn, known as atole.\nThough Columbus brought cocoa to Europe in the early 1500s, it was mostly ignored. Hernan Cortes was more interested, and substituted sugar and vanilla for the spices. It became a commercial success.\nThe word chocolate even comes from an Aztec/Mayan word chocolatl.\nChocolate actually may have played a part in the fall of the Aztec empire. The Aztecs believed that the god Quetzalcoatl brought the cocoa beans from the tree of life to give to man. Later, the god was banished. It seems that at first the Mexicas believed that Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquerer, was their returning god.\nThere are some excellent recipes available online. Find a low carb Mixiotes recipe here. There's also a recipe for atole. cdkitchen.com has a unique hot chocolate recipe, a combination of Aztec and Spanish traditions.\nFor more Aztec recipes, try a search at cooks.com.

And How Does a Dairy Farm Work ...\") lly damaging industry, and aside from the fact it makes so many people who consume it sick, dairying affects people in another important way. When we overproduce milk we are being recklessly wasteful of land, water, feed and farmers’ time. Wouldn’t these vital resources be better used in the production of nutritious plant-based foods that are sustainable and essential for optimal health?\nInstead of situating these damaging animal-based industries among poor, underserved communities, often predominantly inhabited by people of color, wouldn’t it be better to grow healthful plant foods that can be made locally available? ‘Food deserts’ is a term commonly used for areas where affordable, healthful food is in short supply, but food justice activists instead talk about ‘food apartheid’, as this issue connects directly to a systemic racism inherent in the food system.\nThere is much that is damaging about the dairy industry, and that is before we even talk about the cows themselves.\nHow Are Cows Treated On Dairy Farms?\nCows are treated as though they are inanimate machinery – you turn on a tap and out comes the milk.\nAs we know, cows produce milk only when they are pregnant, as their breast milk is intended for their babies. Every day that pregnancy is delayed is a day’s loss of milk, and so pregnancy is not left to chance. Cows are artificially inseminated which involves one human hand entering the cow’s anus to manipulate her cervix into position while the other hand inserts a tube of semen into her vagina. Suddenly, milk doesn’t seem quite so wholesome, does it?\nWhen the babies are born, they are taken from their mothers so they don’t actually drink the milk that was made for them. Cows show extreme distress at this separation, often bellowing with grief as any mother would. Cows have been known to break out of farms and trek for miles in search of their calves, such is the strength of their determination and love. And spare a thought for the calves themselves. Newborns need their mothers, and yet they are taken forcibly, and either killed or isolated. Their mothers can only look on and cry out for this to stop but it will happen again and again, as that is the only way to keep the milk flowing.\nIn CAFOs, cows who are naturally grazing animals and have four distinct areas of their stomachs to help them digest grass, are denied access to pasture. They are also denied stimulation, and have nothing to do all day but stand, eat and be milked. And suffer. Standing around is not pain-free when you consider the prevalence of lameness on America’s dairy farms to be up to 55 percent.\nAnd there is an immense biological price to pay for being near-constantly pregnant while simultaneously milked. No wonder, cows break down when still so very young. When they can no longer produce as much milk as is demanded of them, they are trucked to slaughter. It’s not a problem for the farmer, as there are always plenty of female calves who can take the place of their mothers, until they too collapse under the emotional, psychological and physical strain of being a dairy cow.\nIs Dairy Farming Cruel?\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer physically. As well as lameness, there is a high incidence of clinical mastitis – a painful infection of the teats usually caused by bacteria transmitted during the milking process or through living in filthy surroundings. It is so common that it occurs in all dairy herds. Mastitis is extraordinarily painful, and each day, every day, the cows’ infected teats are inserted into machinery to have the milk drawn from them.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer psychologically. Cows are intelligent, sentient beings, with individual personalities, the ability to learn and display long-term memory. They even remember those who have handled them roughly. Cows have needs and desires, but in modern intensive farms they are afforded nothing that makes their lives worthwhile.\nDairy farming is cruel because cows suffer emotion\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information gathered, food brings cultures together in several ways:\n\n1. **Shared Traditions**: Many holidays and family gatherings involve meals that are passed down through generations, creating a sense of tradition and shared heritage. These meals often represent the cultural background of the family or community.\n\n2. **Social Bonding**: Eating together is a universal activity that helps people bond.

During the same two-year time period, skateboard injuries sent 121,398 kids under age 18 to the E.R. Three-quarters of them were boys.\nMost patients were treated and released, but 3 percent of those suffering hoverboard or skateboard injuries were admitted to the hospital. Head injuries accounted for 14 percent of hospital admissions related to hoverboards and 35 percent of admissions for skateboard injuries.\nWhile the majority of skateboarding injuries occurred on the street, the researchers found most hoverboard injuries occurred at home.\nGlatter, who was not involved in the study, said the risk for injuries is significantly increased when a person is multitasking and therefore distracted while riding a hoverboard.\n\"I continue to see young teens with head and wrist injuries in the E.R., often the result of being distracted by using a smartphone and listening to music while riding a hoverboard,\" he said.\nIn 2016, more than 500,000 hoverboards were recalled after dozens of reports that their lithium-ion batteries had burst into flames. In March 2017, a 2-year-old girl died and two other children were injured in a Pennsylvania house fire that officials said was sparked by a hoverboard battery.\nHowever, the study of 2015-16 incidents identified only three cases of burn injuries in children — none of which were from the toys' malfunctioning batteries.\nIn two instances, kids were burned when they rode a hoverboard in the kitchen and collided with a pot of boiling water. The other suffered a friction burn after a hoverboard ran over the child's finger.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics advises against allowing children under age 16 to operate unlicensed motorized wheeled vehicles. Glatter also says he does not recommend allowing young people to use hoverboards at any age.\n\"My personal feeling is that they are unsafe, and I would advise parents against allowing their teens and children to ride them,\" he said. \"That said, I would advise caution if you do allow your child to ride one. It's essential that they wear an appropriate and well-fitted helmet, as well as wrist guards with padding to reduce the risk for injury.\"\nDoc 2(Title: \"A Brief History of Mattel's Failed Hoverboards\") A Brief History of Mattel's Failed Hoverboards\nOn this 'Back to the Future' day, we revisit Mattel's hoverboard blunders.\nAs you’ve no doubt heard a thousand times today, in the 1989 movie Back to the Future II, Michael J. Fox’s Marty McFly traveled to October 21st, 2015 (Did you know that is today?). He rode a hoverboard and wore a puffy varsity jacket:\nAs popularity of the Back to the Future franchise ballooned, the hoverboard, a neon, flying skateboard-without-wheels that looks like a pastel version of Eddie Van Halen’s guitar, became an object of desire. Toy company Mattel seized on that collective want and made its own “hoverboard” in 1989, the year of Back to the Future II’s release.\nExcept, as we all know now, the toy seemed like cruel joke. Given that the first launch of Mattel’s hoverboard occurred in 1989, actual floatation was never going to happen, but the lack of technology did not prevent Mattel from marketing the product with a shameful level of deceit.\nWatch Mattel’s first Hoverboard commercial to see why:\nWhile the colors were “totally rad,” what Mattel actually produced was a cumbersome looking heap of plastic that appeared to float on TV. It is a technicolor scooter with handlebars only a poser would use. It doesn’t even have wheels, so it makes one wonder how the thing actually moved. It didn’t, of course.\nThe dishonest commercial and the toy it hawked roused a backlash among consumers, and it wasn’t until 2012 that Mattel decided to trot out the hoverboard idea again.\nExcept the rebooted toy landed with a resounding thud in that year, even after a decent amount of press and hype got the sci-fi rank and file all worked up. It didn’t float, either. It does offer speaker that emits a “whooshing” sound effect, which is what the hoverboard might sound like if it was hovering.\nUnsurprisingly, there weren’t many positive reviews of the 2012 hoverboard. In fact, some takes on the toy are scathing.\nBob Gale, Back to the Future’s screenwriter, had supported Mattel’s efforts in 2012, but issued a cutting statement on the product once he actually saw it that year. He wasn’t particularly happy about the hoverboard’s $120 price tag, either.\n“This product, at this price, falls short of the top-notch standards that you and I have come to expect for something that carries the Back To The Future brand,” he writes. “The plastic stand is poorly designed and damn near impossible to make work. And although it was indicated that the board would somehow glide across certain smooth surfaces (like carpet), mine certainly didn’t.”\nThe shade thrown at Mattel, especially from the guy who wrote Back to the Future seems warranted, given that all consumers wanted was something that “will gently glide over most level surfaces,” as the toy’s listing on Mattel’s website boasted.\nThis is kind of funny, given that most efforts to produce an actual, real life hoverboard have proven the task to be nearly impossible and astronomically expensive.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Causes of Poor Service Delivery in Africa and Their Impact ...\") Making sure you're not a bot!\nLoading...\nWhy am I seeing this?\nYou are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites.

It interrogated and critiqued documents on what other researchers in their different contexts had established in view of the feasibility of outsourcing as a strategy to improve service delivery. It emerged in this study that political interference, lack of citizen participation. lack of funds and corruption were the main causes of poor service delivery in local authorities. Therefore, outsourcing was seen to bring quality and affordable services for the public while costs savings and emergence of hidden costs were the financial implications unveiled for the local authorities (LAs). Social costs, accountability for public service delivery and quality shading were cited to be the outsourcing challenges. It also emerged in this study that outsourcing can increase service quality and provide affordable services for the public. Taking into account the information that was accumulated and examined, the researchers came to the conclusion that the current services being offered by local authorities are very poor and this is attributed to many causes such as political interference, lack of citizen participation, lack of funds and corruption. The study therefore, concludes that outsourcing could be a feasible option to use to improve service delivery by local authorities.\nSuggested Citation\nWadesango N & Mhaka C & Chikomo T & Wadesango V O, 2018.\n\"Causes of Poor Service Delivery and the Feasibility of Outsourcing to Improve Services in Local Authorities,\"\nJournal of Economics and Behavioral Studies, AMH International, vol. 10(2), pages 188-198.\nHandle:\nRePEc:rnd:arjebs:v:10:y:2018:i:2:p:188-198\nDOI: 10.22610/jebs.v10i2(J).2228\nDownload full text from publisher\nCorrections\nAll material on this site has been provided by the respective publishers and authors.

From the far-right demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, with their “Blood and Soil” chants and their “Jews will not replace us” placards to attacks on synagogues in Sweden, arson attacks on kosher restaurants in France and a spike in hate crimes against Jews in the UK. Antisemitism seems to have been given a new lease of life.\nThe seemingly endless conflicts in the Middle East have made the problem worse as they spawn divisive domestic politics in the West. But can the advance of antisemitism be attributed to the rise of right-wing populism or the influence of Islamic fundamentalism? One thing is clear. Antisemitism is here and it’s getting worse.\nAntisemitism rears its ugly head in every aspect of public life, whether internal debates within political parties or accusations of conspiratorial networks or plots in politics and business. Or even in the accusations that Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein’s sexually predatory behaviour was somehow linked to his Jewish origins.\nBut by focusing narrowly on the contemporary context of modern antisemitism, we miss a central, if deeply depressing, reality. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic magazine, puts it correctly when he says that what we are seeing is an ancient and deeply embedded hostility towards Jews that is reemerging as the barbarous events of World War II recede from our collective memory.\nGoldberg says that for 70 years, in the shadow of the death camps, antisemitism was culturally, politically and intellectually unacceptable. But now “we are witnessing … the denouement of an unusual epoch in European life, the age of the post-Holocaust Jewish dispensation”. Without an understanding of antisemitism’s ancient roots, the dark significance of this current trend may not be fully understood and hatred may sway popular opinion unchallenged.\nAntisemitism has been called history’s oldest hatred and it has shown itself to be remarkably adaptable. It is carved from – and sustained by – powerful precedents and inherited stereotypes. But it also taking on variant forms to reflect the contingent fears and anxieties of an ever-changing world. Understood this way, it is the modern manifestation of an ancient prejudice – one which some scholars believe stretches back to antiquity and medieval times.\nAncient tradition of hatred\nThe word “antisemitism” was popularised by the German journalist Wilhelm Marr. His polemic, Der Sieg des Judentums über das Germentum (The Victory of Jewry over Germandom), was published in 1879. Outwardly, Marr was a thoroughly secular man of the modern world. He explicitly rejected the groundless but ancient Christian allegations long made against the Jews, such as deicide or that Jews engaged in the ritual murder of Christian children. Instead, he drew on the fashionable theories of the French academic Ernest Renan (who viewed history as a world-shaping contest between Jewish Semites and Aryan Indo-Europeans). Marr suggested that the Jewish threat to Germany was racial. He said that it was born of their immutable and destructive nature, their “tribal peculiarities” and “alien essence”.\nAntisemites like Marr strove for intellectual respectability by denying any connection between their own modern, secular ideology and the irrational, superstitious bigotry of the past. It is a tactic which is employed by some contemporary antisemites who align themselves with “anti-Zionism”, an ideology whose precise definition consequently excites considerable controversy. But this continuing hostility towards Jews from pre-modern to modern times has been manifest to many.\nThe American historian Joshua Trachtenberg, writing during World War II, noted:\nModern so-called ‘scientific’ antisemitism is not an invention of Hitler’s … it has flourished primarily in central and eastern Europe, where medieval ideas and conditions have persisted until this day, and where the medieval conception of the Jew which underlies the prevailing emotional\nDoc 4(Title: \"Why Are Jews Persecuted?\") this information passes it on to at least one other person, the crimes and misdeeds of the Jewish supremacists and Zionists will be exposed.

    "question": "why women are judged for their appearance",
    "agent_answer": "From the information gathered, it appears that women are judged more for their appearance due to several factors:\n\n1. **Cultural Norms and Expectations**: Societies often have higher expectations for women to be attractive and well-groomed. This can lead to a greater focus on physical appearance in social and professional settings.\n\n2. **Media Influence**: Media plays a significant role in shaping perceptions of beauty and attractiveness.

Older people are attractive, as long as their facial expressions communicate life's wisdom, kindness and warmth of character. Remember that an attractive appearance is also the way in which we convey information about ourselves to others, it is not just clothes, accessories, but also our attitude, our behaviour that makes us more attractive for others\" - emphasises Dr. Czernecka.\nQualitative research was conducted among residents of a large city (over 500,000 residents) with secondary and higher education, with a similar economic status. The study was financed by the National Science Centre.\nPAP - Science in Poland\nszu/ ekr/ kap/\ntr. RL\nDoc 3(Title: \"How women’s life-long experiences of being judged by their ...\") ir life experiences have routinely included instances of being looked at.\nEvery time a girl is told she is cute or pretty, or even described in gender-neutral, objective terms such as being tall, she is actually being told she is being looked at and assessed on her appearance. Boys are far more likely to have their behaviour or personality commented on by adults, rather than their appearance - being brave, adventurous or clever.\nEven more insidious is the notion that appearance evaluations genuinely matter in numerous situations. The benefits that attractive women receive include everything from social mobility and college admissions to educational attainment and job offers. Women rated as being unattractive or unfeminine are more negatively evaluated than comparably unattractive men.\nBetter office designs\nGiven that women’s outcomes are, at least in part, determined by their appearance, it is not surprising that, compared to their male colleagues, female workers are comparatively more aware of their visibility.\nResearch suggests we should question the notion that, just because we can see and hear our colleagues, we will have more and better in-person conversations. The communication benefits of increased exposure to others afforded by open-plan space may be overstated, and the downside of being so visible may disproportionately impact women in the workplace.\nThe idea that female and male employees differ in their perceptions of being observed should be acknowledged and incorporated into office design.\nHow? By ensuring that, within open-plan environments, female workers are afforded opportunities for privacy. This includes allowing them to work with their backs to the wall or to be seated away from busy thoroughfares, and by positioning desks so that women are not forced to walk past numerous colleagues on their way to amenities such as the kitchen or the bathroom.\nOr, best of all, allowing people to work remotely (and in total privacy) for at least part of the week.\nDoc 4(Title: \"5 Things Women Are Judged More Harshly For Than Men\") When it comes to gender, double standards are alive and well. Let's face it: despite all of the advances toward gender equality, many people still expect different things from men and women.\nThis is why studies about female breadwinners or advertisements featuring stay-at-home dads are newsworthy, why \"boys will be boys\" is actually still a phrase humans use, and why it's standard for men to catcall women on the street and not vice-versa. These inequalities arguably exist because it's common for people to judge mens' and women's behavior by different standards.\nRedditor blackbirdholiday asked other Reddit users to identify some of the things women are generally judged more harshly for than men.The results made us realize just how much has to change.\nHere are five things Reddit users believe society looks down on women for:\n1. Having \"too many\" sexual partners. While no-one's \"number\" should matter, the sexual double standard is alive and well. Men who sleep around are \"studs,\" but women who do the same are \"sluts.\" What's more, a disturbing study found that women labelled \"promiscuous\" were rejected by their male and female peers, which is all kinds of messed up.\n2. Having a messy home. Though an estimated 81 percent of men and 87 percent of women report feeling anxious about home upkeep, women still do the majority of the housework. Why? Because women are judged much more harshly than men for having a messy home. We like the attitude HuffPost blogger Claire McCarthy shared in her Feb. 25 post: \"We have more important things to do. If there is some time left over after we talk, eat together, play together and finish this really great book, we'll clean. If not, well, it can wait.\"\n3. Being overweight. Though both men and women experience fat prejudice, studies have found that overweight women feel more societal pressure to lose weight than overweight men.\n4. Being blunt or assertive. A woman who speaks her mind too much is deemed bossy, aggressive or arrogant -- whereas a mouthy dude is simply showcasing his executive leadership skills.\n5. Not having children. Childfree women are often referred to as \"selfish\" and told they will regret their decision not to have kids. Because what kind of unnatural woman would never want to be a mother? Men get no such flak -- being a dad isn't considered to be an essential part of manhood. Plus, men have way more time to decide if they want kids! (But they still have biological clocks, too.)\nWhat else do you think women are judged more harshly for? Leave a comment below, or Tweet @HuffPostWomen!\nDoc 5(Title: \"Sociologist: Women judged more by their looks in various ...\") Studies show that while both women and men are aware of the importance of appearance for social functioning, women are judged more by their looks than men in various spheres of life, says sociologist Dr. Julita Czernecka from the University of Lodz.\nThe researcher is a co-author of the book \"Kulturowe koncepcje płci i wieku a postawy kobiet i mężczyzn wobec swego zdrowia i wyglądu\" (\"Cultural concepts of gender and age and the attitudes of women and men towards their health and appearance\"). The publication is based on research carried out at the Institute of Sociology of the University of Lodz by a team of researchers: Ewa Malinowska, Krystyna Dzwonkowska-Godula, Emilia Garncarek, Julita Czernecka and Joanna Brzezińska.\nDr. Czernecka emphasises that at the first impression, facial expressions, gestures, postures, attire, accessories and hairstyle often tell more about a person than verbal messages.\nMany studies on the importance of appearance have been published. Among the more interesting concepts is Catherine Hakim's concept of erotic capital that includes such elements as: the beauty of the face and its symmetry, sexual attractiveness in the context of the whole body, charm and grace, positive energy, as well as dressing style, makeup and hairstyle.\n\"According to this concept, attractive people are those whom others like not only because of their appearance, but also their behaviour; they are sociable, nice, friendly, likeable. As a result, they are generally considered more competent, reliable, it is easier for them to find friends, they are promoted more often and earn more\" - the sociologist explains. Other studies also show that the value of beauty in the labour market and in personal life often overshadows intelligence, education, academic titles, class affiliation or diligence.\nSociologists from the University of Lodz conducted research on attractiveness among women and men in three age categories: young people (20-37 years old); middle-aged (38-62 years old); and elderly (63-80 years old).\nAccording to Dr. Czernecka, both women and men of different ages were aware of the impact of their appearance on their social functioning. Everyone noticed not only the instrumental value of the appearance, but also its autotelic value - the impact of appearance on well-being, self-esteem and confidence.\nResearch shows, however, that the attitudes towards appearance vary between age and sex groups. Women more often notice that they are judged by their appearance in various spheres of life more than men. Young people, regardless of gender, have the highest awareness of the importance of appearance. \"Feminisation of appearance\" can also be observed among young men.\n\"In this age category, caring about appearance and physical attractiveness is no longer a women's domain. But young women still more often and more strongly emphasise that in their case appearance is more important than in the case of men, especially when it comes to professional career\" - notes the researcher.\nMiddle-aged women and men emphasise the importance of appearance especially in the context of personal life and intimate relationships. This is associated with the fact that people in this category enter the so-called secondary matrimonial market.\n\"Middle-aged women emphasize that their appearance is more often evaluated than the appearance of men, which is why they try to maintain a young look. In the case of men, age is not a factor that could disqualify them in any area, including appearance\" - Czernecka says.\nThe biggest differences in opinions about appearance occur in the oldest age group (63-80). According to the sociologist, older men mostly ignore the role of appearance. Women in this group, on the other hand, think that they are judged mainly by their looks.\n\"They have strongly internalised standards of being young and attractive - they express the conviction that in the case of older women, the lack of attractiveness contributes to being +invisible+\" - s\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information gathered, it appears that women are judged more for their appearance due to several factors:\n\n1. **Cultural Norms and Expectations**: Societies often have higher expectations for women to be attractive and well-groomed. This can lead to a greater focus on physical appearance in social and professional settings.\n\n2. **Media Influence**: Media plays a significant role in shaping perceptions of beauty and attractiveness. Women are frequently portrayed in a way that emphasizes their physical appearance, reinforcing societal standards.\n\n3. **Social and Professional Implications**: There is evidence suggesting that women's success and opportunities in certain fields can be influenced by their appearance.

These institutions birthed numerous Protestant denominations, non-Christian movements rooted in the liberation of black people, institutions of higher learning, and more.\nBecause of this immense history, power, and influence despite generations of ill treatment and racism, black churches need to thrive, continuing to speak truth to power and serve black communities beyond the sanctuary.\nAfrican-American clergy have historically played a visible role in the struggle for civil rights. Unique to black churches and clergy is the engagement of transforming community, meeting the needs of their congregations, and truly manifesting the meaning of service.\nCelebrated and noted amongst black clergy is the Rev. Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. Pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ for 36 years. Wright set the precedent for service beyond the sanctuary by establishing Trinity as the epicenter for holistic existence on the South Side of Chicago. They are the incarnate model of being unashamedly black, unapologetically beautiful. It was Wright who boldly professed in his pulpit that LGBTQ lives mattered in the sight of God, and told his congregation that they too are God’s children. His unapologetic witness, love, and inclusivity of all persons enabled him, through black liberation and womanist theologies, to possess a prophetic view that transcended tradition and practice. Wright built more than 60 ministries serving the church and its surrounding community. These included ministries for HIV/AIDS care, drug and alcohol recovery, hospice care, senior citizen health care, housing and child care program, a reading program for the poor, and 22 ministries for youth. This ministry continues today under the leadership of the revered Rev. Dr. Otis Moss, III.\nCurrently, pastors such as Rev. Dr. Delman Coates, senior pastor of Mt. Ennon Baptist Church, a thriving black megachurch in Clinton, Md., are continuing the work of economic empowerment, environmental justice, student debt relief, healthcare, health and wellness, and other issues important to the black community.\n“The black church was born out of the fight for freedom, justice, and equality,” said Coates. “Our voices cannot be silent and must speak truth to power.”\nMost noted is Coates’ founding and organizing of the Our Money Campaign, an issue-based advocacy campaign that seeks to bring Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) into the mainstream in order to solve some of our nation's greatest social and economic challenges.\n“Economic injustice exasperated the issues of race. When economic insecurity is exasperated, all matters of social injustice are too. We have to have a black church that understands economics at the macroeconomic level. The “Our Money Campaign” is to educate faith leaders, public, and others about the role of fiscal policy’s detrimental impact on our community,” said Coates.\nOther leaders have continued to serve the black community tirelessly: Rev. Dr. Howard-John Wesley of Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Va. hosts the largest HBCU College Fair with over 70 colleges and universities. Most recently, they made headlines for their $100,000 gift to cover the outstanding tuition and fee balances of 34 graduating seniors. Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist church is launching a campaign aimed at ending mass incarceration\nDoc 2(Title: \"The history and importance of the Black Church – Harvard ...\") and with enormous effort, they refused to allow that to happen. And the culture they created was sublime, awesome, majestic, lofty, glorious, and at all points subversive of the larger culture of enslavement that sought to destroy their humanity. The miracle of African American survival can be traced directly to the miraculous ways that our ancestors reinvented the religion that their “masters” thought would keep them subservient, Rather, that religion enabled them and their descendants to learn, to grow, to develop, to interpret and reinvent the world in which they were trapped; it enabled them to bide their time — ultimately, time for them to fight for their freedom, and for us to continue the fight for ours. It also gave them the moral authority to turn the mirror of religion back on their masters and to indict the nation for its original sin of allowing their enslavement to build up that “city upon a hill.” In exposing that hypocrisy at the heart of their “Christian” country, they exhorted succeeding generations to close the yawning gap between America’s founding ideals and the reality they had been forced to endure. Who were these people? As the late Rev. Joseph Lowery put it, “I don’t know whether the faith produced them, or if they produced the faith. But they belonged to each other.”\nPublished by arrangement with Penguin Press, a member of Penguin Random House, LLC. Copyright © 2021 by Henry Louis Gates Jr.\nDoc 3(Title: \"\"The Black Church In America \" a story - African American ...\") rican Baptist Church of Savannah, Georgia, began in 1777. This is said to be the oldest Black church in North America. Originally called the First Colored Church, the pastoral life of George Leile’s preaching is tied to its beginning.\nIn 1787, Blacks in Philadelphia organized the Free African Society, the first organized Afro-American society, and Absalom Jones and Richard Allen were elected as overseers. They established contact and created relationships with similar Black groups in other cities. Five years later, the Society began to build a church dedicated to July 17, 1794. The African Church applied for membership in the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The end of the Confederacy signaled freedom for millions of southern Black slaves and prompted the emancipation of the Black church. This started the emergence of the Black church as a separate institution.\nMany Black churches discreetly doubled as stations on the Underground Railroad. At the time, white southerners still sought to maintain control over African Americans' worship for religious and social reasons. Such services typically emphasized the responsibility of the slave to be obedient and provided biblical justification for Black bondage. Slaves had no voice in church affairs and were relegated to the rear of the church or the gallery as spectators rather than full congregation members.\nAfter emancipation, Black churches became virtually the only place for African Americans to find refuge. Blacks moved away from the \"hush harbors\" they retreated to for solace as slaves. During this time, thirty-eight black members of the predominantly white Fairfield Baptist Church in Northumberland County, Virginia, filed a church separation petition in 1867. Referring to the new political and social status of Blacks, the petitioners said they wanted to \"place ourselves where we could best promote our mutual good\" and suggested\" a separate church organization as the best possible way. A month later, the white members of the church unanimously acceded to the petitioners' request, setting the stage for the creation of the all-black Shiloh Baptist Church.\nOnce established, Black churches spread rapidly throughout the South; the Baptist churches led in this proliferation. The 1800s ushered in many millstones built on the Black Church's foundation. To mention just a few, 1808 celebrated the founding of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City. Black Americans and a group of Ethiopian merchants were unwilling to accept racially segregated seating at the First Baptist Church of New York City. They forever withdrew their membership and established themselves in a building on Anthony Street (later Worth Street) called the Abyssinian Baptist Church. The name was inspired by the nation from which the merchants of Ethiopia had come, Abyssinia.\nOther new churches also emerged because of the missionary activities of Black ministers. The Reverend Alexander Bettis, a former South Carolina slave, organized more than forty Baptist churches between 1865 and his death in 1895. Also, in 1881, Canada stretched the church's funds, setting into motion a union between the AMEC and the British Methodist Episcopal Church (BMEC), ratified at a BMEC convention held at Hamilton in June 1881.\nServices: With the division of congregations came a distinct religious observance combining African rituals, slave emotionalism, southern suffering, and individual eloquence. Working-class Baptist and Methodist church services fused African and European forms of religious expression to produce a unique version of worship that reflected the anguish, pain, and occasional joy of nineteenth-century Black life in the United States.\nSuch services usually involved a devotional prayer, a leading church member singing by the congregation and choir, and the minister's sermon. The prayer would request a mighty God to ease the congregation's earthly burden and would be enhanced by the congregation's response, an expression of\nDoc 4(Title: \"\"The Black Church In America \" a story - African American ...\") *This Registry dates from 1758 and briefly describes the history of the Black Church in America. This institution was the first source of land ownership for black African slaves in America and is viewed as the reason and savior of oppressed African people in the United States.\nDuring the decades of southern slavery in America, slave associations were a constant source of concern to slave owners. For many members of white society, Black religious meetings symbolized the ultimate threat to white existence. Nevertheless, African slaves established and relied heavily on their churches. Religion offered a means of catharsis... Africans retained their faith in God and found refuge in their churches. However, white society was not always willing to accept the involvement of slaves in Christianity. As one slave recounted, \"The white folks would come in when the colored people would have a prayer meeting and whip every one of them. Most of them thought that when colored people were praying, it was against them”.\nReligious exercises of slaves were closely watched to detect plans for escape or insurrection. Black churches showed an air of militancy in the eyes of white Americans. Insurrections such as Nat Turner's in Virginia, born out of the religious inspiration of slaves, horrified white Americans. Understanding the potential end that could result from the religious experiences of African slaves, many white Americans opposed the participation of Blacks in Christianity. In African American history, \"the church\" has long been central to black communities. It has become the most significant Black religious enrichment and secular development source.\nThis development is embodied in Christianity, and the term \"the Black Church” presents many details of racial and religious lifestyles unique to Black history. In essence, the term \"the Black Church\" is a misnomer. It implies that all Black churches share the same aspirations and strategies for creating cohesive African American communities. This is untrue; numerous black community differences were reflected within their churches.\nBlack communities differed from region to region. They were divided along social lines, composed of persons from different economic levels, and maintained varying political philosophies. Black communities in the inner cities of the United States have traditionally differed from those in rural areas, etc. In The Negro Church in America, sociologist E. Franklin Frazier noted, \"Methodist and Baptist denominations were separate church organizations based upon distinctions of color and what were considered standards of civilized behavior.\"\nOrganized politically and spiritually, Black churches were not only given to the teachings of Christianity but were faithfully relied upon to address the specific issues that affected their members. For many African American Christians, black Churches have always represented their religion, community, and home regardless of denominational differences. Scholars have repeatedly asserted that Black history and Black church history overlap to be virtually identical. One of the First known Black churches in America was created before the American Revolution, around 1758. Called the African Baptist or \"Bluestone\" Church, this house of worship was founded on the William Byrd plantation near the Bluestone River in Mecklenburg, Virginia. Africans believed that only adult baptism by total immersion was doctrinally correct.\nBlack people in America also supported the autonomy of their congregation in making decisions independent of the larger church bodies. Other early Black Church milestones included the Baptist and Episcopal denominations. The First African Baptist Church of Savannah, Georgia, began in 1777. This is said to be the oldest Black church in North America. Originally called the First Colored Church, the pastoral life of George Leile’s preaching is tied to its beginning.\nIn 1787, Blacks in Philadelphia organized the Free African Societ\nDoc 5(Title: \"5 Reasons Why Many Black Churches Are Failing ...\") ent, but numerous Black churches aren’t giving any time to community service, or they’re devoting an insignificant amount of time to community service. An effective church stays active in the lives of the people in its service area.\n5. Lack of a Social Justice Agenda. The Black Church, as a whole, must return to advocating for social justice as it did during the Civil Rights Movement.

    "question": "why did congress take over reconstruction",
    "agent_answer": "<think> To understand why Congress took over Reconstruction, I need to consider the context of the post-Civil War period in the United States. The Civil War ended in 1865, and initially, President Abraham Lincoln had plans for Reconstruction, but these were largely focused on a lenient approach. However, as the Radical Republicans in Congress gained more influence, they pushed for a more stringent approach to Reconstruction. This shift was partly due to the desire to ensure that former Confederate states would be fully integrated into the Union and to protect the rights of newly freed African Americans.\n\nThe main reasons for Congress taking over Reconstruction included:\n1.

    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo determine what makes an app successful, we need to consider several factors such as user engagement, functionality, design, marketing, and user feedback.

Less is more. Try to make your app as efficient as possible, with the least number of actions possible needed to perform each action. If your app is cluttered and hard to understand, your users will abandon it without a second thought. Make the actions a user has to perform within your app predictable and repetitive. Make your user interface supplement your good user experience with simple navigation.\n- Update It Regularly\nYou need to be able to take in your users’ needs and requests, adapt, iterate, and publish increasingly newer, better versions of your app. If you want to be successful, users need to know that you are constantly trying to make their lives easier. Ongoing maintenance, development, and updates are an integral part of this. Your app should always be up to date and relevant. Feedback tells you what you need to improve, what you need to include, and what you need to do away with.\n- Allow Offline Functionality\nYour users will probably not always be online 100% of the time. They may even come from countries that do not have the kinds of internet speeds you are used to. So do not let your app rely on an internet connection 100% of the time. Your app should function properly even without an internet connection.\n- Niches\nThe best performing and successful apps fall into one of the following niches:\n- Gaming\nAs of 2017, there were over 200 million active mobile phone gamers in the US alone. Almost 30% of every app ever created is a mobile game. These numbers are constantly going up all over the world, which means there is no shortage of demand.\nThe mere act of publishing a gaming app will however not guarantee success. The most successful gaming apps are those that were already established popular games before branching into the app market after their userbase demanded a mobile app adoption. Examples include PUBG and Fortnite.\n- Photo and Video Platforms\nThe apps that succeeded in this space made it because they took almost impossible concepts and ran with them. YouTube and Snapchat became successful apps because they developed businesses around concepts that no one would have imagined would be as big as they were. Plus, they remain true to their original mission statements by not changing their objectives. The only development changes they implement are to help them stay relevant.\n- Social Media and Networking\nThe most successful apps in this space were also pioneers in their industry. Just like photo and video platform apps, social media apps took unique concepts and made it their own. In the end, social media has become such a large part of our lives that it is difficult to imagine what life was before Facebook. These apps succeed because they keep a close eye on the behavior of their users, pick lessons from what they learn, and design solutions to meet these needs.\n- Navigation and Productivity Apps\nThe most successful apps in this niche were already established players before branching off into the app market. Apps such as Google Maps and Gmail already existed in other forms before adopting mobile app forms. They established their stake and made their users believe they cannot live without them, building an unshakable trust with their userbase.\n- Utility Apps\nThese types of apps usually owe their success to how they are handled very early on in their existence. If a utility app gets the right kind of marketing and publicity and an audience that is influential or an audience that will endorse the app to others, the app will gain momentum. This means the success of utility apps can be influenced by social media endorsements and word of mouth. The best example of a successful app in this space is Bitmoji.\nThese are just some of the strategies you can employ as you come up with your app. Do not forget to constantly test your app and to provide a feedback channel for your users to get in touch with you.\nDoc 2(Title: \"10 Successful Apps & How They Did It | Creative27\") edia endorsements and word of mouth.

Also, if possible, offer your app for free with strategic freemiums inside, because everyone loves free stuff.\nThe mobile app market is versatile, and nothing is straightforward. Its landscape changes quickly, and you have to figure out how to keep up with the trends. Your concept, target audience and how you market your app will have a direct relationship with how successful your app will be in the long run.\nDoc 3(Title: \"10 Tips From The Best Entrepreneurs To Create A Successful App\") s numerous revisions and incorporations of new features on the basis of user feedback to deliver what the users want. How do you figure out what is working and what isn’t in the mobile app? This is where mobile app analytics comes into the picture.\nAnalytics helps you keep track of app downloads and collects useful metrics regarding the app performance and user engagement with the app.\nYou can get to know the areas where the maximum user interaction takes place within the app, whether some areas are experiencing issues and are loading slower than the rest and whether the overall app functionality is as good as expected.\nIdentify the areas of deficit and work on improving upon them in the future updates to ensure utmost user satisfaction and customer retention.\n10. Ensuring user engagement\nYou mobile app managed to get the attention it deserved and you got rewarded with a number of downloads. Contrary to the other fields, in the mobile app space, this isn’t what triumph looks like. It’s merely the beginning.\nThe actual victory is managing to keep the user engagement high by providing constant value. The app users should not end up uninstalling the app due to lack of engagement.\nHow do you keep the users engaged? Glad you asked! The secret to user engagement lies in the basics of human psychology. Keep giving them incentives to keep them hooked to your product.\n“Having rewards in mobile apps increases user retention and app favorability. We have a study to prove it!”, says Brian Wong, the founder of Kiip and once the youngest person ever to receive venture capital funding.\nFocus on providing true value to the customers constantly and incessantly and you have the recipe for a successful mobile app on your hands.\nDoc 4(Title: \"10 Successful Apps & How They Did It | Creative27\") As of the year 2017, there were over 6 million apps in existence. With all these apps out there, it is increasingly difficult to stand out from the crowd and get noticed by potential users. In order to make it in this space, one of the most fundamental steps one can take is to study what has worked for other successful apps and implement these lessons in their own apps.\nApps are fast becoming a more and more important part of our daily lives. Mobile has become a tool that shapes our society today. We get our news, shop and interact with one another using our phones, and it is mobile apps that make all these feats possible. According to a study carried out by Flurry, users spend about 90% of their phone time on mobile apps compared to browsing websites. Companies and businesses have found out about this power, and theyâre clamoring to get a piece of the action. More and more apps are being created and released every day, all trying to cater to the needs of consumers as well as they can.\nLetâs take a peek at the current Apple App Store top 10 to see what makes up a successful app.\n- PUBG Mobile (Games)\n- Fortnite (Games)\n- YouTube (Photo & Video)\n- Snapchat (Photo & Video)\n- Instagram (Photo & Video)\n- Messenger (Social Networking)\n- Google Maps (Navigation)\n- Facebook (Social Networking)\n- Bitmoji (Utilities)\n- Gmail (Productivity)\nSo what goes into coming up with a successful app? A quick look at any app store’s list of the best performing apps will reveal the answer to this question. There are a few striking similarities between these apps, and it is these factors that this article will focus on. Here is a look at the strategies one has to adapt when coming up with an app built for success from day one. What do successful apps do?\n- Successful Apps Solve Problems\nIdentify your users’ needs and work towards making their lives easier. Make them believe they cannot live without your app and you will have created something special. Think big. Do your research thoroughly. If you cannot come up with something entirely original, pick a competitor and create a better version of their concept. Do not blindly imitate, because this is the fastest route to failure. Make your app relevant to your users’ lives and they will thank you for it.\n- Be Unique\nWhat do you have to offer that is not already being offered by hundreds of other similar apps? Give your customers value for the time they invest in your app and they will be loyal to you. What do you have to offer? Is it entertainment, utility or convenience? You should also make sure to do some thorough research on the ideas you have to ensure that the final product you get does what you intend it to do.\n- Think iOS and Android\nThese are the two most popular mobile platforms in the world today. By cutting out one platform, you are essentially shutting out roughly half your potential user base. Initiate a cross-platform app development framework from as early in your design process as possible. Doing this will save you the headache that comes with having to develop two separate app versions for two separate platforms.\n- Choose A Core Feature and Focus on That\nLet your app do just one thing, and let it do that one thing really well. Do not pile unnecessary features on top of one another. This will only take away from your users’ experience and it is a definite recipe for disaster. Plus, if you focus all your energies on one thing, you can deliver exactly what your users want and know you did it as best as you could. Pick an action and perform it better than anyone else, and your app will become the go-to app for that specific activity. If users ask for more, give in to their demands in later versions, but always cater to their needs.\n- Simplicity Is The Ultimate Sophistication\nKeep your app clean and simple. Less is more. Try to make your app as efficient as possible, with the least number of actions possible needed to perform each action. If your app is cluttered and hard to understand, yo\nDoc 5(Title: \"Eight Tips For A Successful App - Forbes\") nto the core functionality of the app, so each user that enjoys the app can potentially attract a network of new users. It means the app is better or more engaging when users invite friends to use it. Consider Instagram and WhatsApp: Both apps are only fun if users can get their friends to use them, too.\n3. Don’t Forget Android\nFor most of us, the iPhone was our introduction to the smartphone and apps ecosystem, but Android is now the dominant platform with over 50 percent market share in most markets. Start with the iPhone, but Android must be part of your roadmap.\n4. Consider Small Markets\nEveryone wants to crack the Top 10 in the US market, but sometimes it’s easier to start in smaller markets in Latin America or Asia. The volume of installs you need to get to the Top 25 in the US is about 30 times higher than in a country like Mexico and CPIs are also cheaper.\n5. Marketing Is Key…\nMake sure you budget for app promotion. It’s essential to attract a first batch of users to test metrics and understand the real value of each user before continuing with more systematic campaigns.\n6. …But Leave It To The Experts\nIn contrast to what happens on the web, mobile traffic and marketing providers are highly fragmented and it can be very challenging to accurately measure what you are buying. Diego recommends paying CPI (Cost Per Install) only and ensuring that a healthy share of what you buy is not incentivized.\n7. Track and Measure EVERYTHING\nUse tracking tools to measure what happens inside the app (what are people clicking and using), your traffic sources and which sources bring in the best users.\n8. Make It Free\nFor potential app users, there is a GIGANTIC difference between $0.00 and $0.99. You can monetize your app with in-app purchases, but to exponentially increase the odds of someone giving your app a try, just use the magic word: free.\nApp development isn’t easy, but it is key to building a sustainable online business across all platforms. Diego’s advice, can help you crack the elusive Top 10. But you’ll have to come up with your own brilliant idea – iFart is already taken.\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information gathered, here are the key factors that make an app successful:\n\n1. **Simplicity**: An app should be clean, simple, and easy to use. It should require minimal actions to perform tasks.\n\n2. **Regular Updates**: Continuous improvement and updates are necessary to keep the app relevant and to address user feedback.\n\n3. **Offline Functionality**: The app should function well even without an internet connection.\n\n4. **Target Audience**: Identifying and catering to a specific target audience is crucial.

    "question": "does behavior modification work for elderly",
    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, behavior modification techniques like applied behavior analysis (ABA) can be effective in managing behavior issues in elderly individuals. ABA involves understanding the functional relationship between behavior and the environment and using reinforcers to encourage positive behaviors and discourage negative ones.

However, the implementation needs to be done correctly, and it may require additional staff or specialists to ensure the approach is effective and does not overburden existing nursing staff.\n\n<answer> Yes, behavior modification techniques, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), can work effectively for managing behavior issues in elderly individuals. </answer>",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> Behavior modification techniques involve changing behaviors through reinforcement or punishment.

Is it asking too much for nurses in long-term care settings to have these responsibilities while delivering nursing care? Is there a more cost-effective way?\nApplied behavior analysis (ABA) is a process by which behavior is viewed as having a functional relationship to the environment. Why a patient exhibits a particular behavior is viewed as an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Behaviorists look at antecedents, consequences, and general settings associated with certain behaviors. As a result, they are often able to provide a system of reinforcers—i.e., tokens, praise, and other rewards—that encourage acceptable behavior and discourage—eliminate, if possible—troublesome behaviors. Applied behavioral analysts, also known as ABA therapists, are specialists in behavior management.\nSeveral nursing homes are now bringing\napplied behavior analysis into their facilities to aid patient management. While nursing often looks at the behavioral issues of dementia and other mental disorders as part of the disease process, ABA therapists view such behaviors as an interaction between the patient and his or her environment. Accordingly, they seek to help staff manage patient behaviors by designing environments that are more conducive to behavioral control, identifying antecedents to behavior issues, and designing a system of reinforcers that is better able to influence behavior.\nFacilities for head-injured patients have used ABA for years with success. In most of these facilities, as behavioral specialists and aides have focused on managing behavior issues, nurses have been able to focus their attention on delivering nursing care.\nThis model could also be successful in many nursing homes, but it must be implemented correctly. Some hire an ABA therapist as a consultant and then expect nursing to carry out the behavioral plans. This approach often is ineffective because expecting nurses and certified nurse’s aides to document behavior and carry out interventions, in addition to other duties, is asking too much.\nI am not in favor of reducing nurse staffing levels, but having a few behavioral aides to complement nursing staff might allow for more effective use of the staff. It is my hope that this model is adopted so nursing can provide the care that patients in long-term care facilities need but don’t get, often because of having to constantly deal with interruptions caused by behavior issues.\nMichael C.

She has been pulling her hair out and now has several bald patches. Attempts to stop her from giving in to the urge have been futile. Telling her to stop has yielded only short-term success, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and anxiety medication have not worked.\nKen, a 47-year-old patient with dementia and blindness, impulsively gets out of his chair and walks forward, at times walking into other residents and walls. Because he is a risk to himself and others, he is placed near the nurses’ station so they can quickly redirect him back to his chair when needed. He gets angry when frequently told to sit down. Medication has not slowed him down but has increased his risk of falling.\nBruce, a chronic paranoid schizophrenic patient, is addicted to cigarettes. In his facility, smokers are taken to the patio four times a day to smoke. Bruce often tries to smoke as many cigarettes as he can in the 20-minute time allotment and occasionally damages the tips of his fingers by smoking cigarette butts until there is virtually nothing left of them. Other times, he refuses to come back inside until he has completed smoking his last cigarette. A few times, he has become aggressive when someone attempts to end his smoking. This has become a daily ritual that is quite time-consuming for members of the nursing staff.\nA nursing problem, by default\nThese are just three examples of behavior issues that take caregivers’ time in long-term settings. Other behavior problems include yelling, wandering, sexually inappropriate behaviors, and hoarding, to name a few. These issues often become the domain of nursing-staff members who are there to deliver nursing care and are not specifically trained for behavior management. Many patients with these issues are referred for psychiatric evaluations but, unfortunately, there is no pharmacological treatment for the majority of DSM-5 diagnoses and\nno FDA-indicated medication for these behaviors.\nMany behaviors seen in long-term care seem to have no purpose or easily determined cause. Often, patients have cognitive deficits or mental illnesses that make insight-directed counseling impossible. Sometimes, a nurse can determine through trial and error why a patient is uncomfortable or agitated, but the vast majority of causes or behavior triggers are undetermined.\nNo simple solutions\nStaff members have tried to end Ellen’s hair pulling by having her wear a hat or hairnet. She takes them off. Mittens were suggested, but they are viewed as a form of restraint and not allowed.\nKen disrupts nursing duties with his constant getting up and needing to be redirected. At times, a one-to-one special—assigning one staff person to stay with the patient at all times—is used, but administration regards this as a too-costly solution. Activities help keep him still for short periods but can’t compete with his constant attempts to wander. A\nmerry walker was suggested to allow Ken to wander freely without bumping into walls and injuring himself, but administration views this as a form of physical restraint and does not allow it.\nBruce has been sent to the emergency room a few times when he responded in a threatening manner to efforts to interrupt his smoking, but he was immediately sent back to the nursing home, because his actions were not seen as a danger to others or evidence of a true psychiatric issue. At times, he has been kept inside and not allowed to smoke, which has only increased his anger and paranoia.\nApplied behavior analysis\nWhat can be done to help nurses better manage issues such as these? Is it asking too much for nurses in long-term care settings to have these responsibilities while delivering nursing care? Is there a more cost-effective way?\nApplied behavior analysis (ABA) is a process by which behavior is viewed as having a functional relations\nDoc 4(Title: \"Elderly Behavior Change: Caregiving Information - AgingCare\") Are you sure you want to exit?

    "question": "how do native americans view death",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information provided, Native Americans generally view death not as an end but as a transition or continuation of life. Many Native American cultures perceive time as circular rather than linear, meaning that death is seen as a natural part of the cycle of life and not as an ending. This belief often includes concepts such as reincarnation or the soul joining ancestors in the next world. Therefore, death is often met with acceptance and sometimes even celebration, rather than grief.",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think>\nTo answer this question accurately, I need to consider the diverse beliefs and traditions of Native American tribes across North America, as there is not one unified view on death among all Native American cultures.\n</think>\n\n<search>Native American views on death and afterlife </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Native American Beliefs About Time and Death - SevenPonds ...\") In the Western world, most people perceive time as a linear thing. Milestones are anticipated, passed, and once they are passed, they are finished. We are born, we live and we die. In that order. And once we die, we are gone. But not all cultures agree. Many Native American cultures perceive time as being circular, rather than linear. There are no definite beginnings or endings, only what is, what always has been, and what always will be.\nWhat if death isn’t the end, but simply another milestone on the timeline of life? Rather than imagining life as a line, what if we imagined it as a spiral? Many Native American tribes do not see death as an absolute, but instead they see life as an infinite journey where death is not the end. Death is appreciated as a passage to the next world: the next step in life.\nAlthough there are several hundred different Native American tribes, many of which have different beliefs, almost all tribes hold this perception of time as being circular. Many tribes believe in reincarnation, and that the soul is an eternal presence that moves from body to body without ever leaving the world. Others believe that when a loved one dies, their soul is transported to the next world where they join their ancestors who passed before them. This different perspective allows the Native American people to view death not with grief, but with acceptance and happiness. Moving from this world to the next is not something to be mourned, but rather it is something to be celebrated. Death is nothing more than a stepping stone to the next life.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Christianity Comes to the Americas | Christian History ...\") First “Americans”\nWho: Peoples from NE Asia\nWhen: According to many scholars, they crossed the Bering Strait about 12,000 years ago (though scattered signs of human life predate that).\nWhere: By 9000 years ago, distinct groups were spread from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Examples of those before or at the time of Columbus: the Carib (Caribbean islands and Central America), the Nasca and Moche (Peru), the Araucanians (Chile), Guarani (Brazil and Paraguay), and the Toltecs (Mesoamerica).\nMaya\nWhere: Mesoamerica (Central Mexico to Nicaragua)\nWhen: Dominant for hundreds of years; golden era ended around A.D. 900.\nCulture: Agricultural experts; life centered on corn as both staff of life and god. Skilled in astronomy, the arts, warfare, and math (they used the concept of zero 1,000 years before Europe). Complex writing system.\nReligion: Highly important; rituals involved blood sacrifice.\nEncounter: Already weakened, could not significantly oppose Spanish.\nAztec\nWhere: Mesoamerica\nWhen: Zenith by the 1300s.\nCulture: Capital, Tenochtitlán (Mexico City), much larger than London in 1519. Violent and highly organized. The “Romans” of the New World.\nReligion: Highest offering to gods (corn god was central) was human heart. Motecuhzoma II’s (Montezuma II’s) crowning in 1502 required sacrifice of 5,000 people; dedication of great temple 20,000 people.\nEncounter: Spaniards’ smallpox and numerous wars with Cortés and native allies decimated them.\nInca\nWhere: Empire stretched 2,500 miles from Ecuador to Chile, larger than Roman Empire. 12 million people. Capital in Cuzco— “the center of the universe”—with secondary capital in Quito.\nWhen: 1400s and early 1500s.\nCulture: 18,000 miles of paved roads. City of Machu Picchu boasted 100 acres of temples, plazas, barracks, and houses. All land held by emperor in trust for people. Communication in quipu, complex bundles of colored and knotted string.\nReligion: Sun god above all.\nEncounter: Their gold and silver seduced Pizarro, who, aided by smallpox and civil wars, conquered the empire.\nChurch’s Impact\n•Spanish culture: Charles I, king of Spain, prohibited non-Spanish clergy from going to the Americas. So Latin America became marked by the unique qualities of Spanish Catholicism.\n•Depopulation: Spanish expansion into the Americas caused rapid depopulation. Some scholars estimate that when Columbus arrived, there were 44,000,000 native Americans. Just 150 years later, there were only 5,600,000. What caused the dramatic drop? European diseases (such as smallpox), wars and slaughters, and forced labor or slavery. Many Christians did, however, speak out against the atrocities and try to alleviate the natives’ sufferings.\n•Schools and hospitals: By 1820, there were 25 universities and 56 secondary schools, most started and run by monastic orders, as well as numerous hospitals.\n•Church and state: Church and state were united and controlled all facets of life. By 1805 Alexander von Humboldt estimated that in some provinces of Mexico the church directly or indirectly controlled 80 percent of the land.\n•Hierarchical society: Society was stratified with the Spanish-born Peninsulares at the top; their American-born children (Creoles) next, the “mixed-blood” mestizos next; the Indians and black slaves at the bottom. Church leadership drew mainly from the top tiers.\n•Church orientation: 500 years after the first Christian contact, the region is a strong Catholic center, with increasing numbers of Protestants.\nFirst Christian Missionaries\n•Who: Bernal Buyl, vicar apostolate and representative of Ferdinand and Isabella, and 12 other churchmen.\n•When: Columbus’s second voyage.

The idea that North American Indians had a democratic culture is several decades old, but not usually expressed within historical literature. The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by Benjamin Franklin and a speech by the Iroquois chief Canassatego in 1744. Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of a confederation, and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that eighteenth century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance.[114]\nWhat little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council, and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary. The council itself did not practice representative government, and there were no elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the clan. Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous, with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe. Tooker concludes that \"...there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois\" and that the myth is largely based on a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer J.N.B. Hewitt which was exaggerated and misinterpreted after his death in 1937.[114] [undue weight? – discuss]\nThe Aztecs also practiced elections, but the elected officials elected a supreme speaker, not a ruler.[113] However, a contemporary civilisation, Tlaxcallan, along with other Mesoamerican city states, are likely to have practiced collective rule.[115]\nRise of democracy in modern national governments\n[edit]Early Modern Era milestones\n[edit]- Golden Liberty or the Nobles' Democracy (Rzeczpospolita Szlachecka) arose in the Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Within this stage, sentence unpacking helps students examine individual sentences for language features and structure so that they are able to replicate these types of sentences in their own writing.\nThe students huddle together around an excerpt from Dreams on Wheels: “Birds That Can’t Fly, Part 1: The Penguin,” which Sarah has written on chart paper. Sarah starts by chorally reading the following sentences with the students:\nAfter 65 days, the egg hatches. The mother comes back from the sea with food inside her for the chick. The chick puts its bill into the mother’s bill to get the food, which she spits up.\nShe asks the students, “What makes these sentences tricky to understand?” The students discuss their ideas with a partner and Sarah learns they are not sure about the meaning of “hatches.” Together, they define the word “hatches” using the context clue “egg,” and then acting it out with their hands. Sarah cups one hand and then wriggles the finger of the other hand through the cupped hand to mimic a chick hatching from an egg. Not surprisingly, some students are also wondering about the second sentence:\n“How does the mom come [back] from the sea with food inside her?” One student points to her own back, knitting her eyebrows together, asking, “back?” Realizing that this word has multiple meanings, other students are quick to jump in and explain, “No. It means go back or return.” Sarah writes “return” above the word “back” and sketches a return arrow in the margin. The students excitedly exclaim that they know a symbol at the end of the sentence that is called a “decimal” in math; they struggle for a few moments to remember it is also called a “period.” Sarah jots down “decimal in math” and the word “period” beside this punctuation mark.

Next, Sarah helps them explore the similarities and differences between ostriches and penguins and they jointly construct their own text within the explanatory text genre.\nStage 3 of the TLC: “Jointly Constructing Texts”\nSarah focuses on analyzing and evaluating writing in a variety of genres so that she may be more explicit in teaching students the power of codes within the English language.\nAfter building the necessary background knowledge, exploring the language of the explanatory text type, jointly constructing paragraphs comparing penguins and ostriches, the students begin Stage 4 as they are finally ready to construct their own texts independent of the teacher.\nStage 4 of the TLC: “Independently Constructing Texts”\nFinally, Sarah closes out the bird unit with Stage 5 of the TLC: “Reflecting on One’s Writing” in which the students use success criteria to give input and provide feedback to peers to revise their writing.\nIn our work, Sarah and I have realized that by deconstructing and reconstructing text, we demystify the writing process, as we teach the purpose, text structure, and language features specific to different genres.\nThe goal of SIPPS Plus is for students to become fluent readers as efficiently as possible so they can concentrate on comprehending academic content. The TLC complements SIPPS, providing abundant encouragement for students to think, talk, and write as they develop content knowledge.

We are literally “eating our way to extinction”. The meat industry is not only damaging farmed animals, but also wild ones – and especially the ones in danger of extinction. Studies warn that meat-eaters are actually speeding worldwide animals extinction.\nBy killing them, we are killing ourselves\nOur appetite for beef, for dairy, for fish is wiping out animals, and even threatening our own survival.\n“You eat a steak, you kill a lemur in Madagascar. You eat a chicken, you kill an Amazonian parrot”, says geophysicist expert Gidon Eshel, in order to make people realise the full impact of meat consumption on biodiversity.\nBeef, dairy, and fishing industries are today the leading cause of extinction. This also connects to the loss of habitat due to land clearing, but also overfishing and pollution.\nFirst, the vast majority of land clearing is to graze cattle for the meat industry, and to raise crops to feed farmed animals. Can you imagine that currently almost one-third of our planet’s surface is used for these purposes alone, and that this trend is even increasing? This is crazy. Almost 80% of former Amazon forests are now used for grazing cattle for meat.\nBy doing this, we are not only destroying the natural habitat of countless animals, but we are also destroying the ‘lungs of the Earth’, and as a consequence our own life.\nFor what concerns fishing, the greatest extinction danger is over-exploitation: in other words, we are fishing them to extinction in order to satisfy our needs.\nIn addition, many experts have explored the links between modern livestock production and other issues such as climate change and pollution; which eventually lead to animal extinction. For example, animal agriculture is responsible for almost 15% of climate emissions on a world scale, more than all the cars, trains, and planes.\nMeat-eaters are supporting the unsustainable production practices of the meat industry, and as a consequences they are speeding worldwide species extinction rate. We must change the way we eat and produce ‘food’: the current situation is having a catastrophic impact on almost all animal species across the globe.\nEvery meal counts\nBy eating less meat – whether one day a week or one meal a day – you will lower your dietary carbon footprint and take a step to protect wildlife.\nIf you change your eating habits, you will change the agricultural food market. This will result in more sustainable industries – because the meat demand-supply relation will be changed forever. It is simple: if you don’t demand, they won’t produce.\nA plant-based diet (or at least a diet which involves reducing the amount of meat and fish you eat) is one of the easiest, yet stronger ways, to use our planet’s resources more responsibly, and protect animals at the same time. In addition, plant-based food uses less water, have a lower impact on the environment, and guess what…it’s delicious.\nSo why don’t you save a Lemur and a Parrot today?!\n5. Spread Awareness: get involved\nTell the world! Let’s Stop the sixth mass extinction.\nTalk to your family and friends. If you can’t convince them to change their habits, at least try to warn them, and make them more aware of their actions. Start by spreading the advantages of buying eco-friendly products, of eating less meat, and of buying souvenir-greeting-cards when on holiday!\nLast but not least, be a voice for endangered species on social media: share posts, reels, tag your followers. Social media are also a great way of getting informed, and eventually, take more direct action. Stand for animals! together we can stop animal extinction.\nIn a nutshell: the next endangered species is literally us\nMass extinction seems a long way away, but actually, it is just around the corner. And even if you don’t care about endangered species, and you don’t love animals (which is basically impossible) this is not an excuse to sit back and watch. You still must act. In fact, if endangered species actually become extinct, many se\nDoc 5(Title: \"Dairy Farming: The Truth About Consuming Milk and Cheese\") ed to enter the parlor with treats at every milking and are outfitted with a special collar that records the last time they were milked to prevent them from going in too soon.\nDairy products can be found gracing tables around the world, but the consequences of dairy farming often go unnoticed. And the consequences are serious, both for us and the cows.\nCows that are actively lactating, or producing milk, are housed in barns. The types of housing vary. Some cows are kept in tie stalls in which they are tied by their neck into one small space. Others are housed in free stalls that allow them to move from the stall to the alley and interact more easily with each other.\nWhile female calves are often raised to replace their mothers when the older cows are sent to slaughter, male calves are unable to produce milk. Because of this, the most common outcome for them is being slaughtered for veal, often after a short life during which their nutritional needs are deliberately left unmet and their movement is restricted to achieve more desirable qualities in their meat.\nManipulating the estrus cycle is common practice in the dairy industry to make a herd all come into heat at the same time so that farmers are able to synchronize their herds.\nDairy milk produces far more greenhouse gas emissions than alternatives. Milk from cows produces 3.15 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2)-equivalent gases per liter, whereas rice milk, the second worst option, releases just 1.18 kilograms of CO2-equivalent gases per liter.\nThe mother cows in the dairy industry produce milk for ten months out of every year, during the productive period of their lives. The remaining two months of the year are considered dry. The process of drying off is very painful for cows, because they typically experience engorgement of their mammary glands. The engorgement is especially severe for high-production cows.\nThe average dairy cow produces 82 pounds of manure every single day. Multiply that by the mean farm size of 1,300 cows in the United States, and you can estimate that more than 100,000 pounds of manure are produced per day. Nutrients from the manure oversaturate the ground and surrounding grasses, leading to runoff into surrounding waterways and seepage into groundwater.\nGiving dairy cows bovine somatotropin (bST) to increase milk production for 8 of the 10 months that they are lactating is common practice in the U.S. The hormonal drug is available for over-the-counter use, meaning that its use does not need to be overseen by a veterinarian.\nThough animal welfare scientists tout various ways to improve the welfare of the cows on dairy farms, such as using pain management when performing medical procedures like castration or dehorning, the reality of dairy farming remains the same: cows are repeatedly impregnated to maximize milk production, and separated from their babies shortly after birth.\nDairy farming is practiced around the world. However, in most countries in the Global South, animals raised for dairy production are maintained by households that use them both to supplement their own diets and as a source of income, selling milk to their communities.\nThough they are not the top producers of dairy, France, Switzerland and Italy are known for their cheese. The country that produces the most dairy is India, followed by the U.S. Interestingly, half of India’s dairy production comes from buffalo and not cattle.\nIn 2017 there were just over 50,000 dairy farms in the United States. The number of dairy farms in the U.S. has fallen consistently for the last several decades, even though milk production continues to rise. Meanwhile, the median size of a dairy farm has gone up considerably from 80 cows in 1987 to 1,300 cows in 2017.\nThe price that farmers can expect to make from their milk is, in itself, extremely complicated. Market price for milk is determined by a range of factors, including guidelines set by the government and the intended use of the milk, as well as sup\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it appears that the pigs in Animal Farm alter reality to handle the food crisis by manipulating the truth and rewriting history.

Let's start with the printing press, electricity, automobiles, and personal computers.\n\n1. The printing press (invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440) allowed for the mass production of books, making knowledge more accessible.\n2. Electricity transformed daily life, providing light, power for machines, and enabling communication through telephones and later the internet.\n3.

A few centuries ago people could only communicate long distances through writing letters, which could take ages to be delivered. And in the case of emergencies or confidential information, writing letters really wasn’t an effective way of communicating.\nSo, one of the main reasons that I believe that the telephone has changed people’s lives is simply by making communication between people so much faster, easier and more convenient than ever before. These days when you need to get in contact with somebody, all you need to do is pick up your phone, dial a few numbers and wait for them to answer. And if they don’t answer, then you can usually just leave a voice message for them to let them know what it is you wanted to tell them.\nFurthermore, I believe that communication is at the core of social development, and I think that the advent of the telephone has made a great contribution to this area of life.\nSo, whether the information is urgent, confidential, or even down right unnecessary, I think that the telephone has made a massive difference to people’s lives and our societies as well.\nVocabulary highlights:\n1. revolutionary creation – something that made a big difference in people’s lives\n2. the father of – the inventor or creator of something\n3. trial and error – trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes\n4. exaggeration – to over-state something, to say it is better or worse than it really is\n5. devised – planned or invented\n6. take ages – take a long time\n7. confidential – secret\n8. to get in contact with somebody – to contact someone by mail, email, message or phone\n9. at the core of – at the centre of\n10. advent – the arrival or beginning of something\n11. a great contribution – a big help\n12. down right – absolutely or completely\nDoc 2(Title: \"What Causes Change in an Organization? 10 Factors Explored\") ires strength, vision, and a tremendous amount of hard work.\n6) Competitive innovation\nCompetitive innovation forces companies to change. When a competitive company innovate something or do something which can be dangerous for your product then to meet the competition you need to make changes in your strategies and produce a product which is either equivalent to the product of your competitors or has something new which can attract customers.\nCompetitive innovation has been seen in the present times in smartphones companies. Apple is considered a leader of smartphones company, and it has been known for introducing the most innovative products in the market.\nOther smartphone companies like Google, Samsung, OnePlus copies ideas from Apple with their personal touch to stay in the competition.\nIt seems that at present, all the companies have reached a saturation point of innovation which was apparent from the launch of Apple’ iPhone 11.\nEven though the latest iPhones of Apple are full of improved feature, but it has not introduced anything out of the box like it was known for in the times of Steve Jobs.\nCompetitive innovation is both good and bad for the companies as it keeps a company on its toes to stay ahead of competitors and at the same time, it causes stress in the employees and management to come up with innovative ideas frequently.\n7) Cost Cutting\nCost-cutting is also a factor that causes a change in an organization. Companies are forced to cut the cost of its products when a competitor company introduces a product with similar features but at lower prices.\nPrice is a factor which influences the buying decision of customers. Either you are too confident of your products like Apple, or you are required to cut cost according to your competitors in order to stay in the market.\n8) Merger and acquisition\nMerger and acquisition also a factor that causes a change in an organization. The merger means when two companies come together to work. When a merger happens, companies are required to change their structures to adapt to the work environment of one another.\nSimilarly, when a company acquires a new company, it is required to cut cost from some of its operations in order to invest in new products and services or for the development of the acquired company.\nThis is an internal change that an organization makes on its own and not forced by any external changes like we have discussed before in the article.\nThe organization might reduce staff to keep employees acquired with a new organization or changes the nature of jobs of some employees to manage both the companies effectively.\n9) Change in the business structure\nAnother internal factor which causes a change in an organization is the change in the business structure. Like I have mentioned at the beginning of the article is that change is inevitable.\nManagement is required to change in the business structure to adapt to new technologies or in order to enhance the productivity of the organization.\nThink of times when computers were introduced in the organization and organizations are required to change from bookkeeping to maintaining accounts in computers. Employees were provided with training and hiring was made to acquire employees to meet the requirements of new technologies.\nSimilarly, in the present times, too, the structure of the organization changed when they were needed to take their business online to meet the current demand of the customers.\n10) End-of-life of products\nMarket changes, and with that, the need for products also changes. There are some products which stay in demand up to a certain time, and slowly their need diminishes from the market.\nAt that point, the company is required to think of some innovative ideas to produce new products so that they can stay relevant in the market.\nFor example, a few years ago mobile companies were producing mobile phones with keypad, but when touch screen mobile phones were introduced in the market, the value of keypad phones re\nDoc 3(Title: \"3 Major Ways Data Science is Changing the World Today\") e as it appears:\nWe make the world a better place (for everyone)\nWe all remember that last line in action movies where the main bad guy confesses all his wrongdoings were actually acts of goodwill and a loving heart. A part where he says his mega-neutrino bomb was secretly a saving vaccine “against humanity as the planet’s worst virus’. As in we humans suck and everything we touch turns to dust. But as it turned out, in the real world we humans are actually the good guys.\nNot only we collectively treat our planet better each year, but we also use our best minds, resources and efforts to protect it. Three industry leaders – Environmental Defense Fund, California Air Resources Board and Plant Labs – are currently working on the conjoint reporting platform, that by launching two satellites into space aims to track the present situation and any occurring climate change squarely.\nLikewise, governments and city officials are using data patterns to allocate resources more wisely in regards to traffic routes, street lights, water supply and other utilities. The ubiquitous rise of smart homes, solar power, and multilateral recycling helps developed countries to decrease energy consumption and increase their efficiency.\nThere’s even a yearly “Data Science for Social Good” event hosted by the same-name fellowship, where data scientists from all over the world get together to help mother nature and “tackle the problems that really matter”.\nConclusion\nIt turns out data matters are inextricably linked to our modern-day progress and the whole purpose of data science is to propel that progress deeper and further.

Stigma: Unemployment brings more than just ‘no work’. It also brings with it the disgrace that the person has to bear. Nobody likes to be termed as unemployed.\n11. Standard of living: In times of unemployment, the competition for jobs and the negotiation power of the individual decreases, and thus also the living standard of people with reduced salary packages and income.\n12. Employment gaps: To further complicate the situation, the longer the individual is out of a job, the more difficult it becomes to find one.\nEmployers find employment gaps a negative aspect. No one wants to hire a person who has been out of work for some time, even when there’s no fault of the individual per se.\n13. Loss of skills’ usage: The unemployed are not able to put their skills to use. And in a situation where it goes on for too long, the person may have to lose some of his/her skills.\nSocial and Psychological Impacts of Unemployment\nApart from the economic consequences, unemployment also has significant social and psychological impacts on individuals and society as a whole.\nHere are some additional effects worth considering:\n1. Social isolation:\nUnemployment can lead to social isolation as individuals may withdraw from social interactions due to feelings of shame, embarrassment, or the inability to participate in activities that require financial resources.\nThis isolation can have detrimental effects on mental health and overall well-being.\n2. Strained relationships:\nFinancial strain and the stress associated with unemployment can strain relationships with family, friends, and partners.\nThe inability to contribute financially and fulfill social roles may lead to conflicts and strained dynamics within households.\n3. Skill deterioration:\nLong-term unemployment can result in a loss of skills and knowledge.\nWithout opportunities to utilize and enhance their skills, individuals may experience a decline in their professional abilities, making it more challenging to re-enter the workforce and contributing to a cycle of prolonged unemployment.\n4. Loss of social identity:\nWork provides individuals with a sense of purpose, identity, and belonging within society.\nWhen unemployed, individuals may experience a loss of social identity, feeling disconnected from the productive and valued roles they once held. This loss can impact self-esteem and overall psychological well-being.\n5. Generational impacts:\nUnemployment can have intergenerational effects, particularly when young individuals struggle to enter the job market or experience long periods of unemployment early in their careers.\nThis can hinder their long-term prospects, limit earning potential, and perpetuate cycles of poverty and unemployment within families.\n6. Increased inequality:\nUnemployment exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities within society.\nCertain marginalized groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, often face higher rates of unemployment and greater challenges in finding employment opportunities.\n7. Strain on public resources:\nHigh levels of unemployment place a burden on public resources, including social welfare programs and healthcare systems.\nGovernments must allocate significant funds to support the unemployed, provide job training, and address the social consequences of unemployment, which can strain public finances.\n8. Lost human potential:\nUnemployment represents a loss of human potential for both individuals and society.\nWhen individuals are unable to contribute their skills, knowledge, and talents to the workforce, it hampers overall economic growth and development. Society misses out on the innovations and productivity that a fully employed population can generate.\nSummary\nAddressing the negative impacts of unemployment requires a comprehensive approach that includes not only economic policies to s\nDoc 5(Title: \"Reasons Why Laws Change - Year 12 Legal Studies\") anging values within the community for example the legalisation of abortion and the banning of smoking in pubs/clubs and in cars with minors.\nChanging community awareness:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to changing community awareness. As a national community, we are much more informed today and aware of relevant issues largely due to the speed and efficiency of communication. As informed citizens, we put pressure on law makers to amend or introduce legislation in areas that we believe need to change. For example, Brodie's law was introduced in 2011 after a teenager ended her life due to bullying at a café where she worked. This law now makes it a serious crime (punishable by up to 10 years) to bully others in the workplace and holds spreads the responsibility of ending bullying.\nChanging Expectations of the Legal System:\nAnother reason why laws may need to change is due to the change expectations towards our legal system. Years ago, laws were expected to regulate behaviour however people now expect the law to uphold individual rights as well as protect people from harm. As such, the law has needed to take a more active role to ensure that it remains relevant. Examples of these include online defamation, duty of care and negligence.\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, inventions have changed people's lives in several ways:\n\n1.

This makes the Canadian dollar relatively stronger.\n\n2. **Oil Prices**: While oil prices have dropped, they still remain a significant factor for the Canadian dollar. Canada is a major oil exporter, so changes in oil prices can impact the currency.\n\n3. **Interest Rate Differential**: The Federal Reserve in the U.S. has raised interest rates to combat inflation, while Canada has maintained lower interest rates. This differential can attract investors to hold Canadian dollars, driving up its value.\n\n4. **Economic Data and Outlook**: Positive economic indicators in Canada, such as employment data and overall economic performance, contribute to a stronger currency.\n\nGiven these factors, the Canadian dollar is experiencing a rise, driven by the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar and positive domestic economic indicators. \n\n<answer> The Canadian dollar is rising due to the weakening U.S. dollar index, the impact of oil prices, interest rate differentials, and positive economic data. </answer>",

    "question": "how does sensory impairment affect children",
    "agent_answer": "Based on the information gathered, sensory impairment can significantly affect children in several ways:\n\n1. **Developmental Delays**: Children with sensory impairments may experience delays in reaching developmental milestones due to difficulties in processing sensory information. This can affect their physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development.\n\n2. **Communication Issues**: Hearing and visual impairments can lead to challenges in language acquisition and communication. Children might have trouble understanding speech, reading, or expressing themselves verbally.\n\n3. **Social Interaction**: Sensory impairments can impact a child's ability to interact socially. They might struggle to understand non-verbal cues, leading to difficulties in forming relationships and participating in group activities.\n\n4. **Learning and Education**: Children with sensory impairments may need specialized teaching methods and accommodations to access education effectively. Early intervention and tailored support are crucial for these children to succeed in school.\n\n5. **Emotional Well-being**: Coping with a sensory impairment can be emotionally challenging for children. They might experience frustration, anxiety, or depression, and require emotional support and counseling.\n\n6. **Physical Development**: Some sensory impairments can affect motor skills and coordination. For instance, visual impairments might limit a child's ability to explore their environment, while hearing impairments could impact balance and spatial awareness.\n\nTo support children with sensory impairments, it is essential to work closely with parents, teachers, and specialists. Early identification, appropriate interventions, and a supportive environment can greatly enhance a child's development and quality of life.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Sensory impairment can affect children in multiple ways, including developmental delays, communication issues, social interaction challenges, learning difficulties, emotional well-being, and physical development. </answer>",

The first happens when there is a fault in the inner ear – usually in the cochlea. This is called ‘sensorineural deafness’ and is permanent.\nThe level of hearing loss may be described as mild, moderate, severe or profound and may not be the same in each ear, with only a few children totally deaf.\nAmplification of residual hearing may be made possible with a hearing aid. The more profound the hearing loss, the greater the likelihood that the child will be given a cochlear implant, which allows electrical signals to be sent directly to the auditory nerve, providing a sensation of hearing.\nThe second type happens when sounds fail to pass efficiently through the outer and middle ear to the cochlea and auditory nerve. This is most commonly caused by a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, often referred to as ‘glue’ ear.\nThis is known as ‘conductive deafness’ and is the most common type of hearing loss. A conductive loss is likely to fluctuate and be temporary.\nIt is often treated by inserting grommets into the eardrum: ventilation tubes which allow fresh air to enter the middle ear to keep it free of fluid.\nMost children with a significant sensorineural hearing loss will have been identified before they enter your Early Years setting.\nOther children, particularly those with a fluctuating conductive loss, may not.\nAs an Early Years practitioner you have an important role to play in noticing and recording aspects of a child’s development that might indicate a hearing loss.\nLook out for the following signs in children:\n● Delayed development of speech\n● Watching your face and lips carefully when you’re speaking\n● Often failing to respond when called by name\n● Pausing after an instruction has been given, then watching other children to see what to do\n● Speaking unusually loudly or quietly\nA significant hearing loss can have a major impact on other aspects of a child’s development – particularly on communication and social interaction skills.\nThe child may use sign language, speech or a combination of the two. Unless steps are taken to help the child feel confident in social situations, they are likely to be withdrawn – remaining on the edge of groups of children or preferring a one-to-one activity with an adult.\nHow can I help?\nFirstly, it’s vital to work closely with the child’s parents. They will have an enormous amount of information about the nature of their child’s hearing loss and about the best means of communication.\nSecondly, a child with a significant hearing loss is likely to be having regular input from a specialist teacher or support assistant. It’s important to make time to seek their advice.\nYou can help a young child with a hearing impairment by:\n● Providing additional visual clues to support information you give verbally\n● Making sure that the child can see your face and lips when you’re speaking, and that you gain their attention before speaking\n● Checking that the child has understood you, repeating or giving extra clues if necessary\n● Considering learning sign language\n● Monitoring noise levels – a hearing aid amplifies everything, not just your voice\nSince 2006, all babies in the UK have been offered a hearing screen within a few days of birth. Initial concerns were raised about Beth’s hearing as a result of this screening.\nFurther assessment, when she was still only a few weeks old confirmed a profound, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss.\nAt first, a specialist health visitor visited Beth and her family regularly at home to monitor her progress and give advice.\nAfter her second birthday this input became the responsibility of a specialist teacher of the deaf, with additional input\nDoc 2(Title: \"SEN: Understanding sensory impairment | A Unique Child ...\") ild longer to explore new toys and activities\n● Considering providing a secure, familiar place to play\n● If a toy rolls out of reach, leading the child towards it to encourage independent exploration\n● Describing the things you or others do, to the child\n● Helping the child connect with others and to link present with past experiences\n● Encouraging other children to approach the child\n● Taking care not to overprotect the child, becoming a barrier between them and others\nDrew was born without eyes, and initial input to his family was provided by a specialist health visitor.\nFrom six months he attended a specialist parent and toddler group run by the QTVI and an SSA. He had weekly home visits from a Portage Home Visitor doing activities recommended by the QTVI.\nAs Drew approached his third birthday a place was sought in a nursery attached to a local primary school.\nPrior to Drew starting nursery his key worker was given time to spend with him at home. In this way she became familiar with his needs and he became familiar with her.\nWith advice from the QTVI, the nursery staff thought carefully about layout and routines before gradually introducing Drew into sessions. Mum stayed with him initially until he got his bearings.\nHis confidence grew and grew, and he became quite a ‘character’. 18 months later, following a thoroughly planned transition, Drew moved into the Reception class at the same school.\nBy this time he had a Statement of Special Educational Needs and daily input from an SSA.\nFor further information, contact: Royal National Institute of Blind People\nJulia Dunlop is a former senior educational psychologist and early ears specialist. As a teacher, she also had several years’ experience working with preschool children with disabilities in a Child Development Centre multi-disciplinary team.\nBody awareness – What it is & helping kids develop it\nEditors picks\nDoc 3(Title: \"SEN: Understanding sensory impairment | A Unique Child ...\") d a profound, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss.\nAt first, a specialist health visitor visited Beth and her family regularly at home to monitor her progress and give advice.\nAfter her second birthday this input became the responsibility of a specialist teacher of the deaf, with additional input from a special support assistant (SSA).\nBeth and her family developed skills in British Sign Language (BSL). Beth entered nursery at the age of three.\nThe SSA continued to support her and advice continued from the teacher – both in nursery and at home.\nHer key worker went on a BSL course and began to sign – not just with Beth but with all the children.\nSoon after Beth’s third birthday a cochlear implant was inserted. Nursery staff collaborated closely with the cochlear implant team from the hospital in monitoring any changes in Beth’s response to sound.\nIt soon became clear that the implant had made a difference and that Beth was increasingly able to recognise, react to and imitate some sounds.\nAt the age of four Beth transferred to a specialist unit within a mainstream primary school. Her signing skills had become more sophisticated and she had begun to develop a small vocabulary of spoken words.\nFor further information, contact: National Deaf Children’s Society\nThe term ‘visually impaired’ is used to describe a child who has sight problems severe enough to interfere with their learning.\nThe majority of children with a visual impairment still have some vision – only five per cent are totally blind.\nMost blind or partially sighted children have their sight problem from birth, though a small number lose their sight later in life following illness or an accident.\nMost children with a marked visual impairment will arrive in your ursery with their condition already diagnosed.\nYour observations can still contribute to the ongoing assessment of the child’s functional use of vision, linking with the Qualified Teacher of Visually Impaired children (QTVI).\nLook out for signs of impaired vision in children by noticing children who:\n● Display undue sensitivity to light\n● Close or cover one eye when attempting visual tasks\n● Often trip or bump into things\n● Holds books unusually close to their face\n● Tilt their head to an unusual angle when trying to focus\nSince 80 per cent of communication is non-verbal, young children with impaired vision are at a huge disadvantage when developing interpersonal skills.\nUnable to discern the facial expressions of others, they cannot ‘read’ reactions to things they say and find verbal turn-taking very difficult.\nThese children cannot learn by watching, only by doing.\nRestricted vision also leads to restricted mobility. In a typically developing child, vision is a huge motivator: seeing a desired toy just out of reach prompts the child to stretch for it or crawl towards it, but visually impaired children don’t know the toy exists.\nThe development of play – leading to concepts such as conservation, classification and one-to-one correspondence – is also negatively affected by visual impairment.\nWhen a child cannot observe others at play, it limits their own skills.\nFinally, independence and self-help skills are significantly delayed in a child with sight problems.\nClose links with parents and specialist professionals is vital. Additionally, you can help a young child with a visual impairment by:\n● Making wall displays colourful, clear and uncluttered\n● Offering toys with good colour contrast and books with simple illustrations\n● Offering activities that draw upon all the senses\n● Saying the child’s name before giving instructions\n● Giving individual demonstrations of tasks\n● Warning of changes in routine\n● Giving the child longer to explore new toys and activities\n● Considering providing a secure, familiar place to play\n● If a toy rolls out of reach, leading the child towards it to encourage independent exploration\n● Describing the things you or others do, to the child\n● Helping the child connect with others and t\nDoc 4(Title: \"Cognitive And Physical Early Childhood Development ...\") Physical And Mental Development During Childhood Growth\nAs a parent or guardian, you’re likely fascinated by all the firsts in your child’s life. Cognitive and physical milestones can help you track your child’s development and cognitive growth. For example, at six months old, a child should generally be able to roll from their stomach to their back and reach to grab the toys they want. Meanwhile, at nine months old, they will likely be able to move into a sitting position on their own and look for objects that drop out of sight. If you notice any potential delays, it can be best to speak to your child’s pediatrician to identify any potential underlying issues. Working with a therapist to develop effective parenting skills can also be helpful, and attending sessions online can make it easy to fit therapy into your schedule.\nWhat are developmental milestones?\nResearchers at the Centers for Disease Control generally define developmental milestones as the physical, mental, language, social, and emotional skills present in approximately 75% of children by a certain age.\nIt can be important to pay attention to how your child plays, learns new skills and information, speaks and understands language, and behaves with you and others for vital clues about their developmental progress.\nKey areas of physical and mental development during childhood\nCognitive development: How young children understand objects, take in sensory information, and engage with the world around them\nPhysical development: How your child moves their body, with large body movements like sitting and walking, and small body movements, such as control over their hands, reflexes, vision, sleeping, and eating\nLanguage development: How your child hears and understands sounds and uses speech to communicate\nSocial and emotional development: How your child interacts with and forms connections to the people who make regular appearances in their lives, such as parents, siblings, and grandparents, and how they react to strangers and places with new people\nTwo months: Rapid physical and cognitive growth\nDuring the first two months of their life, your child will likely learn, change, and grow by leaps and bounds. Children experience rapid physical and cognitive developmental milestones from birth to two months typically centering around developing basic senses, exploring their body parts and how they move, and learning about the world around them.\nPhysical development: Can hold their head up while on their stomach, move both arms and legs, and open their hands\nCognitive development: Watches you when you move and stares at toys or other objects for several seconds\nFour months: Developing perception\nMost babies at four months are developing their sense of perception. You may notice them reacting to familiar sounds and voices, recognizing faces they see frequently, and responding to others’ facial expressions with imitation.\nPhysical development: Can hold steady independently while being held, hold a toy when placed in their hand, use arms to swing at toys, bring hands to their mouth, and push up on their elbows while on their stomach\nCognitive development: Opens their mouth when seeing a breast or bottle if they’re hungry, stares at their hands with fascination\nSix months: Fantasy versus reality\nYour child at six months is likely full of wonder, often staring at objects that catch their interest. You may notice a developing ability to discern real things from fake ones, such as picking between a live animal and a stuffed toy.\nPhysical development: Rolls from their stomach to back, pushes up with straight arms from their tummy, and leans forward on hands for support while sitting\nCognitive development: Puts objects in their mouth, reaches to grab toys they want, and closes their mouth when they don’t want food\nNine months: Movement milestones\nMost babies at nine months old are expanding their movement abilities and trying to explore the world around them. They typically understand w\nDoc 5(Title: \"Cognitive And Physical Early Childhood Development ...\") e development: Puts objects in their mouth, reaches to grab toys they want, and closes their mouth when they don’t want food\nNine months: Movement milestones\nMost babies at nine months old are expanding their movement abilities and trying to explore the world around them. They typically understand when objects are gone, such as losing a bottle or snack.\nPhysical development: Can get to a sitting position by themselves, their motor development involves moving objects from one hand to the other, rake food with their fingers, and sit without support\nCognitive development: Looks for objects that drop out of sight and bangs two things together\nOne year: Learning communication\nAs they reach the one-year mark, your baby’s cognitive, social, and physical development usually speeds up, and you may notice them observing or imitating you and other adults. They may begin producing spoken language in the form of simple words or concepts.\nPhysical development: Can pull themselves up to stand, walk while holding on to furniture, drink from a cup without a lid that you hold, and pick up small objects between their thumb and pointer finger\nCognitive development: Can put something into a container and look for objects they see you hide\nFifteen months: Social development\nMost children can understand the difference between themselves and others by 15 months. You may notice that they can identify similar objects and imitate others’ actions or speech.\nPhysical development: Can take a few steps on their own and use their fingers to feed themselves food\nCognitive development: Tries to use objects for their correct function, such as cups or books, and can stack at least two small things, like blocks\n18 months: Play and physical exploration\nBy the time they are 18 months old, your baby may be actively learning through exploration and physical activity and frequently using their newfound mobility to see as much as possible. You may notice they can identify some objects in picture books, differentiate between “me” and “you,” and understand words enough to respond.\nPhysical development: Walks freely without support, scribbles, drinks from lidless cups with occasional spills, feeds themselves with their fingers, attempts to use a spoon, and can climb onto and off couches or chairs independently\nCognitive development: Can copy your movements during chores, like washing windows or sweeping, and engage in simple play with toys, such as babbling into a toy phone\nTwo years: A sense of independence\nBy the time they reach two years, your child will likely be developing a sense of independence. You may notice them begin to engage in pretend play. Much of their learning at this stage usually results from their experiences.\nPhysical development: Their motor skills have developed to being able to kick a ball, run, walk up a few stairs independently without climbing, and eat with a spoon\nCognitive development: Can hold something in one hand while using the other hand for another task, attempts to use buttons, knobs, or switches on toys, and frequently plays with more than one toy simultaneously\nMany children learn language structures and experience language acquisition to a more significant degree around the age of 24 months old. This subsequent language development is related to improving cognitive skills, which support language development.\n30 months: Continued exploration\nAt 30 months, your child may be becoming more independent and exploring their world. They may learn quickly and respond to simple directions from caregivers. You may notice they recognize their reflection and demonstrate increasing intelligence.\nPhysical development: Can use their hands to twist objects, such as doorknobs, remove some clothes independently, jump off the ground using both feet, and turn a single book page\nCognitive development: Often uses objects for pretend play, demonstrates problem-solving skills, can follow simple two-step instructions, and shows knowledge of at least one color\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information gathered, sensory impairment can significantly affect children in several ways:\n\n1. **Developmental Delays**: Children with sensory impairments may experience delays in reaching developmental milestones due to difficulties in processing sensory information. This can affect their physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development.\n\n2. **Communication Issues**: Hearing and visual impairments can lead to challenges in language acquisition and communication. Children might have trouble understanding speech, reading, or expressing themselves verbally.\n\n3. **Social Interaction**: Sensory impairments can impact a child's ability to interact socially. They might struggle to understand non-verbal cues, leading to difficulties in forming relationships and participating in group activities.\n\n4. **Learning and Education**: Children with sensory impairments may need specialized teaching methods and accommodations to access education effectively. Early intervention and tailored support are crucial for these children to succeed in school.\n\n5. **Emotional Well-being**: Coping with a sensory impairment can be emotionally challenging for children. They might experience frustration, anxiety, or depression, and require emotional support and counseling.\n\n6. **Physical Development**: Some sensory impairments can affect motor skills and coordination. For instance, visual impairments might limit a child's ability to explore their environment, while hearing impairments could impact balance and spatial awareness.\n\nTo support children with sensory impairments, it is essential to work closely with parents, teachers, and specialists. Early identification, appropriate interventions, and a supportive environment can greatly enhance a child's development and quality of life.\n</think>\n\n<answer> Sensory impairment can affect children in multiple ways, including developmental delays, communication issues, social interaction challenges, learning difficulties, emotional well-being, and physical development. </answer>",
