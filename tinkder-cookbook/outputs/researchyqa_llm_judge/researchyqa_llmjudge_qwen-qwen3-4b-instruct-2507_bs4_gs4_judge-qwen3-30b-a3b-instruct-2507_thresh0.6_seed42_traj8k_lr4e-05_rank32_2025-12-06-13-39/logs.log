[0m[33m<|im_start|>assistant
[0m[32mWasting water is harmful to the environment because it depletes freshwater resources, harms aquatic ecosystems, increases energy consumption for water treatment and pumping, and contributes to water scarcity, especially in arid regions. It also raises the demand for water infrastructure, leading to greater pollution and habitat destruction.

[0m[32mWasting water is bad for the environment because it leads to the depletion of freshwater resources, increases energy consumption for water treatment and distribution, contributes to pollution through overuse of water systems, and disrupts ecosystems that depend on stable water levels.
