[0m[32mEnding climate change is not something that can be priced in a simple monetary figure because it involves complex scientific, economic, political, and social factors. Climate change is a long-term global issue requiring widespread emissions reduction, transition to renewable energy, adaptation strategies, and international cooperation.
[0m[32m
[0m[32mHowever, estimates for the cost of mitigating climate change vary significantly depending on the scale of action, technology, and implementation. According to some studies:
[0m[32m
[0m[32m- The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate estimated that investing $2 trillion globally by 2030 could avoid the worst impacts of climate change and keep global warming below 1.5°C.
[0m[32m- Other estimates suggest that the global cost of addressing climate change could reach $100–$200 trillion over the coming decades if no significant action is taken.
[0m[32m
[0m[32mImportantly, "ending" climate change is not currently possible with existing technology or policies—instead, we focus on mitigating its impacts and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

[0m[33m<|im_start|>assistant
[0m[31mEnding climate change is not something that can be measured in a simple cost because it involves complex, long-term global actions across multiple sectors, including energy, transportation, agriculture, and policy. There is no single, definitive price tag for "ending" climate change, as it depends on the level of investment, technology, international cooperation, and time frame. However, estimates suggest that transitioning to a fully sustainable, low-carbon economy—such as achieving net-zero emissions—could require global investments between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually over the next few decades.
[0m[31m
[0m[31mThis cost would cover renewable energy infrastructure, carbon capture technologies, electric vehicles, sustainable agriculture, and climate adaptation efforts. Additionally, it would require significant changes in policies, behavioral shifts, and economic reforms.
