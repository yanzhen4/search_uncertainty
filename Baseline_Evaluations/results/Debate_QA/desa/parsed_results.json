Studies find greater psychopathology among violent offenders, especially convicted homicide offenders, and higher rates of violence perpetration and victimization among those with mental illness. Emotion dysregulation may be one way in which mental illness contributes to violent and/or criminal behavior. Although there are many stereotyped portrayals of individuals with dissociative disorders (DDs) being violent, the link between DDs and crime is rarely researched.\nMethods\nWe reviewed the extant literature on DDs and violence and found it is limited to case study reviews. The present study addresses this gap through assessing 6-month criminal justice involvement among 173 individuals with DDs currently in treatment. We investigated whether their criminal behavior is predicted by patient self-reported dissociative, posttraumatic stress disorder and emotion dysregulation symptoms, as well as clinician-reprted depressive disorders and substance use disorder.\nResults\nPast 6 month criminal justice involvement was notably low: 13% of the patients reported general police contact and 5% reported involvement in a court case, although either of these could have involved the DD individual as a witness, victim or criminal. Only 3.6% were recent criminal witnesses, 3% reported having been charged with an offense, 1.8% were fined, and 0.6% were incarcerated in the past 6 months. No convictions or probations in the prior 6 months were reported. None of the symptoms reliably predicted recent criminal behavior.\nConclusions\nIn a representative sample of individuals with DDs, recent criminal justice involvement was low, and symptomatology did not predict criminality. We discuss the implications of these findings and future directions for research.\nKeywords: Crime, Criminal behavior, Dissociation, Dissociative disorders, Trauma, Emotion dysregulation, PTSD, Violent crime\nBackground\nStereotypes abound in the media regarding violent behavior and crimes among those with mental illness. One need not look further than popular crime television shows, the latest blockbuster film or news stories on perpetrators of atrocities such as school shootings or terrorist attacks. Researchers have worked to unpack the complex question of what role mental illness plays in violence, if any, especially in light of mass shootings in the United States at Sandy Hook Elementary, Virginia Tech University and Pulse Nightclub, among others. Researchers generally agree that there is some relationship between mental illness and the risk for violence, such that mental illness increases the risk for violence perpetration as well as victimization, but there is less consensus on the specific psychopathology and symptoms that contribute to violence.\nA brief literature review on mental illness and violent behavior\nStereotypes about mental illness and violence are common among the general public. Link, Phelan, Bresnahan, Stueve and Pescosolido [1] presented a large sample (N = 1444) with vignettes of people with mental illness, in which no violent behavior or thoughts were described, and inquired how likely it was that the “patient” would be violent. Many participants believed it likely that the hypothetical mentally ill individual would perpetrate violence: 17% of respondents endorsed violence as likely among those with minor interpersonal problems, and 33% and 61% thought violence was likely among people with major depression or schizophrenia, respectively. Individuals with mental illness are frequently aware of others’ negative perceptions of them, which can worsen isolation, negative affect and treatment adherence [2, 3].\nIndividuals with psychological disorders that are highly stigmatized and misunderstood, such as schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder (BPD) and dissociative identity disorder (DID), oft\nDoc 2(Title: iatric illness and criminality. This narrative, coupled with a lack of adequate mental health resources, has positioned persons with mental illness in a precarious situation, often at the intersection of health and justice, with the scales tilted unjustly against them.[7]) Clinical Significance\nResearch suggests that untreated mental illness, especially when combined with active symptoms such as delusions or long-standing paranoia, may increase the potential for violent behavior. Cases in point include individuals experiencing command hallucinations, which may drive them to act in ways they would typically not. However, it's vital to differentiate between actions driven by psychiatric distress and those stemming from criminal intent.[8]\nAnother notable concern is the presence of comorbidities. Substance use disorder, for instance, stands out as a prominent risk factor. A comorbid substance use disorder can amplify the risk of engaging in violent or criminal behavior among individuals with major psychiatric conditions. Some studies even posit that the rise in violent crimes associated with mental illness might be predominantly attributed to a history of alcohol or drug use.[9] In patients with a major psychiatric illness with comorbid substance use disorder, there is a four-fold increase in the risk of committing a crime or violence.[10]\nBeyond the direct influence of psychiatric symptoms and substance use, other external factors also play a role. Socioeconomic factors such as unemployment and homelessness, combined with secondary effects of mental illness like cognitive impairments, can further compound the risk. For instance, individuals with untreated severe mental illness might find themselves in dire situations, leading them to commit crimes out of desperation or as a response to their environment.\nIt is also paramount to address the systemic challenges surrounding mental health care. Many individuals with mental illnesses grapple with accessing timely and appropriate treatment. Funding cuts and budgetary constraints in public health sectors have further strained the already limited resources, leading to an unfortunate scenario where individuals might be more likely to engage in criminal activity due to lack of adequate support. In fact, current mental health facility capacities in the U.S. are reminiscent of the severely lacking infrastructure from the 1850s. To address these concerns, we must understand the intricate balance between mental health and potential criminal behavior, ensuring that individuals receive the care they need while dispelling unfounded fears and misconceptions.\nOther Issues\nA far-sighted national mental health policy with expanded availability and access to treatment, while costly in the short run, could be a cost-effective and sensible approach. By some estimates, a ninety-day treatment in a mental hospital might prevent the 10-year imprisonment of an individual with mental illness. Expanded availability and access to mental health treatment would provide significant savings to society and crime victims. More importantly, it would improve a person with mental illness' quality of life and transform these individuals into productive members of society.\nThe link between psychiatric illness and criminality is complex and has profound societal implications. There is a great need for in-depth research and imaginative solutions for access and availability to mental health treatment. Currently, there is scant evidence to suggest that mental illness can independently predict criminal behavior. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that shows that persons with mental illness are far more likely to be the victim of violent crime rather than the perpetrator.\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nTo break the links between mental illness and criminality requires an inter-professional team of psychiatrists, social workers, and patient advocates to detect and reduce or eliminate risk factors that lead persons with\nDoc 3(Title: minality, challenging preconceived notions and advocating for a more nuanced understanding.[2]) Function\nThe public's tendency to equate psychiatric illness with criminality often stems from misunderstandings and societal norms. One significant factor contributing to this misconception is the mislabeling of criminals as persons with a mental illness. Such labeling is not always rooted in comprehensive medical or psychiatric evaluations but is influenced heavily by societal perceptions and stereotypes. This perspective is further reinforced when media and popular culture depict criminals as \"crazy\" or mentally unstable, thereby oversimplifying and misunderstanding the complexities of criminal behavior and mental health.[3]\nWithin correctional facilities, diagnoses such as Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) are frequently and arbitrarily applied. This practice has sparked debates among professionals about whether ASPD should be regarded as a genuine psychiatric illness or merely a reflection of societal moral judgments. The danger lies in the overuse of such labels, which might be employed as a means for criminals to evade responsibility for their actions by claiming mental illness as a cover. This underscores clinicians' crucial responsibility to ensure that psychiatric diagnoses are based only on evidence-based criteria and rigorous assessments.[4]\nFurthermore, while a significant number of inmates might exhibit symptoms associated with mental disorders, it is essential to differentiate between behaviors resulting from genuine psychiatric conditions and those arising from other factors, such as environmental stresses or learned behaviors. To address these challenges and prevent further misconceptions, it is imperative that mental health professionals, legal authorities, and the media work collaboratively. Educating the public and re-evaluating and refining the diagnostic processes within correctional facilities can serve as initial steps toward resolving these misperceptions.\nIssues of Concern\nHistorically, the interaction between psychiatric illness and criminality traces back to significant shifts in mental health care systems. For instance, the deinstitutionalization movement that began in the 1960s led to the closure of numerous state psychiatric hospitals. Consequently, many psychiatric patients found themselves on the streets, unshielded and unsupported, which naturally led to increased interactions with law enforcement. One glaring manifestation of this interplay is the disproportionate arrest and incarceration of individuals with mental illnesses. These arrests often arise from minor infractions such as jaywalking or displays of wandering behavior, which are misconstrued as threats to public order. A striking study noted that 12 percent of adult psychiatric patients receiving treatment in the San Diego County health system had histories of incarceration. Even more alarming, 28 percent of Connecticut residents treated for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder had experienced arrest or detention at some point.[5]\nFor many individuals with psychiatric illnesses, encounters with the police lead to entanglements with the courts and subsequent incarcerations. This is exacerbated by a widespread lack of training in the justice system to accurately recognize and respond to mental illness, leading to mischaracterizations and misguided judgments.[6] Furthermore, behaviors that are symptomatic of certain psychiatric illnesses, such as wandering or vocal outbursts, are sometimes wrongfully interpreted as criminal or antisocial. This misperception has fueled an unjustified and inaccurate belief in the causative relationship between psychiatric illness and criminality. This narrative, coupled with a lack of adequate mental health resources, has positioned persons with mental illness in a precarious situation, often at the intersection of health and justice, with the scales tilted unjustly against them.[7]\nClinical Significance\nResea\nDoc 4(Title: of violent crime rather than the perpetrator.) Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nTo break the links between mental illness and criminality requires an inter-professional team of psychiatrists, social workers, and patient advocates to detect and reduce or eliminate risk factors that lead persons with mental illness to commit a crime. This team approach includes a multi-tiered system that would identify at-risk patients early on and provide resources to prevent situations that bring the persons with mental illness in contact with the criminal justice system such as medical non-compliance and lack of food and shelter. For those individuals already inside the criminal justice system, there needs to be a targeted approach that includes rehabilitation, education, and empowerment. Finally, a concerted effort is required to educate the public at large and those in the criminal justice system, in particular, to dispel misperceptions and prevent mischaracterization, mislabeling of criminals as persons with mental illness and vice versa.\nReferences\n- 1.\n- Watson A, Hanrahan P, Luchins D, Lurigio A.

Lastly, potential psychological comordities to DDs related to violent behavior within the literature, such as mood and substance use disorders, should be examined as potential explanatorty variables for recent criminal justice involvement.) The present study\nMany questions remain regarding what role mental illness plays in violence. Are mentally ill individuals more likely to perpetrate violence compared to people who do not have mental illness? What psychiatric diagnoses are most highly associated with violent behavior and crime? Are individuals with DDs particularly likely to engage in violent and/or criminal behavior? The present study attempts to provide evidence on violent behavior and crime among individuals with DDs engaged in outpatient treatment.\nThe purpose of our study was threefold; first, to provide a review of the extant literature on DDs and violent behavior; second, to describe the prevalence of recent criminal justice involvement among a sample of treatment-engaged individuals with DDs; and third, to assess symptomatic predictors of violent behavior and crime among individuals with DDs, including dissociative, emotion dysregulation, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms, as well as problematic substance use. We hypothesized that crime rates would be low in our sample of individuals with DDs, with the majority of patients reporting no recent criminal history or involvement with the criminal justice system, unless their involvement was as victims of crime. Additionally, we hypothesized that the aforementioned symptoms (dissociation, emotion dysregulation, PTSD, depression and substance use) would not be significantly associated with recent criminal behavior and justice system involvement.\nMethods\nProcedure\nOverview and recruitment\nClinician and patient participants were recruited through the Treatment of Patients with Dissociative Disorders (TOP DD) Network study. The TOP DD Network study is a longitudinal educational intervention study of patients with DDs who are diagnosed with either DID or DDNOS/OSDD. Over the course of 1 year, patients and clinicians watched weekly 7–15 min psychoeducational and skills training videos and completed written reflection and behavioral exercises. Additionally, therapist and patient participants completed surveys every 6 months (at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months) that provided additional clinical and behavioral data.\nClinicians were recruited through listservs for mental health professionals, professional trauma conferences and emails to participated in the first TOP DD study [42, 43]. Clinicians were asked to enroll as a dyad with one DD patient from their caseload. All clinician and patient participants completed a voluntary consent process, and the study was approved by the Towson University Institutional Review Board. Eligibility requirements for patients in the TOP DD Network study included a DD diagnosis (DID, DDNOS or OSDD); being in treatment with their current clinician for at least 3 months prior to starting the study; reading English at an 8th grade level; being willing to continue in individual therapy and complete approximately 2 ½ hours weekly of study activities; and being able to tolerate references to trauma, dissociation and safety struggles.\nParticipants\nThe total TOP DD Network study included 242 patients who completed baseline measures, presented after the screening measures which verified study eligibility. TOP DD Network study patient participants were majority female (88.6%), Caucasian (82.1%), middle-aged (Median = 41), highly-educated (50.9% had at least a college diploma), and primarily resided in the United States (42.3%), although the study recruited internationally with a sizeable portion derived from Norway (27.5%) as well as other countries (30.2%). About half of participants (55.2%) were either in a dating or married relation\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, mental illness does not independently predict criminal behavior but it can increase the risk for violence perpetration and victimization.

But how will this money be spent and is it enough? What will the U.S. have to do in return? Given that we are on track for a record-breaking year in terms of illegal border crossings, what is at stake in terms of safety and security and what we must do to finally fix the border? Lora Ries is the director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at The Heritage Foundation, and on this episode, she explains.) Tim Doescher: Now we've got an incredible lineup of podcasts here at The Heritage Foundation. So much good content. But one podcast in particular that we wanted to highlight is The Kevin Roberts Show. Kevin is the new president here at The Heritage Foundation, and each week his compelling interviews give a rallying cry for lovers of freedom everywhere and gives us the playbook for how we can go on offense with our ideas. You can subscribe to the Kevin Roberts Show anywhere you listen to podcasts. So do it today. From The Heritage Foundation, I'm Tim Doescher and this is Heritage Explains.\nDonald Trump: And Mexico's going to pay for the wall, because Mexico ... I love the Mexican people. I respect the Mexican leaders, but the leaders are much sharper, smarter, and more cunning than our leaders. And just to finish people say, \"Oh, how are you going to get Mexico to pay?\" A politician, other than the people on this stage, I don't want to insult. A politician cannot get them to pay. I can.\nDoescher: That was candidate Donald Trump at a presidential debate in Colorado in October of 2015. Seems like an eternity ago. Now Trump spoke about the border a lot. And despite the narrative spun by the media, a lot actually happened under his administration. 458 miles of border wall was constructed, all sorts of ground sensing technology, drones, and other tech was implemented.\nDoescher: In addition, enforcing laws already on the books, like the Remain in Mexico Policy worked to keep border encounters down. While we never got a check from Mexico per se, increased cooperation with them, helped bring border crossings down. Then Biden took office. But before we get there, I wanted to cover one thing. A common measurement for illegal aliens crossing the border is the encounter count. Now an encounter is typically measured by two criteria.\nDoescher: First, apprehensions in which migrants are taken into custody in the United States to await adjudication. And two, expulsions in which migrants are immediately expelled to their home country or last country of transit without being held in us custody. So let's put it in context.\nDoescher: There were around 350,000 encounters at the Southern border in 2020, the last year of Trump's presidency. And in 2021, the first year of Biden's presidency around 1.1 million encounters. That's an over 210% increase. So what was the Biden administration's response, other than canceling the wall and killing the effective Remain in Mexico Policy?\nKamala Harris: Folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous track to the United States, Mexico border, do not come. Do not come.\nDoescher: Since Vice President Harris said that, we're on track to shatter encounter number records at the border for 2022. They're coming and they're not stopping. So what is the Biden Administration doing now? Here's CBS in Los Angeles.\nClip: President Biden and Mexican President Andreas Manuel Lopez [inaudible 00:04:14] at the White House announcing major agreements, including $1.5 billion in smart border technology paid for by Mexico.

Joe Biden: As I told you from the beginning and I mean this, I see, we see Mexico as an equal partner.\nClip: The two leaders met for several hours. President Biden announced the U.S. would expand the number of working visas, expand worker protections and said the U.S. would allow more refugees.\nDoescher: So let's recap. The number of encounters at the Southern border is through the roof and only getting worse. Mexico is now committing $1.5 billion over two years for smart border technology. And in return, the U.S. is going to increase the numbers of worker and refugee visas and provide more worker protection for them. So is this going to solve the crisis at the seemingly wide open border or is this just a political stunt, to be able to say Biden was able to get Mexico to pay for the border and Trump wasn't just in time for the 2022 midterm elections?\nDoescher: Lora Ries is the director of the Border Security and Immigration Center here at The Heritage Foundation. On this episode, she joins us to cut through the noise of politics and expose the consequences of president Biden's open door policies that have led to more deadly drugs, more hardened criminals escaping into our communities, and of course the devastating reality of migrants dying at record numbers.\nDoescher: And she'll make the case that true border security is actually safety and security for all. Lora, here's a headline from Market Watch, \"Mexican president Lopez [inaudible 00:06:20] agrees in meetings with Biden to fund 1.5 billion in smart border security. White House hails U.S. securing of border funding from Mexico after years of failed efforts to achieve that end by Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump.\" I want your first response to that headline.\nLora Ries: I think the left has been just waiting and itching to throw back in Trump's face when he said, \"We're going to build a big, beautiful wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.\"\nDoescher: Right.\nRies: And the left has always said, \"Well, they didn't pay for it.\" And so now the Biden Administration's getting a little bit of money from Mexico and voila.\nDoescher: Yeah.\nRies: Suddenly Mexico is paying for Biden, \"border security.\"\nDoescher: Yeah. And so it's 1.5 billion over two years. There's some more visas that we're going to extend to Mexico, there's little things, but it seems to me that this is a chance for a headline.\nRies: Exactly, exactly.\nDoescher: Okay. And it doesn't really get to securing the border.\nRies: No. Even when Joe Biden was campaigning for president, any verbiage he would dedicate to border security was more technology at the ports of entry. Now, that's a good thin. It's certainly needed, but he completely ignores everything that happens between the ports of entry. And that's where all the illegal immigration occurs. That's where the drugs cross, the terrorists cross the border, criminal aliens, et cetera.\nRies: And so it looks like they've made some back deal arrangement where Mexico throws a little bit of money to go towards this tech for ports of entry. But that won't affect the historic numbers of illegal aliens and drugs we're currently seeing.\nDoescher: It also seems to me like they can no longer, with the footage that we have at this border, they can no longer pretend like this isn't an issue. On the campaign, they criticized, I mean, they criticized Trump for four years for saying that this is an issue. Just criticizing him for saying it's an issue. And now here, even this seems like an admission. That there is something seriously wrong down there.\nRies: Yeah. During their joint press conference in the White House, even President Biden said historic levels of illegal immigration. And I recall at his most recent state of the union, he said, \"Let's secure the border.\" But for him, these are just words, because his policies don't match that at all.\nRies: We are seeing historic levels of illegal aliens, unaccom\nDoc 3(Title: e, even President Biden said historic levels of illegal immigration. And I recall at his most recent state of the union, he said, \"Let's secure the border.\" But for him, these are just words, because his policies don't match that at all.) Ries: We are seeing historic levels of illegal aliens, unaccompanied alien children, drugs, deaths at the border. All bad records. We've already hit 1.7 million for this fiscal year and we're not even done this fiscal year yet. And that's just year two for Biden. So if we take the number that has been thrown around for decades of 11 million illegal aliens reside in this country, Joe Biden is on track to nearly double that.\nDoescher: We're talking about border security here. But my question is and when you put this, \"Mexico's going to pay for this,\" or not going to pay for this, they're going to pay 1.5 billion for this. My question immediately was, why do we need Mexico to help us secure our border? It seems to me like that's something that we should be doing here, but it's just a pivot, because we can't get anything done or Biden doesn't want the responsibility maybe. I don't know why we need Mexico to do this.\nRies: Well, it's a valid question and this administration doesn't have the will to do it clearly, because they haven't changed course. Personally, I think this is a bit of a kickback. Mexico and many countries, Central America and elsewhere get a very good deal from this country, in that we give them billions of dollars of foreign aid. US is the biggest supplier of foreign aid to Mexico and central America.\nRies: We take their illegal aliens, mostly working age here and we let them come in and we let them stay here and we let them work here, even though that violates multiple laws. And then they send remittances back to their home country, which we don't even touch in the forms of taxes or fees or restrictions.\nRies: It's a great deal for Mexico and these other countries. And yet, we just let it happen. So I think President Lopez [inaudible 00:10:50] from Mexico sees Joe Biden to be weak, like many other leaders around the world do and they are taking advantage. And the fact that Mexico's going to pitch in \"1.5 billion over two years.\" I think for, if you take that out of the remittances Mexico's getting over the years, it's a drop in the bucket.\nDoescher: Do we know who is coming across these borders? Do we have any sense for that? Are we able to apprehend them and then find out, or are people just coming in and having their business?\nRies: Well, most people are turning themselves into the border agents, because they want to be \"processed.\" So what's done with them is basically a biometric check, maybe a quick name check, but the numbers are so high and the lines, so to speak are so large, that basically DHS kind of has to cut corners and just quickly process them north.\nRies: And a good example of this was one person was cleared to enter and then when the name check and the background check was finalized, we discover that he was a wanted known or suspected terrorist and already relocated to Florida. And it took ICE two weeks to get permission to go pick him up and remove him. So that's just one example.\nRies: And those are the people that are turning themselves in to be processed. Meanwhile, we have at least 800,000 got aways, people who don't want to be caught and sneaking across, bringing the drugs. We have to assume there's more known and suspected terrorists and other serious criminals in that large population.\nDoescher: Is there something that states can do about this? Is there something that we should be telling our friends in the states look out for this, watch for this? Because I betcha that for whatever solutions we might have, the left also has solutions and things ready for the states as well. So I'm wondering how you see that as a way of dealing with border security?\nRies: Well, under the law, it's the federal government's job to enforce immigration law, including removin\nDoc 4(Title: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Statement for the Record Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community) \nstic economic agenda.\n\nHowever, Mexico’s $1.15 trillion economy remains vulnerable to investor uncertainty that could\n\nweaken the export sector and slow economic growth, which was just 2 percent in 2017.

The number isn't really decreasing. It's basically going up. We are seeing more and more people see an opportunity to come illegally into the United States of America. Talk to the Oval Office right now. What is our first step here? Where do we turn this thing around?\nRies: Well, it's not just saying, \"The border is closed or secure.

Rather than allowing it to happen, processing them in and then paying for it on the back end.

And 1.5 billion just doesn't seem enough.\nRies: No, it doesn't. And ironically, the Mexican President said that the US respects Mexico's sovereignty.

Therefore, it is relatively safe but requires careful usage.\n\n<answer> No </answer>\n\nThe TOR network is not fully safe, though it enhances privacy significantly. Proper configuration and cautious usage are required to minimize risks.",

If this matters to you, you can reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a bridge rather than connecting directly to the Tor network. Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!) Be smart and learn more. Understand what Tor does and does not offer. This list of pitfalls isn't complete, and we need your help identifying and documenting all the issues.\nDoc 2(Title: Am I totally anonymous if I use Tor Browser?) Tor Browser includes many privacy protections, but it cannot guarantee perfect anonymity. Follow these best practices to reduce risks and stay safer online.\nGenerally it is impossible to have perfect anonymity, even with Tor. Though there are some things you can practice to improve your anonymity while using Tor and offline.\nUse Tor Browser and software specifically configured for Tor\nTor does not protect all of your computer's Internet traffic when you run it. Tor only protects applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor.\nControl what information you provide through web forms\nIf you visit a website using Tor Browser, they don't know who you are or your true location. Unfortunately many sites ask for more personal information than they need through web forms. If you sign in to that website, they still don't know your location but they know who you are. Further, if you provide: name, email, address, phone number, or any other personal information, you are no longer anonymous to that website. The best defense is to be vigilant and extremely cautious when filling out web forms.\nDon't torrent over Tor\nTorrent file-sharing applications have been observed to ignore proxy settings and make direct connections even when they are told to use Tor. Even if your torrent application connects only through Tor, you will often send out your real IP address in the tracker GET request, because that's how torrents work. Not only do you deanonymize your torrent traffic and your other simultaneous Tor web traffic this way, you also slow down the entire Tor network for everyone else.\nDon't enable or install browser plugins\nTor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. Similarly, we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and privacy.\nUse HTTPS versions of websites\nTor will encrypt your traffic to and within the Tor network, but the encryption of your traffic to the final destination website depends on that website. To help ensure private encryption to websites, Tor Browser includes HTTPS-Only Mode](../secure-connections/#https-only-mode-in-tor-browser) to force the use of HTTPS encryption with websites that support it. However, you should still watch the browser URL bar to ensure that websites you provide sensitive information to display a padlock or onion icon in the address bar, include https:// in the URL, and display the proper expected name for the website. Also see EFF's interactive graphic explaining how Tor and HTTPS relate.\nDon't open documents downloaded through Tor while online\nTor Browser will warn you before automatically opening documents that are handled by external applications. DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING. You should be very careful when downloading documents via Tor (especially DOC and PDF files, unless you use the PDF viewer that's built into Tor Browser) as these documents can contain Internet resources that will be downloaded outside of Tor by the application that opens them. This will reveal your non-Tor IP address. If you must work with files downloaded via Tor, we strongly recommend either using a disconnected computer, or using dangerzone to create safe PDF files that you can open. Under no circumstances is it safe to use BitTorrent and Tor together, however.\nFind company\nTor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to. However, by default, it does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from learning that you're using Tor. If this matters to you, you can reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a bridge rather than connecting directly to the Tor network. Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it\nDoc 3(Title: kes sense to use for data that needs to stay private far into the future.) \"If you encrypt your data today using standard techniques, it will likely be kept private for a decade. It's hard to know what the status of current cryptosystems will be beyond that time,\" says Vidick. \"Today's cryptography is based on math that is hard to solve today, but in 50 years, maybe it won't be so hard to solve. For credit card transactions, that's fine. For medical records or government information that is meant to stay secret for longer, it may not be.\"\nIs quantum cryptography used today?\nScientists have demonstrated that QKD works, but it is not widely used due to significant technological limitations. To send a quantum key, a single-photon laser beams a signal, one photon at a time, via a fiber optic cable. This method is slower than current telecommunication technologies and requires a dedicated fiber optic cable between the two parties. For example, Amazon could not secure customer transactions using quantum encryption because it would require cables between its servers and individual devices that make purchases. Distance is also a factor. When fiber optic cables are used to transmit data, as in your home internet and cable systems, they use repeaters to send the data over longer distances. However, those repeaters disturb the delicate quantum state that is crucial to QKD.\nResearchers in China have demonstrated QKD over long distances using a combination of fiber optic cables with \"trusted relay nodes\" as repeaters and a satellite that transmits photons through the air. However, more research is needed to create a system that transmits keys reliably and efficiently.\nIn theory, quantum cryptography is unhackable, because eavesdropping would always be detected, but its practical uses are limited. \"If you build a house, it's only going to be as strong as the weakest pillar,\" says Vidick. \"To have a truly usable system, you may need to combine quantum cryptography with elements that are not quantum, and those other elements could be vulnerable to attacks that theorists have not envisioned.\"\nDoc 4(Title: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Statement for the Record Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community) \nnd their affiliates are likely to expand their influence over some**_\n\n_**weak states, collaborate with US adversaries, and possibly threaten critical infrastructure.**_\n\n• Mexican criminals use bribery, intimidation, and violence to protect their drug trafficking,\n\nkidnapping-for-ransom, fuel-theft, gunrunning, extortion, and alien-smuggling enterprises.\n\n• Gangs based in Central America, such as MS-13, continue to direct some criminal activities\n\nbeyond the region, including in the United States.\n\n19\n\n_**Transnational organized crime almost certainly will continue to inflict human suffering, deplete natural**_\n\n_**resources, degrade fragile ecosystems, drive migration, and drain income from the productive—and**_\n\n_**taxable—economy.**_\n\n• Human trafficking generates an estimated $150 billion annually for illicit actors and\n\ngovernments that engage in forced labor, according to the UN’s International Labor\n\nOrganization.\n\n• Wildlife poaching and trafficking; illegal, unregulated, unlicensed fishing; illicit mining; timber\n\npilfering; and drug-crop cultivation harm biodiversity, as well as the security of the food supply,\n\nwater quality and availability, and animal and human health.\n\n• One think tank study estimates that cybercrime, often facilitated by cryptocurrencies, and\n\nintellectual property theft resulted in $600 million in losses in 2017; such crimes threaten\n\nprivacy, harm economic safety, and sap intellectual capital.\n\nECONOMICS AND ENERGY\n\n_**Global growth—projected by the IMF to remain**_\n\n_**steady in 2019—faces downside risks as global**_\n\n_**trade tensions persist, many countries contend**_\n\n_**with high debt levels, and geopolitical tensions**_\n\n_**continue**_.

Despite the war’s immense cost in blood and treasure, little was accomplished other than destabilizing the country, paving the way for the rise of ISIS, and increasing Iran’s influence in the region.\nThe continued U.S. troop presence in the country does little more than put Americans in harm’s way.\nWhat went wrong in Iraq?\nThe primary mistake leaders made regarding Iraq was invading in the first place. Justifications for invasion varied, from shoddy claims that Saddam Hussein’s regime had weapons of mass destruction and was collaborating with al-Qaida, to beliefs the U.S. could transform the state into a modern American-style democracy that would eventually turn the Middle East into a peaceful and stable region.\nBut any justification was weak at best, and vital American security interests were never at stake in Iraq.\nFrom the very beginning, it was clear we could not impose a democratic system that would transform Iraqi society. A similar aim proved just as impossible in Afghanistan. American planners were woefully ignorant of the social conditions on the ground and were ill-prepared to deal with sectarian and tribal divides within the country that had been suppressed by harsh authoritarian tactics for decades.\nToppling Saddam Hussein unleashed conditions for turmoil. A series of reckless actions by U.S. occupation authorities, such as quickly disbanding the Iraqi army, drove many young men into an emerging insurgency. Later, the new Iraqi government, led by the Shiite majority which had previously been suppressed by the Sunni-aligned Hussein regime disenfranchised Iraqi Sunnis, further aiding insurgent recruitment and an environment which sparked years of deadly sectarian clashes.\nThis chaos that unfolded in the wake of the U.S. regime change effort helped create an opening for ISIS to gain support among many Iraqi Sunnis in the years to come. When ISIS launched an offensive in 2014, the Iraqi army suffered major defeats after putting up little resistance and abandoning American equipment and weapons that ISIS was able to easily capture. One analysis of captured ISIS ammunition from the summer of 2014 found that nearly a fifth was made in the U.S., likely because it was formerly in Iraqi army hands.\nAs a result, while combatting ISIS, American forces found themselves tacitly cooperating with Shiite militias that were backed by Iran to defeat ISIS, leaving Iraq more firmly under the influence of our geopolitical rival than ever.\nWhile American actions did remove a brutal dictator, the terrible consequences that followed for our servicemembers and the Iraqi people were far worse in the long run.\nWas the Iraq War a mistake?\nThe U.S. should not have invaded Iraq to facilitate regime change and engage in nation-building.\nThe war had nothing to do with American national interests, and it was especially foolhardy to attempt while the U.S. was simultaneously attempting a counter-terrorism campaign and subsequent nation-building efforts, however misguided, in Afghanistan.\nThe Hussein regime was undoubtedly an inhumane and vicious dictatorship, but to paraphrase President John Quincy Adams, it is not America’s duty to vanquish every monster on the international stage. American foreign policy must be narrowly focused on protecting vital American interests.\nIn a time of uncertainty and crisis shortly after the September 11th attacks, many Americans, who were misled by the Bush administration about intelligence on Iraqi WMDs, felt the war was necessary. Before the invasion, majorities of Americans supported war and significantly outnumbered those opposed.\nNevertheless, many experts made the brave decision to publicly oppose what they feared would be a grave mistake for the U.S.\nIn the fall of 2002, a large number of international relations scholars ran a full-page letter in the New York Times arguing that war with Iraq is not in America’s national in\nDoc 2(Title: Iraq: A Morally Justified Resort to War) \nlay targeted ads.

Regardless of why Iraq was invaded, it is reasonable to assume that an occupier would exploit rather than destroy its assets. Indeed, the neoconservatives used oil both as an incentive to get the energy industry onside and as a disincentive against dissent, threatening exclusion from future oil contracts. Oil may have played a part in the thinking of some policy makers – as Juan Cole argues it had in Dick Cheney's – but even Cole admits that Iraq was invaded only because the Israel lobby was blocking all other means of access to it. If oil were indeed the overriding concern, it is likelier that we would have US boots on Venezuelan ground. After all, nowhere were US interests more threatened than in Latin America, and few governments had a more provocative attitude towards the US than Hugo Chavez's. Yet, the US was able to do little when the Venezuelan government rewrote laws to claim 30 per cent (up from 16 per cent) of the oil profits for the national oil company.) — Muhammad Idrees Ahmad, The Road to Iraq: The Making of a Neoconservative War[183]\nOther rationales\n[edit]Bringing democracy to the Middle East\n[edit]One of the rationales that the Bush administration employed periodically during the lead-up to the Iraq war was that deposing Saddam Hussein and installing a democratic government in Iraq would promote democracy in other Middle Eastern countries.[187] The United States also proclaimed that the monarchies in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and the military government of Pakistan were American allies, despite the human rights abuses and subversion of democracy attributed to them respectively. As Vice President Cheney argued in an August 2002 speech to the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, \"When the gravest of threats are eliminated, the freedom-loving peoples of the region will have a chance to promote the values that can bring lasting peace.\"[188]\nAt a 2003 Veterans Day address, President Bush stated:[189]\nOur mission in Iraq and Afghanistan is clear to our service members – and clear to our enemies. Our men and women are fighting to secure the freedom of more than 50 million people who recently lived under two of the cruelest dictatorships on earth. Our men and women are fighting to help democracy and peace and justice rise in a troubled and violent region. Our men and women are fighting terrorist enemies thousands of miles away in the heart and center of their power, so that we do not face those enemies in the heart of America.\nEstablishing long-term Middle East military presence\n[edit]US General Jay Garner, who was in charge of planning and administering post-war reconstruction in Iraq, compared the US occupation of Iraq to the Philippine model in a 2004 interview in National Journal: \"Look back on the Philippines around the turn of the 20th century: they were a coaling station for the navy, and that allowed us to keep a great presence in the Pacific. That's what Iraq is for the next few decades: our coaling station that gives us great presence in the Middle East\", \"One of the most important things we can do right now is start getting basing rights with (the Iraqi authorities)\", \"I hope they're there a long time ... And I think we'll have basing rights in the north and basing rights in the south ... we'd want to keep at least a brigade\", Garner added.[190]\nAlso, the House report accompanying the emergency spending legislation said the money was \"of a magnitude normally associated with permanent bases\".[191]\nOther allegations\n[edit]Nabil Shaath told the BBC that according to minutes of a conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Bush said, \"God inspired me to hit al Qaeda, and so I hit it. And I had the inspiration to hit Saddam, and so I hit him.\"[192] Haaretz provided a similar translation of the minutes. When an Arabist at the Washington Post translated the same transcript, Bush was said to have indicated that God inspired him to \"end the tyranny in Iraq\" instead.[193]\nIn a\nDoc 5(Title: Rationale for the Iraq War) There are various rationales that have been used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Iraq War, and subsequent hostilities.\nThe George W. Bush administration began actively pressing for military intervention in Iraq in late 2001. The primary rationalization for the Iraq War was articulated by a joint resolution of the United States Congress known as the Iraq Resolution. The United States intent was to \"disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people\".[1]\nIn the lead-up to the invasion, the United States and the United Kingdom falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction, covertly supporting al-Qaeda, and that he presented a threat to Iraq's neighbors and to the world community.

Several thousand troops remained in the country until all American troops were withdrawn from Iraq by December 2011.

As a result, relations between the United States, the United Nations, and Iraq remained strained.

The US and the United Nations maintained a policy of \"containment\" towards Iraq, which involved economic sanctions, Iraqi no-fly zones enforced by the United States, United Kingdom, and France (until it ended its no-fly zone operations in 1998) and ongoing inspections of Iraqi weapons programs.[11] In 2002, the UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441 demanding that Iraq \"comply wi\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems the Iraq War was not justified based on the lack of substantial evidence for weapons of mass destruction, the unintended consequences, and the mismanagement of the post-invasion situation.

Bush administration began actively pressing for military intervention in Iraq in late 2001. The primary rationalization for the Iraq War was articulated by a joint resolution of the United States Congress known as the Iraq Resolution. The United States intent was to \"disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people\".[1]\nIn the lead-up to the invasion, the United States and the United Kingdom falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction, covertly supporting al-Qaeda, and that he presented a threat to Iraq's neighbors and to the world community. According to the Center for Public Integrity, eight senior-level officials in the Bush administration issued at least 935 false statements in the two years leading up to the war.[2] The US stated, \"On 8 November 2002; the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1441.

Regardless of why Iraq was invaded, it is reasonable to assume that an occupier would exploit rather than destroy its assets. Indeed, the neoconservatives used oil both as an incentive to get the energy industry onside and as a disincentive against dissent, threatening exclusion from future oil contracts. Oil may have played a part in the thinking of some policy makers – as Juan Cole argues it had in Dick Cheney's – but even Cole admits that Iraq was invaded only because the Israel lobby was blocking all other means of access to it. If oil were indeed the overriding concern, it is likelier that we would have US boots on Venezuelan ground. After all, nowhere were US interests more threatened than in Latin America, and few governments had a more provocative attitude towards the US than Hugo Chavez's. Yet, the US was able to do little when the Venezuelan government rewrote laws to claim 30 per cent (up from 16 per cent) of the oil profits for the national oil company.) — Muhammad Idrees Ahmad, The Road to Iraq: The Making of a Neoconservative War[183]\nOther rationales\n[edit]Bringing democracy to the Middle East\n[edit]One of the rationales that the Bush administration employed periodically during the lead-up to the Iraq war was that deposing Saddam Hussein and installing a democratic government in Iraq would promote democracy in other Middle Eastern countries.[187] The United States also proclaimed that the monarchies in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and the military government of Pakistan were American allies, despite the human rights abuses and subversion of democracy attributed to them respectively. As Vice President Cheney argued in an August 2002 speech to the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, \"When the gravest of threats are eliminated, the freedom-loving peoples of the region will have a chance to promote the values that can bring lasting peace.\"[188]\nAt a 2003 Veterans Day address, President Bush stated:[189]\nOur mission in Iraq and Afghanistan is clear to our service members – and clear to our enemies. Our men and women are fighting to secure the freedom of more than 50 million people who recently lived under two of the cruelest dictatorships on earth. Our men and women are fighting to help democracy and peace and justice rise in a troubled and violent region. Our men and women are fighting terrorist enemies thousands of miles away in the heart and center of their power, so that we do not face those enemies in the heart of America.\nEstablishing long-term Middle East military presence\n[edit]US General Jay Garner, who was in charge of planning and administering post-war reconstruction in Iraq, compared the US occupation of Iraq to the Philippine model in a 2004 interview in National Journal: \"Look back on the Philippines around the turn of the 20th century: they were a coaling station for the navy, and that allowed us to keep a great presence in the Pacific. That's what Iraq is for the next few decades: our coaling station that gives us great presence in the Middle East\", \"One of the most important things we can do right now is start getting basing rights with (the Iraqi authorities)\", \"I hope they're there a long time ... And I think we'll have basing rights in the north and basing rights in the south ... we'd want to keep at least a brigade\", Garner added.[190]\nAlso, the House report accompanying the emergency spending legislation said the money was \"of a magnitude normally associated with permanent bases\".[191]\nOther allegations\n[edit]Nabil Shaath told the BBC that according to minutes of a conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Bush said, \"God inspired me to hit al Qaeda, and so I hit it. And I had the inspiration to hit Saddam, and so I hit him.\"[192] Haaretz provided a similar translation of the minutes. When an Arabist at the Washington Post translated the same transcript, Bush was said to have indicated that God inspired him to \"end the tyranny in Iraq\" instead.[193]\nIn a\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, the justification for the Iraq War was primarily based on false claims about weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorism, which turned out to be unfounded. </think>\n\n<answer> No </answer>\n\nThe Iraq War was not justified given the lack of substantial evidence for weapons of mass destruction and the misleading claims that fueled the conflict.",

According to the most optimistic scenario provided by the study, the chances that human civilization survives are smaller than 10%. To avoid this collapse, the study says, humanity should pass from a civilization dominated by the economy to a \"cultural society\" that \"privileges the interest of the ecosystem above the individual interest of its components, but eventually in accordance with the overall communal interest.\"[34][35]\n- Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at the University of Oxford known for his work on existential risk, argues\n- that it would be \"misguided\"[36] to assume that the probability of near-term extinction is less than 25%, and\n- that it will be \"a tall order\" for the human race to \"get our precautions sufficiently right the first time\", given that an existential risk provides no opportunity to learn from failure.[3][21]\n- Philosopher John A. Leslie assigns a 70% chance of humanity surviving the next five centuries, based partly on the controversial philosophical doomsday argument that Leslie champions. Leslie's argument is somewhat frequentist, based on the observation that human extinction has never been observed, but requires subjective anthropic arguments.[37] Leslie also discusses the anthropic survivorship bias (which he calls an \"observational selection\" effect on page 139) and states that the a priori certainty of observing an \"undisastrous past\" could make it difficult to argue that we must be safe because nothing terrible has yet occurred. He quotes Holger Bech Nielsen's formulation: \"We do not even know if there should exist some extremely dangerous decay of say the proton which caused the eradication of the earth, because if it happens we would no longer be there to observe it and if it does not happen there is nothing to observe.\"[38]\n- Jean-Marc Salotti calculated the probability of human extinction caused by a giant asteroid impact.[39] It is between 0.03 and 0.3 for the next billion years, if there is no colonization of other planets. According to that study, the most frightening object is a giant long-period comet with a warning time of a few years only and therefore no time for any intervention in space or settlement on the Moon or Mars. The probability of a giant comet impact in the next hundred years is 2.2×10−12.[39]\n- As the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction estimated in 2023, there is a 2 to 14% (median: 8%)[Unclear what the median represents in this context. Over what distribution is it calculated?] chance of an extinction-level event by 2100, but there was a 14 to 98% (median: 56%) chance of an extinction-level event by 2700.[40][clarification needed]\n- Bill Gates told The Wall Street Journal in January 27, 2025 that he believes there is a 10–15% (median - 12.5%) chance of a natural pandemic hitting in the next four years, but he estimated that there was also a 65-97.5% (median - 81.25%) chance of a natural pandemic hitting in the next 26 years.[41]\n- On March 19, 2025, Henry Gee said that humanity will be extinct in the next 10,000 years. To avoid it happening, he wanted all humanity to establish space colonies in the next 200-300 years.[42]\n- On September 11, 2025, Warp News estimated a 20% chance of global catastrophe and 6% chance of human extinction by 2100. They also estimated a 100% chance of global catastrophe and a 30% chance of human extinction by 2500.[43]\nFrom nuclear weapons\n[edit]In November 13, 2024, American Enterprise Institute estimated a probability of nuclear war durin\nDoc 2(Title: en to Earth if humans went extinct?

Second, the increasing human population is encroaching on ecosystems that would otherwise be intact. Third, factory farming fosters the creation of millions upon millions of animals for whom it offers nothing but suffering and misery before slaughtering them in often barbaric ways. There is no reason to think that those practices are going to diminish any time soon. Quite the opposite.\n- ^ MacCormack, Patricia (2020).

Mr Trump pledges to undo the Obama administration’s climate initiatives including Paris Accord and Clean Power Plan, and expand fossil fuel production (17,21).) FIREARMS-RELATED INJURIES AND DEATHS\nClinton would expand background checks; remove the gun industry’s sweeping legal protection; support laws that stop domestic abusers from buying and owning guns, make it a federal crime for someone to intentionally buy a gun for a person prohibited from owning one; and close the loopholes that allow people suffering from severe mental illness to purchase firearms. She would also “work to keep assault-style weapons off the streets.” Mr Trump promises to nominate justices that will uphold the second amendment; enforce laws on the books and prosecute violent criminals; expand programs “to get gang members and drug dealers off the street”; empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves; expand mental health treatment programs; and reform the laws “to make it easier to take preventive action to save innocent lives.” He supports national right to carry and proposes to fix the background check system we have and make it work as intended, “what we don’t need to do is to expand a broken system.” He opposes gun and magazine bans — “the government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own” (17).\nPRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING\nBoth Clinton and Trump support reimportation of US manufactured drugs if the safety of the drugs can be assured. Secretary Clinton would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices; require manufacturers to provide rebates in the Medicare low-income subsidy program equivalents to Medicaid; place a monthly limit of $250 on covered out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for individuals; increase the availability of generic drugs by prohibiting “pay-for-delay” deals and by fully funding the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Office of Generic Drugs to clear out their generic drug approval backlog; lower the biologic exclusivity period from 12 years to 7 years, and direct the FDA to give prioritized, expedited review to biosimilar applications with only one or two competitors in the marketplace. Other than support for reimportation, Mr Trump has not offered detailed policies to curtail excessive drug pricing. At one point during the campaign, he said he favored Medicare negotiating drug prices but that position no longer is listed on his campaign website (17,18).\nThe one health policy area where Trump and Clinton seem to mostly agree is addressing the opioid epidemic, where both have proposed expanded treatment programs, getting over-dose reversal drugs in the hands of first-responders; and promoting best practices on safe-prescribing (17,18).\nOne issue that neither candidate has sufficiently addressed is the growing administrative burden that governmental and nongovernmental programs are imposing on physicians, and the impact it is having on physician burnout and on patient care.

They spent nearly $51.4 million on advertisements at the point of sale alone.\nTobacco industry marketing, advertising and promotions have been found to:\n- Encourage youth smoking uptake.[1, 2, 3, 4] The NCI has demonstrated a causal relationship between exposure to tobacco advertisements and youth smoking uptake. Across multiple studies, research has shown that youth more frequently exposed to tobacco promotion are 60% more likely to have tried smoking and 30% more likely to be susceptible to future smoking.[5] Read more.\n- Increase total cigarette sales.[6, 7]\n- Distort youth perceptions about the availability, use and popularity of cigarettes.[2, 3] Read more on the impact of tobacco retailers near schools and the Center for Public Health and Tobacco Policy’s fact sheet “Influencing Youth at the POS.”\n- Foster positive brand imagery.[8]\n- Cue cravings and undermine quit attempts.[2, 9, 10, 11]\n- Fuel tobacco-related disparities. The tobacco industry has a long history of targeted marketing toward low income and minority populations[12,13] Read more on disparities in point of sale advertising.\nFor more information on the impact of tobacco marketing, advertising and promotions, review this fact sheet developed by the California Department of Public Health. To learn more about the the problem and why retail tobacco control is important read Counter Tobacco’s “War in the Store” and “Why Retail Tobacco is Important” pages or read the Deadly Alliance Report.\nWhat are POS Advertising Restrictions?\nThe 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gave states and local governments the power to enact certain restrictions on tobacco advertising. Review this presentation by ChangeLab Solutions and the Public Health Law Center to learn more about how the 2009 Act impacts regulation of tobacco advertising and promotions.\nThe Public Health Law Center suggests the following strategies for restricting tobacco advertising at the point of sale. Refer to their guide, “Restricting Tobacco Advertising” for more details:\n- Restrict ALL advertising without regard to its content (“content neutral” advertising restriction). This would affect advertising for all products (e.g. alcohol, food, toys, etc.), not just tobacco. For example, some municipalities limit the percentage of window space that can be taken up by advertisements of any kind, place limits on the size or number of advertisements allowed, or restrict the location of advertisements.

The following examples illustrate potential time, place and manner restrictions:\n-\n- Time restrictions: Require retailers to cover or remove advertising during times when youth are present (e.g., after school hours).\n- Place restrictions: Prohibit tobacco advertising at stores near schools or within 10 feet of the cash register. For example, the State of New York has prohibited the display of exterior tobacco advertisements within 1500 feet of schools (500 feet within New York City).\n- Manner restrictions: Prohibit certain types of tobacco advertising (e.g. outdoor signage or sandwich board style ads).

For example, Colorado prohibits retailers form advertising e-cigarette products in a manner that is visible from outside.) You can implement POS advertising restrictions through three main mechanisms:\n- State or local laws or ordinances: Laws can be passed at the state or local level to directly restrict tobacco advertising. The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention & Tobacco Control Act gave state and local governments the authority to enact these restrictions, in order to address public health concerns, especially protecting youth from the harms of tobacco.\n- Licensing laws: Advertising restrictions can be incorporated as stipulations (or “plug-ins”) of tobacco retail licensing. See Counter Tobacco’s page on Licensing and Zoning for more information about tobacco retail licensing. Licensing laws that affect the density, location or type of tobacco retailers will also inherently reduce exposure to POS advertising.\n- Zoning laws: Zoning laws can restrict advertising for retailers in certain zones. Some communities have “sign laws” that regulate how advertisements can be posted, which are usually content neutral restrictions. See Counter Tobacco’s page on Licensing and Zoning for more information about zoning. Zoning regulations that impact the density, location or type of tobacco retailers will also inherently reduce exposure to POS advertising.\nAnother way to reduce exposure to tobacco advertising at the point of sale is through more comprehensive tobacco control policies, including limits on the the number of retailers in a community that can sell tobacco, restrictions on the types of products sold, and/or prohibiting price promotions and discounts.[18] For example, a study evaluating the impacts of restrictions on the sale of flavored tobacco products found that in cities with restrictions on the sale of flavored tobacco products, exterior store advertising for tobacco products overall decreased following implementation of the policies to a greater extent than cities without a restriction in place.[19]\nThe evidence for implementing POS advertising restrictions\nThe tobacco industry channels the vast majority of its marketing expenditures to the point of sale, making POS advertising restrictions a critical strategy to subvert industry attempts to attract new, current, and recently quit smokers. Since few US states and localities have successfully implemented POS advertising restrictions, their impact in the US is not well known, but they are expected to reverse some of the effects of advertising, such as reducing youth uptake, reducing tobacco-related disparities, and changing norms about tobacco use. In fact, a global study recently showed that POS advertising bans reduce experimental smoking among youth by 31%.[14] The World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control calls for comprehensive restrictions on tobacco advertising and international studies have found that these policies do in fact reduce consumption[15] and perceived prevalence of smoking by youth.[16] To learn more about limiting product displays and “power walls,” which the tobacco industry consider part of its advertising strategy, visit our page on restricting tobacco product placement.\nAfter conducting retail store assessments at all 26 retailers in Bamberg County and receiving training on point-of-sale tobacco control from Counter Tools, the Tri-County Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCCADA) was looking for next steps to help address the glut of tobacco marketing present in their community. As the name implies, the Commission covers two other counties in South Carolina: Orangeburg and Calhoun. TCCADA planned to conduct store assessments in those two counties as well, and they took a look at the tobacco control laws currently on the books in all three counties.

This study examines the immediate and long term effectiveness of advertising restrictions enacted in different countries on exposure to different forms of product marketing, and examines differences in exposure across different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Nationally representative data from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the United States, collected from adult smokers between 2002 and 2008 using the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4), were used in this study (N = 21,615). In light of the specific marketing regulation changes that occurred during the course of this study period, changes in awareness of tobacco marketing via various channels were assessed for each country, and for different SES groups within countries. Tobacco marketing regulations, once implemented, were associated with significant reductions in smokers’ reported awareness of pro-smoking cues, and the observed reductions were greatest immediately following the enactment of regulations. Changes in reported awareness were generally the same across different SES groups, although some exceptions were noted. While tobacco marketing regulations have been effective in reducing exposure to certain types of product marketing there still remain gaps, especially with regard to in-store marketing and price promotions.\nKeywords: tobacco control, marketing regulation, socioeconomic differences, public policy\n1. Introduction\nMarketing theory suggests several mechanisms through which tobacco advertising and promotion can be effective, including: increasing experimentation with/initiation of smoking, increasing individuals’ cigarette consumption, decreasing quit attempts/quit success rates, and enticing former smokers to begin smoking again [1]. Empirical research confirms the role that marketing plays in fostering positive smoking attitudes and expectations among adolescents which, in turn, increases their likelihood of becoming smokers [2,3]. Marketing efforts have also been successful in portraying smoking as being normal and socially acceptable to adults, making it less likely for current smokers to feel compelled to quit [4,5]. Further, the presence of tobacco advertisements in stores, particularly cigarette displays, makes it harder for smokers who try to quit smoking to be successful in doing so [6].\nGiven the harmful influence of tobacco advertising and promotion on current, potential, and former smokers, marketing regulation is a necessary component in the effort to combat the global tobacco epidemic. The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the WHO FCTC) has responded by calling on member Parties to implement extensive tobacco regulatory strategies, including the enactment of comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship activities [7]. Such bans have been shown to be effective in reducing tobacco consumption, both in developed countries [8] and in developing countries [9].\nSince 2002, various tobacco marketing regulations have been enacted in the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Australia and the United States. Table 1 presents an overview of the extent of these marketing regulations in each of the four countries.\nTable 1.\nX = complete ban, O = partial ban, - = no ban.\nIn the UK, the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 (TAPA) banned almost all types of tobacco marketing according to the following timeline: by 2003, print and broadcast media, billboard advertisements, arts sponsorships, and free sample, special price, gift/discount, leaflet, Internet, and email promotions were banned [10]. Sports sponsorships were partially banned in 2003 and completely banned by\nDoc 5(Title: By: Carol Duh-Leong, MD, MPP, FAAP) Each year, tobacco companies spend billions of dollars to promote their products, including\nelectronic cigarettes that are especially popular with young people. Research shows these advertisements reach, and strongly influence, children and teens.\nSmoke Signals\nNearly 7 out of 10 middle and high school students say they've seen e-cigarette ads, for example, according to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. Statistics like these worry public health experts, since studies show the more cigarette ads teens see, the more likely they are to try smoking. Research also suggests that seeing characters who smoke in movies makes them more likely to try cigarettes.\nMany teens who try smoking don't stop. In fact, about 9 out of 10 smokers began the habit by age 18, according to a U.S. Surgeon General\nreport.\nTeens go through big developmental changes, forming their own identities and taking more risks. They also begin to pay more attention to being accepted by friends. One\nstudy found that cigarette ads may make teens feel like smoking would make them popular, sophisticated, attractive or tough.\nWhat Parents Can Do\nBe aware of and discuss how seemingly subtle points in cigarette ads can send a powerful, and potentially harmful, message to teens.\nTalk with your teen. Teens really do value the opinions of their parents. If you are with your teen and you see a cigarette ad, talk about it. Tell your teen that his or her feelings are important, and start a constructive and respectful discussion where both of you can express your feelings and opinions about smoking.\nThink beyond tobacco. E-cigarettes and other electronic smoking devices, such as\nhookah, might be advertised as less harmful to health than regular cigarettes. Ads may make a point of saying that e-cigarettes vaporize flavored “vape juice\" rather than burning tobacco. Make sure your teen knows the nicotine from vaping is still highly addictive. In addition,\nresearch shows teens who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke regular tobacco. This research supports the concept that e-cigs serve as a “gateway\" to traditional cigarettes.\nMonitor screen time. Many teens exposed to cigarette ads, especially those for e-cigarettes, report seeing them on the internet and TV (unlike ads for regular cigarettes, e-cigarette ads are legally allowed to air on TV). A 2018\nstudy in Pediatrics found that teenagers who watched videos about tobacco products online, for example, were more likely to try and use tobacco products more frequently. They were also less likely to stop using the products. Make a family\nmedia use plan to help limit the influence of these ads on your children.\nIdentify your teen's talents. Adolescence is a time when teens are trying to find their identity. It is important for parents to be positive about their teen's talents and goals—whether it be basketball or social studies. This will help them develop a strong sense of identity outside of potentially unhealthy habits.\nGet involved in the community. Whether it be with the school's parent-teacher association or local health programs in your city, parents have a strong voice in the\ncommunity. You can say no to cigarette ads in places where your child lives and plays.\nShop Around. If your local pharmacy or mini-mart displays cigarette ads, consider shopping at stores that do not sell traditional cigarettes or e-cigarettes.\nRemember\nCigarette ads can have a strong influence on children and teens. But there are steps you can take to protect against their powerful pull, helping kids avoid a future clouded by tobacco and nicotine.\nMore information:\nAbout Dr. Duh-Leong:\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, tobacco advertising and promotions significantly contribute to youth smoking uptake and distort youth perceptions about the availability, use, and popularity of cigarettes.

They could be used to model subatomic particles, molecular interactions, and chemical reactions. This could revolutionize chemical engineering and material science and allow the design of new materials, such as solid-state batteries. Quantum computers could also help us understand climate change.\n\nQuantum computers could transform the financial system, too. They could perform more accurate Monte Carlo simulations—used to predict the behavior of markets through pricing and risk simulations—almost in real time. There would be no need to simplify these models with unrealistic assumptions. Quantum computers could also solve optimization tasks—such as allocating capital, determining portfolio investments, or managing the cash in ATM networks—in a fraction of the time it takes digital computers. Quantum computers could also speed the training of machine learning algorithms. The time it takes digital computers to do this increases exponentially with each dimension that is added. Not so with quantum computers.\n\n###### And the perils\n\nThere are risks, however. The computing power of these mighty quantum machines could threaten modern cryptography. This has far-reaching implications for financial stability and privacy. Today’s cryptography is based on three main types of algorithms: _symmetric keys_, _asymmetric keys_ (also known as _public keys_), and _hash functions_. With symmetric keys, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Asymmetric cryptography uses a pair of related keys (one private and the other public). A message encrypted by one key can be decrypted only by that key’s pair. These algorithms are widely used for digital authentication, digital signatures, and data security. Hash functions convert digital input into a unique set of bytes of fixed size. They are used to store passwords securely and to support digital identities.\n\nThese cryptographic algorithms have mostly succeeded in safeguarding data. Even today’s most advanced digital supercomputers and cryptanalysis techniques cannot break them fast enough. However, quantum computers will be able to solve hard mathematical problems exponentially faster than digital supercomputers. This will make asymmetric cryptography [obsolete](https://www.etsi.org/committee/cyber?id=1805) and will weaken other cryptographic keys and hashes. Theoretically, a fully functioning quantum computer could break an asymmetric key in a matter of minutes. Public keys are especially vulnerable because most of them are based on the factorization problem: it is hard for digital computers to find two prime numbers from their product. Quantum computers, by contrast, can do it effortlessly.\n\nAsymmetric keys are widely used to secure communications over the internet. Successful attacks against these algorithms would compromise connections used by the financial system, including mobile banking, e-commerce, payment transactions, ATM cash withdrawals, and VPN communications, to name just a few. Vulnerable applications that rely on public-key cryptography also include popular digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as password-protected web applications. The best known of these protocols, [HTTPS](https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en), is used by 97 of the world's top 100 websites.\n\nFor some applications, it may be too late already. Any information assumed secure today could be captured and stored to be deciphered later once sufficiently powerful quantum computers are created. In fact, almost any encrypted personal or financial message sent and stored today could be deciphered retroactively by a powerful quantum computer. Most financial institutions and regulators are not yet alert to these novel risks.\n\n###### Race against the machine\n\nThe race to develop new quantum-safe encryption standards and algorithms h\nDoc 2(Title: Quantum Computing's Possibilities and Perils) \n6 min (1503 words) Read\n\n_Quantum computers could crack the cryptography that underpins financial stability_\n\nSoldiers in ancient Greece would send secret dispatches by wrapping a strip of parchment around a staff and writing across it. Their messages could be deciphered only by someone with a staff of the same thickness. It is one of the earliest examples of cryptography. Today’s secrets, such as Internet communication, digital banking, and electronic commerce, are protected from prying eyes by powerful computer algorithms. Yet these hitherto impenetrable cryptographic codes could soon be history.\n\nQuantum computers can reach a level of optimization that would crack many of today’s encryption keys in less time than it takes to generate them using conventional digital computers. Financial institutions should future-proof their cybersecurity systems without delay. Failure to do so will imperil financial stability.\n\n###### A quantum revolution\n\nQuantum computing is the use of quantum phenomena such as _superposition_ and _entanglement_ to perform computations. The basic unit of a quantum computer is the quantum bit (or _qubit_, for short). It is typically realized by the quantum properties of subatomic particles, such as the spin of electrons or the polarization of a photon. Whereas each binary bit used in today’s digital computers represents a value of either zero or one, qubits represent both zero and one (or some combination of the two) at the same time. This phenomenon is called superposition. Quantum entanglement is a special connection between pairs or groups of quantum elements. Changing the state of one element affects other entangled elements instantly—regardless of the distance between them.\n\nToday's impenetrable cryptographic codes could soon be history.\n\nIncreasing the number of qubits delivers an exponential rise in calculation processing speed. Two traditional binary bits are needed to match the power of a single qubit; four bits are required to match two qubits; eight bits are needed to match three qubits; and so on. It would take about 18 quadrillion bits of traditional memory to model a quantum computer with just 54 qubits. A 100 qubit quantum computer would require more bits than there are atoms on our planet. And a 280 qubit computer would require more bits than there are atoms in the known universe.\n\nQuantum computers have the potential to massively out-process digital computers that follow classical laws of physics. William Phillips, the Nobel Prize–winning physicist, has compared the leap from today’s technology to quantum with that from the [abacus](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/2018/04/quantum-information-a-scientific-and-technological-revolution-for-the-21st-century/) to the digital computer itself. Until recently, this so-called _quantum advantage_ or _quantum “supremacy”_ was just a theory. In 2019, however, Google used a quantum computer to perform a specific computation task in just 200 seconds. The same task would, the company said, have taken the most powerful digital supercomputer at that time [10,000 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5).\n\n###### The possibilities\n\nComplex computational tasks are like finding the way out of a maze. A traditional computer would try to escape by following every path in sequence until it reached the exit. Superposition, by contrast, allows a quantum computer to try all the paths at once. This drastically reduces the time to find a solution.\n\nBy solving problems with more accuracy and speed than digital computers, quantum computers have the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and innovation, revolutionize financial market modeling and simulations, and empower machine learning and artificial intelligence. They could be used to model subatomic particles, molecular interactions, and chemical reactions. This could revolutionize chemical engineering and material science and allow the design of new m\nDoc 3(Title: Quantum Computing's Possibilities and Perils) \nor financial message sent and stored today could be deciphered retroactively by a powerful quantum computer. Most financial institutions and regulators are not yet alert to these novel risks.\n\n###### Race against the machine\n\nThe race to develop new quantum-safe encryption standards and algorithms has begun already. In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is running a competition to develop quantum-safe encryption algorithms. It hopes to announce a [winner by 2024](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8309/final). The European Telecommunications Standards Institute is also taking a lead. These efforts are feeding into the activities of other standard-setting bodies. Because of retroactive risks, however, financial institutions have a narrow window to implement the new standards.\n\nFinancial institutions must take immediate steps to prepare for a [cryptographic transition](https://www.etsi.org/committee/cyber?id=1805). They should start by assessing retroactive and future risks from quantum computers, including from information that may already have been captured and can be exploited years later. Financial institutions should then develop plans to migrate current cryptography to quantum-resistant algorithms. This includes taking an inventory of public-key cryptography they use themselves as well as that used by any third-party suppliers. Vulnerable algorithms will need to be transitioned to post-quantum cryptography. Financial institutions should also build cryptographic agility so that algorithms can be upgraded smoothly. Experiences of algorithm replacements, even though much simpler than the transition to post-quantum standards, show that they can be extremely disruptive. They often take years or [decades to accomplish](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25196/quantum-computing-progress-and-prospects).\n\nThe IMF has an important role to play in raising the awareness of its members about the risks to financial stability from quantum computers and in promoting quantum-safe standards and practices. The Fund should encourage member countries to collaborate closely in developing quantum-safe encryption standards to ensure interoperability and adopt encryption migration plans for their financial sectors.\n\nToday’s quantum computers are very sensitive. Any environmental disturbance, such as heat, light, or vibration, pulls qubits out of their quantum state and turns them into regular bits. This produces computation errors. Still, machines that compute with fewer errors and are capable of cracking codes are not far off. Financial institutions should recognize the risks and secure their systems before it is too late. After all, history is full of cautionary tales of supposedly unbreakable codes being cracked by new technology.\n\n_This article is based on IMF Working Paper 21/71, “_[_Quantum Computing and the Financial System: Spooky Action at a Distance?”_](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/03/12/Quantum-Computing-and-the-Financial-System-Spooky-Action-at-a-Distance-50159)\n\n![Image 1](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Images/IMF/FANDD/authors/malaika-300.ashx?h=300&w=300&la=en)\n\n**MAJID MALAIKA** a lead digital transformation and cybersecurity risk expert in the IMF’s Information Technology Department.\n\n![Image 2](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Images/IMF/FANDD/authors/gorbanyov-300.ashx?h=300&w=300&la=en)\n\n**MICHAEL GORBANYOV** is a senior economist in the IMF’s Strategy, Policy, and Review Department.\n\n![Image 3](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Images/IMF/FANDD/authors/deodoro-300.ashx?h=300&w=300&la=en)\n\n**JOSÉ DEODORO** is the data collection platform owner in the IMF’s Information Technology Department.\n\nOpinions expressed in articles and other materials are those of the authors; they do not necessarily reflect IMF policy.\nDoc 4(Title: mes concrete, most vulnerable organizations will immediately move to upgrade all their communications systems to post-quantum cryptography. This forced transition may well be very expensive, chaotic, and disruptive, but it will fairly quickly neutralize most attack vectors (with one important exception mentioned below). The true nightmare scenario would be if a hostile actor (such as a criminal or terrorist organization or a hostile foreign government) covertly operated a CRQC over a long time period before PQC becomes universal, allowing the actor to collect a huge amount of sensitive information undetected.) Fortunately, it is extremely unlikely that any organization will develop a CRQC in secret, for at least four interrelated reasons.\nAnyone trying to develop a high-performance quantum computer will face stiff competition from commercial industry.\nFirst, anyone trying to develop a high-performance quantum computer will face stiff competition from commercial industry. Quantum computers have the potential to enable many commercial applications that have nothing to do with decryption, such as drug design, materials science, and numerical optimization. While there is huge uncertainty in the pace of technology development and the timelines for useful applications, some people have predicted that quantum computers could deliver over a trillion dollars in economic value over the next decade. Many private companies are racing to produce state-of-the-art quantum computers in order to profit from these applications, and there is currently no clear technical industry leader. Moreover, these companies are collectively extremely well funded: U.S. quantum computing startups alone have raised over $1.2 billion in venture capital, and that total does not include other major players such as national laboratories, large self-funding companies, or non-U.S. companies.\nIn the near term, these companies face some incentives to publicize their technical capabilities and other incentives to keep them proprietary. But in the long run, companies need to advertise their capabilities at a reasonable level of technical detail in order to attract customers. The closer the state of the art in commercial industry comes to the technical performance required to execute Shor's algorithm, the clearer the threat will become to potential targets, and the more urgently they will prioritize upgrading to PQC.\nAny organization attempting to secretly develop a CRQC would therefore need enormous financial resources in order to compete with the well-funded and competitive commercial industry, and it would need to stay far ahead of that industry in order to keep the element of surprise.\nA relatively small number of people are at the cutting edge of quantum computing development in industry or academia.\nThe second reason that a CRQC is unlikely to be developed in secret is that a relatively small number of people are at the cutting edge of quantum computing development in industry or academia, and they are well known within the expert community. Any organization attempting to secretly develop a CRQC would need to acquire world-class talent—and if many of the greatest technical experts suddenly left their organizations or stopped publishing in the technical literature, then that fact would immediately be fairly evident, just as it was during the Manhattan Project. (However, this point may become less relevant in the future as the commercial industry matures. As the pool of expert talent grows and more information becomes business proprietary, public information about the top technical talent may decrease.)\nThird, a CRQC might be physically difficult to hide. It's extremely difficult to estimate the physical resources that will be required to operate a CRQC, but my recent research suggests that a CRQC might plausibly draw 125 megawatts of electrical power, which is a significant fraction of the total power produced by a typical coal-fired power plant. A device that requir\nDoc 5(Title: Quantum leap: why the next wave of computers will change the world) \n more.

That is the ability of quantum computers to perform certain tasks that a classical computer simply cannot do in a reasonable timeframe. Their quantum computer solved a problem in 200 seconds that would take the world’s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years.\n\nThe problem that was solved is without any practical merits or implications, yet it demonstrates the huge potential quantum computers have and the ability to unlock that potential in the coming years.\n\nThis opens up a completely new era where we can now focus on building quantum computers with practical benefits and while this will still be many years away, it will be the new frontier in computation.\n</information>\n\n\n From the information provided, it is clear that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize problem-solving and encryption.

But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.) Obviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voters. She has real shortcomings, like any male or female candidate. They were evident in her failure to put Sanders away early on in the primaries. Her national approval ratings are remarkably low for a presidential nominee, and part of that can be traced to men and women across the political spectrum who have legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton (though her likeability numbers are gendered as well; and of course some women hold subconscious biases towards female candidates, too). White men began abandoning the Democratic Party in the 1960s, for reasons that had nothing to do with gender. The trend accelerated under Ronald Reagan and shows no signs of slowing today.\nStill, social science evidence, primary exit polls and my interviews with researchers and dozens of voters indicate that white men’s attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. “The gender issue, people say it shouldn’t matter anymore,” said Nancy Mills, a member of the Democratic National Committee and longtime powerbroker in Pennsylvania politics. “But it always matters because it exists. You can’t ignore it and make it go away.”\nSocial psychology research tells us that everyone thinks they’re not prejudiced, and everyone is wrong.

They all insisted that they weren’t sexist. Nevertheless, many said they were uncomfortable with the thought of a female president.\n“Bias in general, whether it’s directed at gender, race, or anything else, is more automatic than people think,” said Susan Fiske, a leading researcher on prejudice and stereotypes who teaches at Princeton University. “And it’s also more ambivalent than we realize.

Rather, it’s to work through a thorny issue at the heart of this election that many men, like myself, probably haven’t spent as much time thinking about as we should. We don’t have to if we don’t want to, which is just one of many unfair privileges that come with being a man.\nIt can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms.

That’s when Fiske, working with Peter Glick, a social psychologist at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, published a breakthrough paper that laid out their ambivalent sexism theory. The theory, which has since been accepted by researchers around the world, helped form the basis for how experts study sexism today. Fiske and Glick separated sexism into two distinct categories. The first kind, known as “hostile” sexism, encompasses overtly negative views about women. It’s what we usually associate with gender discrimination.

The relentless spotlight on an opponent’s supposed criminality is another departure. Republicans maintain Clinton broke the law by sending classified information on her private email server. Trump’s campaign has worked to sow distrust by using vague insinuations against Clinton that are hard to prove or disprove. On Wednesday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort mused that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had “probably” given special information to Bill Clinton that helped his wife avoid criminal charges, during a brief airport meeting that Lynch has acknowledged was a mistake. He said the “Lock her up!” chant punctuating speeches at the conventions “probably reflects the attitude of a lot of people in America.” “They don’t understand why justice wasn’t done,” he said.

Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean tow\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the provided information, it seems clear that there is a significant concern regarding subconscious bias and sexism among white male voters towards Hillary Clinton. However, exact percentages attributing votes strictly to gender are not explicitly stated. The article discusses the challenges Clinton faces with white male voters and mentions complex mixes of conscious and subconscious sexism, but no direct statistics on gender-based voting motives are provided.\n\nGiven the complexity and lack of exact percentages from available sources, let's refine the question to seek specific data on gender motivations among voters. Based on the discussions and implications around voter behavior and attitudes towards Clinton:\n\n<search> specific studies on percentage of Hillary Clinton's supporters who voted for her due to gender </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.) Obviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voters. She has real shortcomings, like any male or female candidate. They were evident in her failure to put Sanders away early on in the primaries. Her national approval ratings are remarkably low for a presidential nominee, and part of that can be traced to men and women across the political spectrum who have legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton (though her likeability numbers are gendered as well; and of course some women hold subconscious biases towards female candidates, too). White men began abandoning the Democratic Party in the 1960s, for reasons that had nothing to do with gender. The trend accelerated under Ronald Reagan and shows no signs of slowing today.\nStill, social science evidence, primary exit polls and my interviews with researchers and dozens of voters indicate that white men’s attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. “The gender issue, people say it shouldn’t matter anymore,” said Nancy Mills, a member of the Democratic National Committee and longtime powerbroker in Pennsylvania politics. “But it always matters because it exists. You can’t ignore it and make it go away.”\nSocial psychology research tells us that everyone thinks they’re not prejudiced, and everyone is wrong.

Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, American voters face a similar set of choices as they did four years ago – and many are not happy about it.\nWith the election still more than six months away, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that the presidential race is virtually tied: 49% of registered voters favor Donald Trump or lean toward voting for him, while 48% support or lean toward Joe Biden.\nA defining characteristic of the contest is that voters overall have little confidence in either candidate across a range of key traits, including fitness for office, personal ethics and respect for democratic values.\nWhere Trump has the advantage: More than a third of voters say they are extremely or very confident that Trump has the physical fitness (36%) and mental fitness (38%) needed to do the job of president.\nFar fewer say the same of Biden (15% are at least very confident in his physical fitness; 21% are extremely or very confident in his mental fitness). Majorities say they are not too or not at all confident in Biden’s physical and mental fitness.\nWhere Biden has the advantage: More voters are extremely or very confident in Biden (34%) than in Trump (26%) to act ethically in office. And while 38% say they are at least very confident in Biden to respect the country’s democratic values, fewer (34%) express that level of confidence in Trump. The survey was conducted before the start of Trump’s “hush money” trial in New York City.\n(Read more about voters’ views of Biden and Trump in Chapter 2.)\nThe state of the 2024 presidential race\nThe new Center survey of 8,709 adults – including 7,166 registered voters – conducted April 8-14, 2024, finds large divides in voters’ candidate preference by age, education, and race and ethnicity. As was the case in 2020, younger voters and those with a four-year college degree are more likely to favor Biden than Trump.\nOlder voters and those with no college degree favor Trump by large margins.\nAmong racial and ethnic groups:\n- White voters favor Trump (56%) over Biden (42%) by a wide margin.\n- Roughly three-quarters of Black voters (77%) support Biden, while 18% back Trump.\n- Hispanic voters are more evenly divided – 52% favor Biden, while 44% back Trump.\n- Asian voters favor Biden (59%) over Trump (36%).\n(Read more about voters’ candidate preferences in Chapter 1.)\nMost voters who turned out in 2020 favor the same candidate in 2024. Among validated 2020 voters, overwhelming majorities of those who cast ballots for Biden (91%) and Trump (94%) support the same candidate this year. Registered voters who did not vote in 2020 are about evenly divided: 48% back Trump, while 46% support Biden.\nA majority of voters say “it really matters who wins” the 2024 race. Today, 69% of voters say it really matters which candidate wins the presidential contest this November. This is somewhat smaller than the share who said this in April 2020 about that year’s election (74%). Nearly identical shares of Biden’s and Trump’s supporters say the outcome of the presidential race really matters.\nAbout half of voters would replace both Biden and Trump on the 2024 ballot\nReflecting their dissatisfaction with the Biden-Trump\n</information>\n\n\n\n\n</think>\n\nBased on the articles and context, there isn't a precise statistic stating what percentage of Hillary Clinton's supporters voted specifically due to her gender. Given the detailed discussions on sexism and gender bias affecting her voter base, especially white males, and the lack of direct quantitative evidence, we might infer indirect impacts but without exact percentages:\n\n<search> percentage of Hillary Clinton's supporters who voted for her because of gender studies </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.) Obviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voters. She has real shortcomings, like any male or female candidate. They were evident in her failure to put Sanders away early on in the primaries. Her national approval ratings are remarkably low for a presidential nominee, and part of that can be traced to men and women across the political spectrum who have legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton (though her likeability numbers are gendered as well; and of course some women hold subconscious biases towards female candidates, too). White men began abandoning the Democratic Party in the 1960s, for reasons that had nothing to do with gender. The trend accelerated under Ronald Reagan and shows no signs of slowing today.\nStill, social science evidence, primary exit polls and my interviews with researchers and dozens of voters indicate that white men’s attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. “The gender issue, people say it shouldn’t matter anymore,” said Nancy Mills, a member of the Democratic National Committee and longtime powerbroker in Pennsylvania politics. “But it always matters because it exists. You can’t ignore it and make it go away.”\nSocial psychology research tells us that everyone thinks they’re not prejudiced, and everyone is wrong. We all have built-in biases, whether we recognize them or not. I spoke to white men across Pennsylvania and Ohio last month for this story — Democrats and Republicans, old men and young guys, middle class professionals and blue-collar workers. They all insisted that they weren’t sexist. Nevertheless, many said they were uncomfortable with the thought of a female president.\n“Bias in general, whether it’s directed at gender, race, or anything else, is more automatic than people think,” said Susan Fiske, a leading researcher on prejudice and stereotypes who teaches at Princeton University. “And it’s also more ambivalent than we realize. So that makes it harder to detect in ourselves.”\nI should say here that my goal is not to mansplain the way that sexism works to people who already get it. Rather, it’s to work through a thorny issue at the heart of this election that many men, like myself, probably haven’t spent as much time thinking about as we should. We don’t have to if we don’t want to, which is just one of many unfair privileges that come with being a man.\nIt can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You're either racist or you're not. But actually, it's not that simple.\nThe theory of ambivalent sexism, more than anything else, helps illustrate men’s subconscious bias against Clinton, but it’s hard to understand — at least it was for me — because it clashes with many people’s ideas about prejudice. It can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You’re either racist or you’re not. The same thinking applied to gender up until the mid-1990s. That’s when Fiske, working with Peter Glick, a social psychologist at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, published a breakthrough paper that laid out their ambivalent sexism theory. The theory, which has since been accepted by researchers around the world, helped form the basis for how experts study sexism today. Fiske and Glick separated sexism into two distinct categories. The first kind, known as “hostile” sexism, encompasses overtly negative views about women. It’s what we usually associate with gender discrimination. The second kind, known as “benevolent” sexism, describes positive attitudes and actions which men take toward women that are based, deep-down, in feelings of superiority and dominance.\n“Men have ambivalent attitudes toward women that are prejudiced and paternalistic, but that are also based on lo\nDoc 2(Title: By Huge Margin, Americans Say Clinton Is More Qualified, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds, Except For Honesty, She Tops Trump On Key Qualities) Share\nShare\nDoc 3(Title: that followed, Clinton won diverse states and Sanders carried predominantly white ones. The racial divide was startling. During one stretch in late March and early April, when Sanders won seven consecutive contests, the Democratic electorate in the states that he carried was on average 72 percent white. And the gender gap in white states remained constant. Sanders won the male vote by 29 points in Wisconsin, and 19 points in West Virginia, to name just two examples. Sanders developed a loyal following, but it mainly consisted of young people, including a vanguard of “Bernie Bros,” and older white men.) Ryan Geiser, an ardent Sanders supporter, takes a break from work in downtown Pittsburgh. Geiser says he believes Sanders would have fared worse in the primaries if he had faced a white man.\nNot all male Sanders supporters are flagrant sexists, of course. Most aren’t. They responded to Sanders’ economic message and unvarnished campaign trail persona. He successfully cast himself as an outsider candidate despite his decades-long career in Congress, which is no small feat. The 74-year-old socialist senator from Vermont turned out to be a much better fundraiser than anybody expected. Bernie struck a nerve. At the same time, it’s not a coincidence that so many white men chose him over the female alternative.\n“I don’t think there’s any question that there’s gender bias,” said Ryan Geiser, 29, an ardent Sanders supporter from Bellevue, Pa. Geiser, who is white, said that he didn’t base his decision on gender, but knows plenty of Sanders supporters who did. “If Sanders had gone up against a man who had the same politics as Hillary, he wouldn’t have done as well because more white men would have voted for the other guy.” There is strong evidence that subconscious bias shaped the way white men viewed Clinton in the primaries. So just imagine how much sexism could impact the general election, now that Clinton is running against Donald Trump.\nIn late May, I interviewed a group of five white men who get together each afternoon at the Mountaineer Cafe in Berlin, in southwestern Pennsylvania. The day we met at the diner, where a cup of coffee costs $1.55 and comes with a view of the main intersection in town, a light rain was falling outside. Don Williams, a 91-year-old retired welder, and Max Bowser, who is 75 and worked as a truck driver, were the first to arrive. They were soon joined by Elmer Altfather, 83, a retired carpenter; Ted Robb, 80, who worked for a railroad company; and Larry Pritts, 75, a retired heavy equipment operator and former member of Berlin’s town council. The longtime friends are split along party lines: two are Democrats, and three are Republicans.\n“Donald Trump scares me,” Bowser, who is a Republican, said as our conversation got underway. “But we need a change, and I’m willing to give someone the right to change it.”\nWilliams, who is also conservative, and has followed the election closely despite his advanced age, chimed in: “We need a big boom.”\n“Yeah,” said Bowser. “But not Hillary. I don’t like the way she lies. They’ve caught her in so many lies.”\nBowser, like nearly every Republican voter I interviewed for this story, pointed to the Benghazi scandal, which took place on Clinton’s watch as secretary of state and has haunted her political career ever since. House Republicans have spent years investigating the terrorist attacks, which killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, and grilled Clinton about her response to the incident in a memorable made-for-TV hearing last fall.\nThe hearing was Washington political theater at its finest. One week before Clinton was slated to testify, Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, said on FOX News that the investigation was politically motivated. “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a special Benghazi committee,” McCarthy said, and “what are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.” At the hearing, Republicans struggled \nDoc 4(Title: Trump or Clinton: how would other countries have voted?) \nTake a moment to imagine that the US election was not decided exclusively by American voters, but was a global election open to every country on the planet.\n\nWhich candidate would be stepping into the White House?

In India, more than two thirds of those surveyed would support Clinton, while 15% didn’t know who they would vote for.\n\nThailand was one of the countries with the most people unsure who they would vote for, with 35% saying so. Malaysia and Saudi Arabia were even more uncertain, with 39% and 46% saying they didn’t know.\n\nAustralia, Hong Kong and the Philippines were strongly in favour of Clinton, registering between 60 and 65% support.\n\n##### Have you read?\n\n*   ##### [5 things US millennials will look for in their next president](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/5-things-millennials-will-look-for-in-their-next-president)\n    \n*   ##### [Would you let an algorithm choose the next US president?](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/would-you-let-an-algorithm-choose-the-next-us-president)\n    \n*   ##### [Student loans are crippling young Americans and the economy.

In addition to the weighting to generate the candidate preference and party affiliation scenarios, the surveys are weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, education and many other characteristics.3 This kind of weighting, which is common practice among polling organizations, helps ensure that the sample matches the population on characteristics that may be related to the opinions people hold.) The simulation takes advantage of the fact that our principal source of data on public opinion is the American Trends Panel, a set of more than 10,000 randomly selected U.S. adults who have agreed to take regular online surveys from us. We conducted surveys with these same individuals approximately twice per month in 2020, with questions ranging across politics, religion, news consumption, economic circumstances, technology use, lifestyles and many more topics. For this analysis, we chose a set of 48 survey questions representing a wide range of important topics on nine different surveys conducted during 2020.\nAfter the November election, we asked our panelists if they voted, and if so, for whom. We also collect a measure of party affiliation for all panelists, regardless of their voter status. With this information, we can manipulate the share of Biden vs. Trump voters in each poll, and Democrats vs. Republicans among nonvoters, and look back at their responses to surveys earlier in the year to gauge how our reading of public opinion on issues differs in the two versions.\nBefore describing the results in more detail, it’s important to be explicit about the assumptions underlying this exercise. We can manipulate the share of voters for each presidential candidate and the share of Democrats and Republicans among nonvoters, but the results may not tell the full story if the Trump and Biden voters in our surveys do not accurately represent their voters in the population. For example, if believers of the internet conspiracy theories known as QAnon are a much higher share of Trump voters in the population than in our panel, that could affect how well our simulation reflects the impact of changing the number of Trump voters. The same is true for our adjustments of the relative shares of Democrats and Republicans. If the partisans in our panel do not accurately reflect the partisans in the general public, we may not capture the full impact of over- or underrepresenting one party or the other.\nHow much can the balance of these two scenarios affect measures of opinion on issues?\nThe adjustment from the tilted version (a 12-point Biden advantage with a 10-point Democratic advantage in party affiliation among nonvoters) to the balanced version (a 4.4-point Biden advantage with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans among nonvoters), makes very little difference in the balance of opinion on issue questions. Across a set of 48 opinion questions and 198 answer categories, most answer categories changed less than 0.5%. The average change associated with the adjustment was less than 1 percentage point, and approximately twice that for the margin between alternative answers (e.g., favor minus oppose). The maximum change observed across the 48 questions was 3 points for a particular answer and 5 points for the margin between alternative answers.\nOne 3-point difference was on presidential job approval, a measure very strongly associated with the vote. In the balanced version, 39 percent approved of Trump’s job performance, while 58 percent disapproved. In the tilted version, 36 percent approved of Trump’s performance and 60 percent disapproved. Two other items also showed a 3-point difference on one of the response options. In the b\nDoc 2(Title: George Orwell famously wrote, “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” So it is with America’s voters. The outcome of today’s election is in the hands of those voters lucky enough to live in a battleground state.) But even these voters are not equal. A few of the battleground states are crucial, others less so. So which battleground states are which? And when, due to the unprecedented level of mail-in balloting, can we expect to know their outcomes?\nAt the top of the list are Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Florida alone could be the tip-off to the identity of the next president. It’s been on the winning side in 13 of the last 14 presidential elections, losing out only in the 1992 Bill Clinton-George H. W. Bush race. President Donald Trump won Florida by a mere 1 percentage point in 2016. Given that he’s behind by a larger margin in national polls this time, Trump likely has to win Florida again to have a chance of victory. Florida’s outcome could be known tonight or by early tomorrow morning. Unlike some states, Florida allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start before Election Day, and such ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted.\nWisconsin is another battleground state that’s more equal than others. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden were to carry Wisconsin, which Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016, he likely will carry the neighboring battleground states of Michigan and Minnesota. They split in 2016, with Hillary Clinton winning narrowly in Minnesota, Trump narrowly in Michigan. But, compared with Wisconsin’s voters, the voters in these two states lean more Democratic. Wisconsin is probably a must-win for Trump, but we might not know its outcome until late next week. Because of a Supreme Court ruling last week, only mail-in ballots received by Election Day will be counted in Wisconsin. Yet, its counting can’t start until Election Day and the state is not equipped to quickly tabulate large numbers of mail-in votes.\nPennsylvania has been a toss-up state in nearly every presidential election since 1976. Trump won by fewer than 50,000 votes in 2016 — this in a state where more than 6 million ballots were cast. Pennsylvania is nearly a must-win state for Biden and he’s in a stronger position there than Clinton was in 2016. Like Wisconsin, it might be late next week before we know the outcome in Pennsylvania. It has a high rate of mail-in balloting, and the count of these ballots can’t begin until Election Day. If the race in Pennsylvania is tight, a legal fight is certain. The Supreme Court declined to make a final decision on a ruling of Pennsylvania’s high court that the state could count ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 and received three days later. The late arriving ballots, for the moment, will be counted separately.\nArizona and North Carolina are in my next tier of important battleground states. Arizona is a new entry into the key battleground-state category. Once safely Republican, it has been trending Democratic due to its increasing Latino population. Unless it’s very close, Arizona’s outcome should be known early. Its mail-in votes can be counted as they arrive. If Trump were to lose Arizona, he likely would have to outperform expectations in the Rust Belt to pull off an Electoral College victory.\nFor its part, North Carolina is another state that Trump likely needs to win. It has gone Republican in four of the last five elections — the exception was 2008, when Barack Obama narrowly edged John McCain. Like Florida, North Carolina could provide an early indicator of the next president. It allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start in advance of Election Day.\nIn the lowest tier of this year’s battleground states are Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Texas. They’re what I would call the “gravy” category. If a combination of these states votes contrary to its recent history, we’re looking at either a lopsided Biden win or, if Trump wins, t\nDoc 3(Title: eace.)

He served as an elector for Connecticut in the Electoral College during the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election. He recently discussed the issues surrounding the Electoral College with UConn Today.\nAfter the George W. Bush win over Al Gore in 2000, there was a lot of discussion about changing the presidential election to a direct popular vote, which would require a constitutional amendment. Were there ever any serious efforts for acting on such a change?\nPrior to 2000, there had been several relatively minor incidents that had generated some discussion. For example, in 1968, there was a Republican elector in North Carolina who voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon; in 1976, a Ford elector voted for Ronald Reagan; and in 1988, a Dukakis elector voted for Lloyd Bensten for president. At the time of the 1968 vote, there was a lot of discussion in Congress when the electoral votes were counted, as to whether to allow that vote. It was allowed, but subsequently Sen. Birch Bayh [Democrat] of Indiana chaired several hearings with discussion of several options: get rid of the Electoral College, have states cast their electoral votes but in proportion to the popular vote, or just forbid the faithless elector that you saw in North Carolina. Nothing came of it.\nIs there a provision in the Electoral College process to prevent someone from voting against the way they were elected to vote by their party?\nConnecticut and several other states have a law on the books that say you must cast your vote for the person to whom you are pledged. That law is of somewhat dubious constitutionality in terms of whether the state can pass a law that deals with the action of a federal official. It’s never been put to the test. Moreover, there are no penalties spelled out in the law. In Connecticut, interestingly, you’re supposed to get $10 when you cast your vote as an elector. I guess you could not get your $10, but beyond that there is no provision.\nWe’ve now seen this situation happen twice in recent years, where the person who received the most popular votes lost because of electoral votes. What is the possibility that this kind of thing can occur on a regular basis?\nThere is a pretty good possibility. The Electoral College biases the system in favor of the Republicans now, because the Democrats tend to win in the larger states. You get electoral votes based on the number of federal representatives – the number of members of the House, plus the number of members of the Senate. The smaller states get that bonus. That helped George W. Bush, and now Donald Trump. The smaller states, who get two bonus votes because of their two senators, are more often Republican. Trump carried 30 states and Hillary carried 20. Trump thus got 20 more electors that way. That’s how Bush won, but it’s not the only way Trump won.\nCurrently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the po\nDoc 5(Title: Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand voters’ views on the 2024 presidential election, as well how the public views President Joe Biden. For this analysis, we surveyed 8,709 adults – including 7,166 registered voters – from April 8 to April 14, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.) Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, American voters face a similar set of choices as they did four years ago – and many are not happy about it.\nWith the election still more than six months away, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that the presidential race is virtually tied: 49% of registered voters favor Donald Trump or lean toward voting for him, while 48% support or lean toward Joe Biden.\nA defining characteristic of the contest is that voters overall have little confidence in either candidate across a range of key traits, including fitness for office, personal ethics and respect for democratic values.\nWhere Trump has the advantage: More than a third of voters say they are extremely or very confident that Trump has the physical fitness (36%) and mental fitness (38%) needed to do the job of president.\nFar fewer say the same of Biden (15% are at least very confident in his physical fitness; 21% are extremely or very confident in his mental fitness). Majorities say they are not too or not at all confident in Biden’s physical and mental fitness.\nWhere Biden has the advantage: More voters are extremely or very confident in Biden (34%) than in Trump (26%) to act ethically in office. And while 38% say they are at least very confident in Biden to respect the country’s democratic values, fewer (34%) express that level of confidence in Trump. The survey was conducted before the start of Trump’s “hush money” trial in New York City.\n(Read more about voters’ views of Biden and Trump in Chapter 2.)\nThe state of the 2024 presidential race\nThe new Center survey of 8,709 adults – including 7,166 registered voters – conducted April 8-14, 2024, finds large divides in voters’ candidate preference by age, education, and race and ethnicity. As was the case in 2020, younger voters and those with a four-year college degree are more likely to favor Biden than Trump.\nOlder voters and those with no college degree favor Trump by large margins.\nAmong racial and ethnic groups:\n- White voters favor Trump (56%) over Biden (42%) by a wide margin.\n- Roughly three-quarters of Black voters (77%) support Biden, while 18% back Trump.\n- Hispanic voters are more evenly divided – 52% favor Biden, while 44% back Trump.\n- Asian voters favor Biden (59%) over Trump (36%).\n(Read more about voters’ candidate preferences in Chapter 1.)\nMost voters who turned out in 2020 favor the same candidate in 2024. Among validated 2020 voters, overwhelming majorities of those who cast ballots for Biden (91%) and Trump (94%) support the same candidate this year. Registered voters who did not vote in 2020 are about evenly divided: 48% back Trump, while 46% support Biden.\nA majority of voters say “it really matters who wins” the 2024 race. Today, 69% of voters say it really matters which candidate wins the presidential contest this November. This is somewhat smaller than the share who said this in April 2020 about that year’s election (74%). Nearly identical shares of Biden’s and Trump’s supporters say the outcome of the presidential race really matters.\nAbout half of voters would replace both Biden and Trump on the 2024 ballot\nReflecting their dissatisfaction with the Biden-Trump\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems there isn't a clear-cut pattern showing a definitive decline or rise in Republican electoral chances following a Democratic presidency.

What our modern-day two-term presidents can tell us\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were all reelected for vastly different reasons. What matters is that they all won second terms. It's also worth pointing out, as we look to 2020, that they all beat opponents who were not particularly strong candidates.\nOur modern two-term trio also suggests another reality of presidential politics: Even as our politics at the congressional level and in the media reflect severe polarization, volatility and partisanship, it may well be that Americans look to the presidency as a kind of port in the storm, a stable refuge from the uncertainty and chaos of our otherwise dysfunctional politics.\nDespite taking a battering over the years, especially during the 1960s and 1970s, the office of presidency still represents what's left of our affinity and allegiance to national symbols and values embodied in an office and in an individual -- the only elected official whom we can all vote for. Whether it's Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, Bush with his megaphone at Ground Zero or Obama in the wake of the Charleston shootings, we look to our presidents to lead, console, inspire and guide us through trauma and crisis.\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were nowhere near achieving undeniable greatness in the presidency. Indeed, they were all flawed and imperfect leaders. Still, when considering a second term, Americans seemed willing to forgive their flaws, favor their strengths over their liabilities and make allowances for their transgressions.\nWhether it's risk-aversion, inertia or any number of rationalizations among voters for not making a change midstream, the last quarter-century has demonstrated a remarkable stability in the presidency.\nSo what does this stability -- unseen for over two centuries -- say about the prospects for a fourth consecutive two-termer? The whole idea of making predictions a year-plus before an election is perilous -- even during ordinary times. And we are not living in anything remotely resembling ordinary times.\nThe power of Trump's incumbency is uncharted territory\nAs an incumbent, Trump carries unprecedented advantages. A strong economy and a nation secure from foreign threats extricating itself from foreign wars adds to that advantage. But what of the idea of the presidency as a source of stability, continuity and unity -- a place of leadership in tune with the best of America's norms and values?\nWhatever their failings -- and there were many, particularly Clinton's behavior with a presidential intern -- Donald Trump's three predecessors saw the office of the presidency as something greater than themselves, a national trust of sorts. They too encountered much of the partisanship and climate of conspiracy that helped fuel Trump's rise. But they never exploited it as a strategy and governing principle; and never departed -- certainly never as egregiously and selfishly as Trump has -- from their role as unifiers and custodians of the values of the office.\nIf the presidency remains a source of comfort and stability, a place of unity and a high ground for Americans despite all that divides them, Trump has brought precisely the opposite to the office: disruption, disrespect and the delegitimization of longstanding values and norms that have defined the presidency's resilience over the years.\nWill Trump become the first fourth-consecutive two-term president in American history? The answer may well depend on whether enough Americans still value the office of the presidency -- and whether they demand from its occupant a respect for the standards and integrity that generations of Americans have come to expect from their presidents.\nDoc 2(Title: George Orwell famously wrote, “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” So it is with America’s voters. The outcome of today’s election is in the hands of those voters lucky enough to live in a battleground state.) But even these voters are not equal. A few of the battleground states are crucial, others less so. So which battleground states are which? And when, due to the unprecedented level of mail-in balloting, can we expect to know their outcomes?\nAt the top of the list are Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Florida alone could be the tip-off to the identity of the next president. It’s been on the winning side in 13 of the last 14 presidential elections, losing out only in the 1992 Bill Clinton-George H. W. Bush race. President Donald Trump won Florida by a mere 1 percentage point in 2016. Given that he’s behind by a larger margin in national polls this time, Trump likely has to win Florida again to have a chance of victory. Florida’s outcome could be known tonight or by early tomorrow morning. Unlike some states, Florida allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start before Election Day, and such ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted.\nWisconsin is another battleground state that’s more equal than others. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden were to carry Wisconsin, which Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016, he likely will carry the neighboring battleground states of Michigan and Minnesota. They split in 2016, with Hillary Clinton winning narrowly in Minnesota, Trump narrowly in Michigan. But, compared with Wisconsin’s voters, the voters in these two states lean more Democratic. Wisconsin is probably a must-win for Trump, but we might not know its outcome until late next week. Because of a Supreme Court ruling last week, only mail-in ballots received by Election Day will be counted in Wisconsin. Yet, its counting can’t start until Election Day and the state is not equipped to quickly tabulate large numbers of mail-in votes.\nPennsylvania has been a toss-up state in nearly every presidential election since 1976. Trump won by fewer than 50,000 votes in 2016 — this in a state where more than 6 million ballots were cast. Pennsylvania is nearly a must-win state for Biden and he’s in a stronger position there than Clinton was in 2016. Like Wisconsin, it might be late next week before we know the outcome in Pennsylvania. It has a high rate of mail-in balloting, and the count of these ballots can’t begin until Election Day. If the race in Pennsylvania is tight, a legal fight is certain. The Supreme Court declined to make a final decision on a ruling of Pennsylvania’s high court that the state could count ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 and received three days later. The late arriving ballots, for the moment, will be counted separately.\nArizona and North Carolina are in my next tier of important battleground states. Arizona is a new entry into the key battleground-state category. Once safely Republican, it has been trending Democratic due to its increasing Latino population. Unless it’s very close, Arizona’s outcome should be known early. Its mail-in votes can be counted as they arrive. If Trump were to lose Arizona, he likely would have to outperform expectations in the Rust Belt to pull off an Electoral College victory.\nFor its part, North Carolina is another state that Trump likely needs to win. It has gone Republican in four of the last five elections — the exception was 2008, when Barack Obama narrowly edged John McCain. Like Florida, North Carolina could provide an early indicator of the next president. It allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start in advance of Election Day.\nIn the lowest tier of this year’s battleground states are Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Texas. They’re what I would call the “gravy” category. If a combination of these states votes contrary to its recent history, we’re looking at either a lopsided Biden win or, if Trump wins, t\nDoc 3(Title: Clues from the Upcoming California Primary) \nmn indicate that the Republican, not the Democrat, gained vote share from the two-party performance in the primary._\n\n**_Source:_** [_California Secretary of State’s office_](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/prior-elections/)\n\n### Map 1: California House districts\n\n[![Image 4](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images//KDK2018052401-map1_600.png)](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images//KDK2018052401-map1.png)\n\n**_Source:_** [_National Atlas_](https://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/congress.html#ca)\n\n**The general rule in California is that one would expect the primary turnout to be more Republican-leaning than the general election.** The reason is the same reason why one might expect that in other parts of the country: The Republican electorate is older and whiter, two demographic factors that generally predict more reliable voter turnout. This year, we’ll probably see something similar: _Politico_ [reported](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/23/california-republicans-cox-midterms-603407) that 32% of the roughly 650,000 returned absentee ballots have been from registered Republicans according to the nonpartisan California data source Political Data, a turnout that is outpacing statewide Republican registration, which is about 25%. **That the primary electorate likely will be more Republican than the general electorate is an additional wrinkle that could hurt Democratic chances to advance candidates to November in one or more of the aforementioned districts.**\n\nOf the three elections held under the top-two, 2012 provides the best example of a more Republican-leaning primary electorate. While 2012 was a presidential year, the California primary wasn’t held until early June, long after Mitt Romney had effectively locked up the Republican presidential nomination (and incumbent President Barack Obama did not have a major challenger on the Democratic side). **Turnout was just** [**22.5% statewide**](http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2016-primary/05-historical-voter-reg-primary.pdf)**, and the electorate seemed Republican-leaning, considering that the Democratic share of the two-party vote increased in nearly every district from the June primary to the November general election**, as Table 2 makes clear. Overall, the total Democratic share of the two-party vote grew by an average of about six percentage points in each district, or a whopping 12 points in terms of margin. That immense growth, combined with new House districts, allowed Democrats to net four seats statewide, going from 34 to 38 seats overall. Democrats did suffer an embarrassing top-two shutout in CA-31, a district that Obama would go on to carry by 17 points. Then-Rep. Gary Miller (R) seemed like a goner, but he and another Republican advanced to the general election over a splintered field of Democrats that included Pete Aguilar (D). Aguilar would go on to win the seat in 2014, a rare Democratic bright spot in what was mostly a bad year otherwise. It’s worth noting, too, that Miller and the other Republican won 51.5% of the two-party vote in the 2012 CA-31 primary, yet another indicator of the Republican lean of that year’s California primary electorate.\n\nTwo years later, **Democratic strength again generally grew from June to November, although not by as much as 2012 and not as consistently across districts.** This makes some sense because Democratic turnout was weak all over the country in 2014, including in California: total votes in the state’s governorship race fell from about 10.1 million in 2010 to 7.3 million in 2014. Despite the weak turnout, and despite some close calls, Democrats did not lose any seats in California and, as mentioned above, Aguilar won CA-31, although not by a lot, creating the party’s current 39-14 majority in the state’s congressional delegation. CA-25, an open Republican seat, saw two Republicans advance to the general election, including now-Rep. \nDoc 4(Title:  lowest tier of this year’s battleground states are Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Texas. They’re what I would call the “gravy” category. If a combination of these states votes contrary to its recent history, we’re looking at either a lopsided Biden win or, if Trump wins, the greatest election comeback since Harry S. Truman beat Thomas Dewey in 1948. Each of these states allows the count of absentee and mail-in ballots to start before Election Day.) As for the 36 states not in this election’s battleground category, there should not be much suspense aside from the speed with which their ballots are counted. There could be a shocking outcome in one or two of these states but it appears unlikely at this point. If the electoral votes of the 36 non-battleground states (and the District of Columbia, which has three electoral votes) are allocated based on current polls, Trump has 130 votes locked up and Biden has 202. A total of 270 electoral votes are needed for victory.\nWhat’s the likelihood that 2020 will repeat 2016, when the national popular vote winner lost the presidency due to the Electoral College? If the most recent national polls are accurate, the odds are relatively high that Trump will be a one-term president. The larger the national popular vote margin, the less likely that the weaker candidate will have a path to an electoral vote victory.\nThomas E.

Sanders refused to formally concede before the convention.[268] He spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. He responded, \"Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton ... It is easy to boo, but it is harder to look your kids in the face if we are living under a Trump presidency.\"[269]\nOn November 8, in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in Vermont, even though he was no longer a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a write-in draft campaign in American history.[270] He also received more votes in Vermont than Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, and Jill Stein, the Green candidate, combined.[271] It was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states,[272] and exact totals of write-in votes for him were published in three of them: California,[273] New Hampshire,[274] and Vermont.[271] In those three states, he received 111,850 write-in votes, about 15% of the write-in votes nationwide, and less than 1% of total nationwide vote.[272]\nPost-election activities\nIn November 2016, Sanders's book Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In was released; upon its release, it was number three on The New York Times Best Seller list.[275] The audiobook later received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.[276] In February 2017, he began webcasting The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook live streaming. As of April 2, 2017[update], guests had included William Barber, Josh Fox, Jane Mayer, and Bill Nye.[277][278] Polls taken in 2017 found him to be the most popular politician in the United States.[217][279]\nIn February 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US elections concluded that Russians had communicated false information during the primary campaigns to help Sanders and Stein and harm Clinton.[280] Sanders rejected the investigation's conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign.[281] Furthermore, he questioned the Clinton campaign's lack of action to prevent Russian interference.[281] He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign.[282] Politico noted that a Sanders campaign volunteer contacted a political action committee (PAC) that supported the Clinton campaign to report suspicious activities but that the Sanders campaign did not contact the Clinton campaign as such.[282]\nIn November 2018, the Sanders Institute and Yanis Varoufakis, co-founder of DiEM25, launched Progressive International, an international organization uniting progressive activists and organizations \"to mobilize people around the world to transform the global order and the institutions that shape it.\"[283][284][285]\nInfluence on the Democratic Party\nAnalysts have suggested that Sanders's campaign shifted both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party politically leftward.

Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.[344][345] Defining what \"democratic socialism\" means to him, Sanders said: \"I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down.

The three richest men in America attended Trump's second inauguration, and Elon Musk's formation of DOGE, as well as the enactment of Project 2025, were seen as myopic and unconstitutional, featuring policies such as reducing taxes on corporations and capital gains, instituting a flat income tax on individuals,[462] cutting Medicare and Medicaid,[463][464] reversing President Joe Biden's policies, and reducing environmental protections.[465][466] After Trump won the election, Sanders released a statement blaming the Democratic Party's abandonment of \"working-class people\" for its defeat.[467] In February 2025, Sanders began the \"Fighting Oligarchy Tour\", in which he and Ocasio-Cortez held rallies criticizing Trump's policies and economic inequality.[468][469] In April 2025, Sanders criticized the administration, saying that its moving \"rapidly toward oligarchy\", he also called US a \"pseudo-democracy\".[470]\nAt one rally held in June 2025, Sanders reacted to news of Trump's bombing of Iranian nuclear sites by saying: \"The American people are being lied to again today. We cannot allow history to repeat itself\".[471][472] Also in June, Sanders endorsed progressive politician and DSA member Zohran Mamdani for the 2025 New York City Democratic mayoral primary, calling him \"best choice\" for mayor.[473] In September 2025, Sanders criticized Democratic Party officials for their perceived refusal to support Mamdani after his victory in the New York City mayoral primary.[474] In the same month, Sanders gave an interview to Mamdani in which they discussed Sanders's political beginnings and his achievements as a mayor and senator.[475] On September 15, 2025, Sanders said that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, becoming the first US senator to make such comment.[476]\nParty affiliations\nBorn into a Democratic-voting family, Sanders was first introduced to political activism when his brother Larry joined the Young Democrats of America and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1956.[477] Sanders joined Vermont's Liberty Union Party in 1971 and was a candidate for several offices, never coming close to winning election. He became party chairman,[478] but quit in 1977 to become an independent.[479] In 1980, he served as an elector for the Socialist Workers Party.[480][481] In 1981, Sanders ran as an independent for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and defeated the Democratic incumbent; he was reelected three times.[81] Although an independent, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidates Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988. His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that \"if you go around saying that Mondale would be a great president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite\"), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically.[482] The Washington Post reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.[482][3]\nSanders attended the 1983 conference of the Socialist Party USA where he gave a speech.[483]\nSanders first ran for the US House of Representatives in 1988 and for the US Senate in 2006, often adopting a strategy of winning the Democratic Party primary, thereby eliminating Democratic challengers, and then running as an independent in the general election.[484] He continued this strategy through his reelection in the 2018 United States Senate election in Vermont.[485] Throughout his tenure in Congress, he has been listed as an independent. He ca\nDoc 4(Title: that followed, Clinton won diverse states and Sanders carried predominantly white ones. The racial divide was startling. During one stretch in late March and early April, when Sanders won seven consecutive contests, the Democratic electorate in the states that he carried was on average 72 percent white. And the gender gap in white states remained constant. Sanders won the male vote by 29 points in Wisconsin, and 19 points in West Virginia, to name just two examples. Sanders developed a loyal following, but it mainly consisted of young people, including a vanguard of “Bernie Bros,” and older white men.) Ryan Geiser, an ardent Sanders supporter, takes a break from work in downtown Pittsburgh. Geiser says he believes Sanders would have fared worse in the primaries if he had faced a white man.\nNot all male Sanders supporters are flagrant sexists, of course. Most aren’t. They responded to Sanders’ economic message and unvarnished campaign trail persona. He successfully cast himself as an outsider candidate despite his decades-long career in Congress, which is no small feat. The 74-year-old socialist senator from Vermont turned out to be a much better fundraiser than anybody expected. Bernie struck a nerve. At the same time, it’s not a coincidence that so many white men chose him over the female alternative.\n“I don’t think there’s any question that there’s gender bias,” said Ryan Geiser, 29, an ardent Sanders supporter from Bellevue, Pa. Geiser, who is white, said that he didn’t base his decision on gender, but knows plenty of Sanders supporters who did. “If Sanders had gone up against a man who had the same politics as Hillary, he wouldn’t have done as well because more white men would have voted for the other guy.” There is strong evidence that subconscious bias shaped the way white men viewed Clinton in the primaries. So just imagine how much sexism could impact the general election, now that Clinton is running against Donald Trump.\nIn late May, I interviewed a group of five white men who get together each afternoon at the Mountaineer Cafe in Berlin, in southwestern Pennsylvania. The day we met at the diner, where a cup of coffee costs $1.55 and comes with a view of the main intersection in town, a light rain was falling outside. Don Williams, a 91-year-old retired welder, and Max Bowser, who is 75 and worked as a truck driver, were the first to arrive. They were soon joined by Elmer Altfather, 83, a retired carpenter; Ted Robb, 80, who worked for a railroad company; and Larry Pritts, 75, a retired heavy equipment operator and former member of Berlin’s town council. The longtime friends are split along party lines: two are Democrats, and three are Republicans.\n“Donald Trump scares me,” Bowser, who is a Republican, said as our conversation got underway. “But we need a change, and I’m willing to give someone the right to change it.”\nWilliams, who is also conservative, and has followed the election closely despite his advanced age, chimed in: “We need a big boom.”\n“Yeah,” said Bowser. “But not Hillary. I don’t like the way she lies. They’ve caught her in so many lies.”\nBowser, like nearly every Republican voter I interviewed for this story, pointed to the Benghazi scandal, which took place on Clinton’s watch as secretary of state and has haunted her political career ever since. House Republicans have spent years investigating the terrorist attacks, which killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, and grilled Clinton about her response to the incident in a memorable made-for-TV hearing last fall.\nThe hearing was Washington political theater at its finest. One week before Clinton was slated to testify, Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, said on FOX News that the investigation was politically motivated. “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a special Benghazi committee,” McCarthy said, and “what are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.” At the hearing, Republicans struggled \nDoc 5(Title: pokeswoman Briahna Joy Gray falsely claimed that Mike Bloomberg had also \"suffered heart attacks in the past.\"[67] Gray later issued a statement saying she had misspoken: \"I misspoke when I said Bloomberg had a heart attack.

Bernie released 3 detailed medical reports in December — just like the other candidates.\"[68]) Iowa and Nevada caucuses\n[edit]Following his winning the popular vote in the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses, the popular vote and delegate count in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, and a significant surge in national polls, Sanders emerged as a front-runner in the 2020 primaries.[69][70] Sanders surpassed Joe Biden in the RealClearPolitics average for the first time ever on February 10, 2020. Some more moderate Democrats have expressed concerns that a Sanders nomination could cause a down-ballot effect favoring Republican candidates,[71][72][73] while others have argued that a progressive nominee such as Sanders could benefit from a greater turnout of young and historically disenfranchised voters.[74] Congressional Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have both indicated they would be comfortable with Sanders at the top of the ticket, and attempted to allay fears about Sanders' influence down-ballot.[75]\nSanders has faced criticism for the toxic online behavior of some of his supporters, especially following the Culinary Workers Union's decision not to endorse him. The union claimed that this was in part due to online harassment union leaders received from Sanders supporters after distributing a flyer criticizing Sanders's healthcare policy.[76] At the Democratic debate on February 19, Sanders suggested that such behavior represents only a small fraction of his base and that some of his alleged online supporters may be Russian bots.[77][78] A spokesperson for Twitter said there was no evidence backing Sanders's claim.[78] On February 22, it was reported that Russia had been attempting to interfere in the primaries to support Sanders. In response, Sanders denounced Russian election interference, stating, \"If elected president, trust me, [Putin is] not going to be interfering in American elections.\"[79] He said that his campaign was briefed about Russia's alleged efforts about a month before.[79] The following day, Sanders won the Nevada caucuses.[80] Sanders once again condemned Putin at the Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina, on February 25.[81] In February 2020, he temporarily became the race's front-runner.[82][83][84][85]\nSuper Tuesday and subsequent voting\n[edit]Shortly before Super Tuesday, Biden won the South Carolina primary, a victory that was largely attributed to Rep. Jim Clyburn's (D-SC) endorsement of him. Biden also received multiple key endorsements of former 2020 Democratic primary competitors, adding to his momentum. Following Biden attaining the lead in the election during the Super Tuesday primaries, Sanders said he would drop out if Biden ends up having more pledged delegates than him by the time of the 2020 Democratic National Convention in July, eliminating the need for superdelegate intervention in the event of a contested convention.[86][87]\nOne week after Super Tuesday, the Michigan primary, which in 2016 gave the Sanders campaign a critical boost, was a decisive victory for Biden.[88] The North Dakota primary was the sole victory for Sanders on the week after Super Tuesday. On March 14, Sanders won the Northern Mariana Islands caucuses, a minor contest awarding him 4 delegates.\nThe day after the March 17 primaries, in which Biden won all three states by wide margins, Sanders said his team was \"assessing the state of our campaign\" but that it would not be ending.[89] The campaign later deactivated its Facebook advertisements.[90] Aides to both his and Biden's campaign said they were in contact with one another regarding the coronavirus pandemic,[89] which caused many of the upcoming primaries to be postpo\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems Bernie Sanders would likely lose to Trump in a general election scenario.

His confirmation hearings will provide greater insight into the way he views the Russians and America’s role in the world, more generally.) Let's address the Russian hacking matter. First, the recent intelligence community report concluded that Russia was, in fact, behind the cyber-attacks on the Republican National Committee (RNC), the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and operatives’ emails. The report, a consensus document, prepared by the CIA, NSA, and FBI concluded: “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”\nConsidering the Russian government, just like any other foreign government who sees the United States as an adversary, engages in regular cyber-attacks, it takes very little to persuade me that it was the Russians behind the hacks.\nNote, however, that the motives, agreed to by the three intelligence agencies, were not to elect Donald Trump. Analysis that said so would hardly make sense. According to the Wall Street Journal, the techniques used to infiltrate the DNC were also used in an attempt to infiltrate the RNC, only the RNC’s security measures blocked the attempts. Moreover, the timing of the security breaches also work against the theory that the original motivations were to help Donald Trump. The first breach took place in the summer of 2015, the second in April of 2016. Recall, Donald Trump didn’t even officially win the Republican nomination until July 2016. It makes a lot more sense that the Russians, like nearly everyone else on Planet Earth, believed Hillary Clinton would win the election, and they were busy digging up damaging information to weaken and use as leverage against her.\nThe intelligence community also revealed high-level Russians cheered upon learning Donald Trump won the election. Much could be said about this, but, in short, some Russians cheered President Obama’s election, and the Community Party USA backed Hillary Clinton. In other words, it means nothing.\nThe President-elect has been notably defensive about the conclusions of the intelligence community, so what about that? Does it at least imply he is defensive of the Russian government and naive to an alarming degree about the nature of the Russians’ desire to cause upheaval in the American democratic process? After President-elect Trump received a personal briefing from the intelligence agencies, he responded: \"While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat [sic] National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.” Those are not the words of someone who seems to be clueless about the constant cyber attacks adversaries launch against the United States—including Russia. They are the words of someone who is keenly aware that the media and those insufferably determined to look at the incoming Trump administration with as little charity as possible are using the Russian cyber-attacks to delegitimize the American election outcome.\nThe Obama administration started its first term speaking positively about Russia; it was willing to capitulate on matters important to Russia in an effort to appease it (i.e. the U.S. missile defense system); it powered through with the nuclear arms reduction treaty, New START, even though there is evidence it did so while concealing to Congress that Russia was in violation, and remains in violation, of a\nDoc 2(Title: te on matters important to Russia in an effort to appease it (i.e. the U.S. missile defense system); it powered through with the nuclear arms reduction treaty, New START, even though there is evidence it did so while concealing to Congress that Russia was in violation, and remains in violation, of another arms control treaty, the INF Treaty and engages in nuclear saber-rattling; it paid little notice to the Russians harassing U.S. diplomats; it allowed Russia to harass the U.S. Navy in international waters; and it permitted Russia to protect and empower the dictator Bashar al-Assad and partake in the brutal onslaught of the Syrian people, to name just a few.) It’s little wonder the incoming President might be resisting the lame-duck President’s efforts to make this Russian infraction the one that calls Russia out as a true enemy.\nNow, let’s address the rhetoric from Trump regarding Russia and its leaders. Trump has called Putin a leader for his country and has accepted Putin’s compliments directed at him.\nEach statement directed towards Putin is worth examining, but, for example, Trump got members of the anti-Trump intelligentsia really clutching their pearls when he quipped, \"Russia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by the press.\"\nThe response from Camp Clinton was remarkable. Jake Sullivan, Clinton’s chief foreign policy adviser, said, “This has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national security issue.” But, many of us who followed Clinton’s shameful and illegal handling of highly classified documents and her mysteriously disappearing 30,000-plus emails wondered, “If those emails were harmless, why would Russia finding them create a national security issue?”\nOr, put another way, as Charles Krauthammer observed, “Whether or not [Trump] made [the Russia comments] seriously or not, could have been sarcastic or sort of half sarcastic as a way to plant the idea. The fact is that it leaves the Clinton campaign in a complete contradiction. If these are just private e-mails, then there is nothing to be concerned about. There’s no espionage. There is no danger to national security. I mean, they will discover her yoga lesson schedule.” Indeed.\nEach one of Trump’s statements regarding Russia has been relatively cordial, it’s true.\nBut, whether intentionally or not, some of them, especially this one, appears to have another political meaning, and effect. But, to be sure, categorically none of the comments rises to level of evidence that America’s new Commander in Chief seeks a grand alliance with Moscow. Is it possible, then, if one takes Trump’s statements toward and about Russia within the context of Trump’s overarching themes regarding what America’s standing in the world ought to be and with full view of his stated foreign policy goals, that Trump is doing something far more clever than what people give him credit for? I think so. And that brings me to the last point.\nTrump has consistently argued for investing in and modernizing America’s military. Most importantly, he has identified the employment of nuclear weapons as a major threat he would like to avoid, and recently stated, \"The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”\nHe is absolutely right. The United States has been lowering the number of its nuclear weapons for decades in the hopes that other countries would be motivated to eschew nuclear strength as well. In addition, the United States has allowed its nuclear force to age without adequate modernization. All three legs of the triad—submarines, missiles, and bombers—are due for serious refurbishment if they are to remain safe and offer a credible deterrent. What has kept the United States from maintaining and improving its nuclear force? Fear of provoking the Russian Federation.

A spokesman for Putin denied the reports.[289] Putin has repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton, who served as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 of interfering in Russia's internal affairs,[290] and in December 2016, Clinton accused Putin of having a personal grudge against her.[291][292]\nWith the election of Trump, Putin's favorability in the U.S. increased. A Gallup poll in February 2017 revealed a positive view of Putin among 22% of Americans, the highest since 2003.[293] Putin has stated that U.S.–Russian relations, already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War,[294] have continued to deteriorate after Trump took office in January 2017.[295]\nOn 18 June 2020, The National Interest published a nine-thousand-word essay by Putin, titled \"The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II\".[296] In the essay, Putin criticizes the Western historical view of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as the start of World War II, stating that the Munich Agreement was the beginning.[297]\nOn 21 February 2023, Putin suspended Russia's participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.[298] On 25 March, President Putin announced the stationing of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Russia would maintain control of the weapons. President Putin told Russian TV: \"There is nothing unusual here either. Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer\nGetting along with Russia, as then-candidate Donald J. Trump suggested, would indeed be a good thing. But, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama tried and failed; US-Russian relations are not much better under Trump, and Russia is not on especially good terms with Europe either.\nDealing with Russia “as it is,” as some capable Russia experts (including the authors’ former colleagues) recommend in their “open letter” urging that the United States rethink its Russia policy, sounds unarguably realistic.2Rose Gottemoeller, et al., “Opinion: It’s Time to Rethink Our Russia Policy,” POLITICO, September 25, 2020, https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/05/open-letter-russia-policy-391434.\nBut, Russia “as it is” is a stagnating authoritarian kleptocracy led by a president-for-life who has started wars against its neighbors, assassinates opponents inside and outside of Russia, interferes in US and European elections, and generally seems to act as an anti-US spoiler at every opportunity. Its leadership expects the West to grant Russia a free hand in “its” half of Europe, and to look the other way when it seeks to deprive its former neighbors—and its own citizens—of the right to chart their own futures.\nThat’s not a great basis for better relations, or for arguing that the United States or the West must take principal responsibility in reaching out to or accommodating Vladimir Putin’s Russia.\nThe authors prefer, however, to think in more hopeful terms about the longer-term potential of Russia’s relations with the world, the West, and the United States. They are realistic about the obstacles, especially in the short run, but do not think that Russia’s relations with the West are permanently stuck in the bad place they are in now, or that “as it is” is Russia’s only possible end state.\nCurrent US-Russian relations are about as bad as they were during the final years of Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union and the first term of the Ronald Reagan administration, a time when many in the United States and Europe believed that the danger of further deterioration—or even war—was real.\nBut, things turned out otherwise—and better. Mikhail Gorbachev followed Brezhnev. His “new thinking” on foreign policy, and Reagan’s constructive response to it, generated a turnabout in US-Soviet relations, and helped create conditions for breakthroughs that ended the Cold War peacefully.\nBoth authors worked on relations with Moscow starting in that more hopeful period, and during the better times that followed during the 1990s. It is instructive to examine what went wrong (and right) and why, including what the United States did wrong, and what the Russians and the West can do to make it better.\nWe must deal with Russia as it is, not as we wish it would be”\nParticipants at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum gathered near an electronic screen showing Russian President Vladimir Putin who addressed a session of the forum in St. Petersburg, Russia, on June 2, 2017.

Of the remaining 35% only 11% would have voted Trump, the rest were undecided.\n\nBut Clinton had the highest backing in the Nordic regions, with levels of support ranging from 72% in Norway to a high of 81% in Denmark, and relatively few undecided.\n\nOther European countries weren’t far behind, almost three quarters of Germans (72%) thought Clinton would make a better president, while 64% of the French agreed.\n\n![Image 1: Who would you rather was president of the USA? %  ](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/mWOx6YRlZnnwxS0ug8Dll64I0pMzSKmRu30XNNmM-Wc.JPG)\n\nImage: YouGov\n\n**Where did Trump have the most support?**\n\nThe real election result is reflected in the results of the survey, which showed the highest support for Trump in the US, at 39%, more than any other country.\n\nOne-fifth of those in Thailand and India were also in favour of a Trump presidency, but with far less support he has in America. In India, more than two thirds of those surveyed would support Clinton, while 15% didn’t know who they would vote for.\n\nThailand was one of the countries with the most people unsure who they would vote for, with 35% saying so.

So, yeah. If the president can\n\npardon himself-- maybe he can, maybe he can't-- but if he can, he can pardon\n\nhimself for treason.\n\n**MICAH**\n\n**SCHWARTZMAN:**\n\nI have a question from the audience. This one is directed to you, Bernie, and it goes\n\nlike this, \"I wonder if you could argue that this is not, in fact, a self-pardon. In\n\nEnglish law, the monarchy possesses a duality-- the mortal and immortal bodies.\n\nCould, potentially, Trump acting in the immortal capacity of the presidency--\" I want\n\nto put, maybe, an asterisk there, but ask about that-- \"--in the immortal capacity of\n\nthe presidency pardon the mortal person of Donald Trump?\" And then, \"Not that I\n\nwant that to happen.\"\n\n**BERNADETTE**\n\n**MEYLER:**\n\nYeah, so that's a really fascinating question. I have two responses to it. One is that--\n\ncertainly in the heyday of this concept of the two bodies of the king, Charles I was\n\ntried and executed by a rough parliament, and he didn't think about pardoning\n\nhimself. So I think if we had had a notion that the immortal kingship could pardon\n\nthe mortal king, that he might have done that.\n\nNow, that might actually bring in a different question, which someone asked also--\n\n\"Would Trump have to admit guilt if he were pardoning himself?\" I think that one of\n\nthe reasons why Charles maybe wouldn't have even thought about pardoning\n\nhimself is that he didn't want to admit that he had done anything wrong. So there's\n\nanother complication there, but if we had this idea of the immortal body of the king\n\npardoning the mortal one, we would have seen it with Charles-- which we didn't.\n\nAnd then, it's maybe, as Micah was flagging, that I'm hesitant about translating that\n\ndual body into the presidency. The most I could think is that maybe the office of the\n\npresidency is actually the immortal body, and then the particular president is the\n\nmortal body. And so my translation of that principle, if we were thinking about the\n\nimmortal body pardoning the mortal, would be to say, well, that's why we have,\n\nmaybe, successor presidents sometimes contemplating pardoning a prior\n\npresident. Because that's the office of the presidency almost pardoning the acts of\n\na particular president.\n\nAnd actually, that goes also to John's point, which was very interesting. The\n\nexample of maybe where we think a self-pardon might be justified of a president,\n\nwhere, in general, in a case like what John was describing, we might imagine it's\n\nambiguous enough that a successor president would just pardon the prior\n\npresident. So we have norms about what's excessive behavior as a president and\n\nwhat isn't, and that we might imagine that within a particular parameter or set of\n\nparameters. A later president wouldn't actually impose the law against a prior one\n\nbecause of this idea that you're trying to ensure peaceful continuity and don't want\n\nto make some kind of political prosecution.\n\nSo I think that's where once we get beyond a certain level of violation of norms,\n\nthen there's a free-for-all about what exactly should happen or what does happen.\n\nSo those are the reasons why I think that the kind of self-pardoning analogy with\n\nthe king's two bodies doesn't quite work in this case. But I think it's really\n\ninteresting.\n\n**MICAH**\n\n**SCHWARTZMAN:**\n\nWe have a bunch of questions that are about the mechanics of the pardon power.\n\nSo I thought we could run through a few of those questions and try to get a better\n\nsense of how the pardon works. These questions aren't, I think, only about self-\n\npardoning, but are about the content of a pardon.\n\nSo one question is, \"Can the president pardon a group of people?\" Bernie\n\nmentioned this question in wondering whether the pardon power has been\n\ninterpreted too broadly. So that's one question we could talk about.\n\nAnd the second question is \"Can the president--\" or more generally, \"does the\n\npardon power apply to unspecified acts? H\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the articles provided, it seems that people have a variety of questions about Trump, especially concerning his policies and actions during his presidency.

January 20: President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, including directing the Department of Defense to allocate personnel to support the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border. It also revoked President Biden’s order that blocked funds from being diverted to border wall construction.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship in direct contradiction to the plain text of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, though the order doesn’t specify how agencies would carry it out. The Department of Justice defended this order in multiple courts.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order that seeks to revise his plan to strip employment protections for federal workers, including by reinstating Schedule F. Tens of thousands of federal civilian workers could lose protection from being arbitrarily fired and potentially replaced with Trump administration loyalists under the schedule F plan, though the order changes “F” to the words “Policy/Career.”\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order to restore the federal death penalty, instructing the attorney general to “pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use” and directs the attorney general to “take all necessary and lawful action” to ensure that states with capital punishment have sufficient access to the drugs needed for lethal injection executions.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order that calls for increased border wall construction, deployment of Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense personnel to the border, and detention. It also reinstates the “Remain in Mexico” program.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order that suspends admissions of refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, subject to a review every 90 days, and revokes a Biden-era executive order on refugee resettlement.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order that defines ‘sex’ in unscientific narrow binary terms, mandates that federal policies and documents align with this definition, and prohibits funding or promotion of so-called “gender ideology.” It also directs agencies to remove references to nonbinary people and prohibit recognition of gender identity differently from sex assigned at birth in a blatant attack on trans people. Many of the actions listed in this order would be in direct conflict with much of the Supreme Court’s opinion in Bostock v. Clayton County, binding precedent interpreting Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex in the workplace. The order also calls on the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Homeland Security to ignore the guidelines of the Prison Rape Elimination Act and enforce a blanket policy forcing transgender women into men’s prisons and detention centers against their will.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order calling for an end to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs, policies, and activities in the federal government. Specifically, it provides a list of federal grantees who received federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or environmental justice programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued a proclamation that commutes the sentences of several people convicted of violent crimes related to the January 6 insurrection and grants “a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.”\n- Read The Leadership Conference’s response here.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order setting up a 60-day wind\nDoc 2(Title:  to one of the president’s first executive orders.

The order made no new policies, but instead directed the Department of Education to respond.\nJanuary 29: The Department of Justice withdrew from an Americans with Disabilities Act case concerning the Utah Department of Corrections’ refusal to treat a transgender person with gender dysphoria who resorted to self-castration while waiting for treatment.\nJanuary 29: President Trump issued an executive order that directs the Department of Education, Department of Defense, and Department of Health and Human Services to come up with plans by March 21 for ending federal funding for so-called “discriminatory equity ideology” (by which they mean valuing diversity, accurate teaching, and inclusive curriculum). Since the Department of Education was first created, there have been legal prohibitions on federal interference in local curricular decisions.

He followed through with a presidential memo on August 25, though the issue is still being challenged in the courts.\nOn July 26, the Department of Justice filed a legal brief arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation – a decision that contravened recent court decisions and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidance.\nOn August 1, The New York Times reported that the “Trump administration is preparing to redirect resources of the Justice Department’s civil rights division toward investigating and suing universities over affirmative action admissions policies deemed to discriminate against white applicants.” In a move without recent precedent, this investigation and enforcement effort was planned to be run out of the Civil Rights Division’s front office by political appointees, instead of by experienced career staff in the division’s educational opportunities section.\nOn August 2, Trump announced his support of Republican-backed legislation that would slash legal immigration in half over a decade.\nOn August 7, the Justice Department filed a brief in the Supreme Court in Husted v.

Overturning the rule will enable big banks, payday lenders, and other financial companies to force victims of fraud, discrimination, or other unlawful conduct into a “kangaroo court” process where their claims are decided by hired arbitration firms rather than by judges and juries – harming consumers and undermining civil rights and consumer protection laws.\nOn November 6, the Trump administration announced it will terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua.\nOn November 14, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy supporting H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposes.

They also voted to eliminate several rules promoting competition and diversity in the broadcast media, undermining ownership chances for women and people of color.\nOn November 20, the Trump administration announced it would terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation in 18 months for approximately 59,000 Haitians living in the United States.\nOn November 24, Trump appointed Mick Mulvaney as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). As a member of Congress, Mulvaney supported abolishing the consumer bureau and has in the past referred to the CFPB as a “sick, sad” joke.\nOn December 4, the Department of Labor proposed changing its longstanding position codified in regulation that prohibited employers from pooling together tips and redistributing them to workers who don’t traditionally earn tips.\nOn December 12, the Department of Justice wrote to acting Census Bureau Director Ron Jarmin requesting a question about citizenship on the 2020 Census.

On May 4, Trump signed an executive order that he claimed overturned the Johnson Amendment (though it did not), which precludes tax-exempt organizations, including places of worship, from engaging in any political campaign activity and would curtail the contraception mandate of the Affordable Care Act.\nOn May 10, Sessions announced in a two-page memo that DOJ was abandoning its Smart on Crime initiative that had been hailed as a positive step forward in rehabilitating drug users and reducing the enormous costs of warehousing inmates.\nOn May 11, Trump signed an executive order creating the so-called Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has a history of trying to suppress the vote in Kansas.\nOn May 23, Trump released his fiscal year 2018 budget that included massive, unnecessary tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations, which would be paid for by slashing basic living standards for the most vulnerable and by attacking critical programs like Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicaid, food assistance, and more.\nOn May 23, Trump’s fiscal year 2018 budget proposed eliminating the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) and transferring its functions to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). This would have impeded the work of both the OFCCP and the EEOC as each have distinct missions and expertise, and would have thereby undermined the civil rights protections that employers and workers have relied on for almost 50 years.\nOn June 5, Trump released an infrastructure plan that focuses on putting public assets into private hands, creating another giveaway to wealthy corporations and millionaires at the expense of working families and communities.\nOn June 6, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued unclear new instructions on transgender student discrimination.\nOn June 8, OCR’s acting head sent a memo to OCR staff discouraging systemic investigations in favor of individual investigations of discrimination.\nOn June 14, DeVos decided to delay implementation of and to renegotiate the Borrower Defense to Repayment and Gainful Employment regulations – important regulations that had been designed to protect students from predatory conduct by for-profit schools.\nOn June 14, the Department of Education withdrew, without explanation, a 2016 finding that an Ohio school district discriminated against a transgender girl.\nOn June 15, the administration rescinded President Obama’s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program, an initiative that – had it gone into effect – would have offered a pathway to citizenship for immigrant parents with children who are citizens or residents of the United States.\nOn June 27, Labor Secretary Acosta requested information on the Obama-era overtime rule, signaling his intent to lower the salary threshold of the overtime rule.\nOn June 27, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy supporting H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposes.\nOn June 27, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy supporting H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, which The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposes.\nOn June 28, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division sent a letter to 44 states demanding extensive information on how they maintain their voter rolls.

The New Testament contains hundreds of references to Jesus Christ. There are those who date the writing of the Gospels to the second century A.D., more than 100 years after Jesusâ death. Even if this were the case (which we strongly dispute), in terms of ancient evidences, writings less than 200 years after events took place are considered very reliable evidences. Further, the vast majority of scholars (Christian and non-Christian) will grant that the Epistles of Paul (at least some of them) were in fact written by Paul in the middle of the first century A.D., less than 40 years after Jesusâ death. In terms of ancient manuscript evidence, this is extraordinarily strong proof of the existence of a man named Jesus in Israel in the early first century A.D.\nIt is also important to recognize that in A.D. 70, the Romans invaded and destroyed Jerusalem and most of Israel, slaughtering its inhabitants. Entire cities were literally burned to the ground. We should not be surprised, then, if much evidence of Jesusâ existence was destroyed. Many of the eyewitnesses of Jesus would have been killed. These facts likely limited the amount of surviving eyewitness testimony of Jesus.\nConsidering that Jesusâ ministry was largely confined to a relatively unimportant area in a small corner of the Roman Empire, a surprising amount of information about Jesus can be drawn from secular historical sources. Some of the more important historical evidences of Jesus include the following:\nThe first-century Roman Tacitus, who is considered one of the more accurate historians of the ancient world, mentioned superstitious âChristiansâ (from Christus, which is Latin for Christ), who suffered under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius. Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote that there was a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century (Annals 15.44).\nFlavius Josephus is the most famous Jewish historian. In his Antiquities he refers to James, âthe brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.â There is a controversial verse (18:3) that says, âNow there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man. For he was one who wrought surprising feats....He was [the] Christ...he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him.â One version reads, âAt this time there was a wise man named Jesus. His conduct was good and [he] was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. But those who became his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive; accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah, concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.â\nJulius Africanus quotes the historian Thallus in a discussion of the darkness that followed the crucifixion of Christ (Extant Writings, 18).\nPliny the Younger, in Letters 10:96, recorded early Christian worship practices including the fact that Christians worshiped Jesus as God and were very ethical, and he includes a reference to the love feast and Lordâs Supper.\nThe Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a) confirms Jesusâ crucifixion on the eve of Passover and the accusations against Christ of practicing sorcery and encouraging Jewish apostasy.\nLucian of Samosata was a second-century Greek writer who admits that Jesus was worshiped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them. He said that Jesusâ teachings included the brotherhood of believers, the importance of conversion, and the importance of denying other gods. Christians live\nDoc 2(Title: 'Did Jesus Exist?' A Historian Makes His Case) Did Jesus Exist?\nSo, did Jesus really exist? With his new book, Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth, Bart Ehrman, historian and professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, wanted to provide solid historical evidence for the existence of Jesus.\n\"I wanted to approach this question as an historian to see whether that's right or not,\" Ehrman tells weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz.\nThe answer is straightforward and widely accepted among scholars of all faiths, but Ehrman says there is a large contingent of people claiming that Jesus never did exist. These people are also known as mythicists.\n\"It was a surprise to me to see how influential these mythicists are,\" Ehrman says. \"Historically, they've been significant and in the Soviet Union, in fact, the mythicist view was the dominant view, and even today, in some parts of the West – in parts of Scandinavia — it is a dominant view that Jesus never existed,\" he says.\nMythicists' arguments are fairly plausible, Ehrman says. According to them, Jesus was never mentioned in any Roman sources and there is no archeological evidence that Jesus ever existed. Even Christian sources are problematic – the Gospels come long after Jesus' death, written by people who never saw the man.\n\"Most importantly,\" he explains, \"these mythicists point out that there are Pagan gods who were said to die and rise again and so the idea is that Jesus was made up as a Jewish god who died and rose again.\"\nIn his book, Ehrman marshals all of the evidence proving the existence of Jesus, including the writings of the apostle Paul.\n\"Paul knew Jesus' brother, James, and he knew his closest disciple, Peter, and he tells us that he did,\" Ehrman says. \"If Jesus didn't exist, you would think his brother would know about it, so I think Paul is probably pretty good evidence that Jesus at least existed,\" he says.\nIn Did Jesus Exist?, Ehrman builds a technical argument and shows that one of the reasons for knowing that Jesus existed is that if someone invented Jesus, they would not have created a messiah who was so easily overcome.\n\"The Messiah was supposed to overthrow the enemies – and so if you're going to make up a messiah, you'd make up a powerful messiah,\" he says. \"You wouldn't make up somebody who was humiliated, tortured and the killed by the enemies.\"\nSo Jesus did exist, but who was he? Ehrman says when historians focus on the life of Jesus, they discover a Jesus who is completely different from the one portrayed by popular culture or by religious texts.\n\"The mythicists have some right things to say,\" Ehrman says. \"The Gospels do portray Jesus in ways that are non-historical.\"\nWhen Raz asks Ehrman about his relationship to Jesus, Ehrman says that most of it is very historical but that Jesus teaches us valuable lessons.\n\"Jesus' teachings of love, and mercy and forgiveness, I think, really should dominate our lives,\" he says. \"On the personal level, I agree with many of the ethical teachings of Jesus and I try to model my life on them, even though I don't agree with the apocalyptic framework in which they were put.\"\nDoc 3(Title: ter the time, that Jesus is supposed to have lived:) According to Remsburg, “Enough of the writings of the authors named in the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish author, and two disputed passages in the works of Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.” Nor, we may add, do any of these authors make note of the Disciples or Apostles – increasing the embarrassment from the silence of history concerning the foundation of Christianity.\nNotes\n- It is sometimes claimed that the “miraculous” spread of Christianity in the early Roman Empire is evidence of an historical Jesus – that such a movement could not have gone so far so fast had there not been a real person at its inception. A similar argument could be made, however, in the case of the earlier rapid spread of Mithraism. I am unaware of any Christian apologists who would argue that this supports the idea of an historical Mithra!\n- A profusely annotated paperback edition of Paine’s book is available from American Atheist Press for twelve dollars. (Order No. 5575, click here) [back]\n- An apocalypse is a pseudonymous piece of writing characterized by exaggerated symbolic imagery, usually dealing with the expectation of an imminent cosmic cataclysm wherein the deity destroys the wicked and rewards the righteous. Apocalyptic writing abounds in hidden meanings and numerological puzzles. Parts of a number of Judæo-Christian apocalypses other than Revelation have been preserved, but only the latter (if one does not consider the Book of Daniel to be entirely apocalyptic) was accepted into the Christian canon – and it almost didn’t make it, having been rejected by several early Church Fathers and Church Councils.\n- The opposite theory, often referred to as “Griesbach’s hypothesis,” that the author of Mark had “epitomized” the two longer gospels, keeping only the “essential” details, is today almost entirely rejected by bible scholars. While the arguments to support this nearly universal rejection are too involved to even summarize here, it may be noted that shortening of miracle stories is completely out of keeping with the principles of religious development seen everywhere today. Stories invariably get “better” (i.e., longer) with the retelling, never shorter!\n- There is compelling evidence indicating that these alleged sayings of Jesus were taken from another early document known as Q (German, for Quelle, ‘source’). Like the so-called Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi in Egypt, Q appears to have been a list of wisdom sayings that at some point became attributed to Jesus. We know that at least one of these sayings (“We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced…” Matt. 17:11; Luke 7:32) derives from Æsop’s Fables, not from a sage of Galilee!\n- I say “official gospels” because there are, in fact, many other gospels known. Once people started making them up, they sort of got stuck in over-drive. Only later on in Christian history did the number get pared back to four.\n- Even the letters supposed to contain authentic writings of Saul/Paul have been shown by a number of scholars to be as composite as the gospels (e.g., L. Gordon Rylands, A Critical Analysis of the Four Chief Pauline Epistles: Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and Galatians, Watts & Co., London, 1929). According to such analyses, the core Pauline material in these letters is what might be termed a pre-Christian Gnostic product. This material is surrounded by often contradictory material added by proto-Catholic interpolators and redactors who succeeded thus in claiming a popular proto-Gnostic authority for the Church of Rome. In any case, the Greek text of these letters is heavy with terms such as Archon, Æon, etc. – jargon terms popular in the more astrologically conscious forms of Gnosticism. It would appear that the Christ of Paul is as astral a being as the Lamb of Revelation. Lik\nDoc 4(Title: Why Doesn't God Do More to Convince Us of His Existence?) The Hiddenness of God\nThe hiddenness of God is often proposed as evidence that God does not exist.1 Atheists who advance this argument can affirm that there may be some evidence that God exists, such as the Big Bang, the fine-tuning of the universe, and the existence of objective moral facts. However, this limited evidence is far less than what we ought to expect. If the Christian God exists and loves us, and if our eternal destiny hangs in the balance, why isn’t the evidence for his existence absolutely undeniable? Surely, a God who could create the entire universe could routinely perform unmistakable miracles, like regularly sending angels to materialize in the center of Times Square in the presence of thousands of witnesses. The absence of such extraordinary evidence is, then, an indication that this kind of God does not exist.\nTo answer this objection, we need to take a deeper look at the biblical doctrine of sin. According to the Bible, sin is not merely the breaking of God’s rules; it stems from our inherent posture of rebellion toward God. To put it another way, if faith is essentially trust in God, then unbelief is essentially mistrust of God. We don’t merely doubt his existence; we doubt his goodness. We distrust his claim that he knows what is best for us and that surrendering to his rule over our lives will bring us joy and freedom. The claim here is not that intellectual objections don’t exist or that they are unimportant, but that they are not the primary obstacle between us and God. As surprising as it might seem, lack of evidence is not the ultimate reason for our unbelief.\nWhy Believe?\nNeil Shenvi\nWhy Believe? engages some of the best contemporary arguments against belief, presenting compelling evidence for the truth of Christianity and calling readers to entrust their lives to Christ.\nA Question after Being Convinced\nIf that claim sounds difficult to accept, a thought experiment might help. Imagine you are about to head to bed when Jesus suddenly appears in the middle of your living room. He shows you the nail prints in his hands and performs miracles, multiplying your avocado toast and fish sticks and turning your tap water into wine. In other words, imagine, for the sake of argument, that he gives you whatever evidence you need to completely convince you intellectually that he is God, that he died on the cross for your sins, and that he rose from the dead. The question I’d like you to consider is not whether you would believe that God exists or that Christianity is true, because we’re granting for the sake of argument that these issues have been settled for you. The question is this: How do you feel about him?\nAt that moment, what if Jesus said to you: “Now that you know that I am God, I am calling you to become my disciple. That means you must take up your cross daily, dying to your own desires and demands, and seeking my will in all your decisions. I must be more important to you than any human relationship and even more important to you than your own life. You must put to death all the sins that you love and that seem so natural to you, even if it feels as difficult as plucking out your right eye or cutting off your right hand. Your money, your friendships, your sex life, your career goals, your entertainment, your entire ethical framework, your view of the Bible—everything must be reevaluated in light of who I am. I want you to devote your whole life to my mission, serving others, loving them, sacrificing for them, warning them about God’s coming judgment, and pointing them to the forgiveness of sins and salvation that only I offer. Tell all your friends and family the bad news that they are sinners and the unimaginably good news that I died to rescue them from hell. Devote yourself to prayer, to worship, to friendship with other Christians, to membership in the local church. And do all of these things not grudgingly, but joyfully.”\nBe honest: how \nDoc 5(Title:  and family the bad news that they are sinners and the unimaginably good news that I died to rescue them from hell. Devote yourself to prayer, to worship, to friendship with other Christians, to membership in the local church. And do all of these things not grudgingly, but joyfully.”) Be honest: how would you feel about Jesus now? I’ll be honest. Part of me would feel claustrophobic. Even as a Christian, part of me wants to call the shots in my own life and wants to be my own ultimate authority. God’s demand for our complete allegiance makes us feel uncomfortable. Why? Because deep down inside, we want to be our own gods. If that’s the case, isn’t it clear that evidence is not the ultimate issue? Even if we had all the evidence we needed to convince us intellectually that God exists and that Christianity is true, there would still be a volitional, emotional barrier between us and God.\nDeep down inside, we want to be our own gods. If that’s the case, isn’t it clear that evidence is not the ultimate issue?\nThat is why, at least from a Christian perspective, the objection from divine hiddenness is weak. I agree that God could have provided even more evidence than he did, so much evidence that atheism or skepticism of any kind would cease to exist. But why think that a world of theists who loathed God would be significantly more desirable to God than our current world?\nGod’s purpose is to change hearts, not merely to change minds. Once we grant that a person can be completely intellectually convinced that God exists and still fail to love God, we have to reevaluate whether God would necessarily provide more evidence than he has. If none of us can honestly say that there is nothing in the Bible that disturbs us, nothing about God’s total claim over our lives that threatens us, and nothing about God’s moral commands that offends us, then why think that lack of evidence is our main problem or that God ought to provide more?\nNotes:\n- See, for example, John L.

They’ve become disappointed in the huge cost and the harm done by unmotivated and underpaid teachers. There have always been alternatives to the standard education path, such as home schooling, or, since the 1960’s, alternative schooling options such as Montessori schools. As a home-schooled kid myself, and now as an undergrad studying teaching, you could say that I have lot of my personality invested in this battle! In this article, I examine the pros and cons of these alternatives to mainstream schooling.) Home Schooling\nAny schooling is a school of hard knocks. And being thrown into the jungle is the best way to understand how things work. Being home schooled, and now as an adult, I have come to realize that you cannot expect someone or something to do your job for you. You have to do it yourself. If you have a problem, you have to find a solution. You have to be motivated to learn and to explore. And you have to be willing to take risks.\nI have always been interested in how things work, and during my home-schooling, I was encouraged to explore to find the answer for myself. And I found that I could take things apart and put them back together again. It wasn’t until the age of 15 that I met a mechanic, one of my dad’s friends. He showed me how to take apart and rebuild a motor one afternoon, while they sipped suds and talked. I went home and taught myself to do it again, on the lawnmower engine. When I was 17, I had the opportunity to do the same with a car’s transmission. I taught myself how to change the fluid etc. This was my first real experience with learning a technical skill. And it was the beginning of a lifelong quest. It’s not very feminine but hey, it’s awful handy when you’re in a remote little town!\nAfter that, I went to university to study teaching, and I have come to realize that education is a skill in itself. And it is not the kind of skill that you can learn in a classroom. It is something that you have to learn in the real world and through practice. And as a home schooled kid, I learned this skill very early. It is the reason why I am so passionate about teaching today.\nEveryone has this concerned notion about the myth that home-schooled kids turn out weird. Well, if you look at the statistics, it’s just not true. But you also have to look at it from another angle. If you have a kid who does not want to learn, no matter what kind of schooling you give them, it’s not going to work. And no one would want to home school a kid who is a real pain in the butt. At least mainstream schooling has a system in place to deal with and socialize the problem kids. And the home schooled kids do not have such issues. So it really depends on the kid. If you have a weird kid, maybe they’re not going to fit into mainstream schooling. On the other hand, being thrown into the big jungle of school is probably going to socialize them and they will very rapidly learn to not be such a weirdo. So it swings both ways. Most of all, you want to do what is right for your own kid, and make sure there’s a balance of learning at a rate that is fast enough for the individual person, while at the same time not just becoming an academic at age 10, and, you know, learning to talk to other humans too.\nAlternative Schooling\nI think that alternative schooling is a good option for people who don’t want to home school their kids. I think that alternative schools are also a great idea for children who cannot cope with mainstream schooling. The Montessori Schools are a good example of this. As a home-schooled kid, I occasionally went to a Montessori school through my primary school years, and it was a good alternative. The school had a lot of freedom for the kids. They were able to explore and learn at their own rate. I had already learnt to read, write and do simple math at an early age, on account of my home schooling, and if I had j\nDoc 3(Title: on.) Harm to Public Education. Home schooling limits public school enrollments and therefore reduces the amounts of money state governments provide to local school districts. It also reduces the numbers of parents who expect to enhance their own children’s education by voting for taxes and bond issues. On the other hand, home schooling reduces the burdens on public school systems and, in areas with growing populations, decreases pressure for new buildings and staffs. Unlike charters and public vouchers, home schooling does not force an overt transfer of public funds from an incumbent bureaucracy to a new rival organization.\nLike charters and vouchers, home schooling is also criticized for weakening the common civic enterprise represented by the public school system. To some, deliberation about education is a necessary means of making one society out of many groups. They think that people who demand freedom from regulations, educate children themselves, or pay for private schools weaken critical public forums. A contrary view is that intellectual and values diversity are so important to a democratic society that questions about education should never be settled authoritatively. People who hold that view point to legislatures’ susceptibility to capture by interest groups and their inability to settle deeply controversial issues. They have reason to think that state standard-setting processes have degenerated into logrolling sessions among advocates for different subjects and that states have pretended false clarity about what skills young people must have in our boisterous, competitive, fast-moving, technology-driven, and unpredictable society.\nAgain, in a situation where so little is understood, the potential harms of home schooling seem far smaller than the harms of trying to prevent or thwart it. Every issue raised here is amenable to evidence, but abstract arguments and fears do not stand up against home-school parents’ First Amendment rights and their evident willingness to back up conviction with money, time, and effort.\nConclusion\nThe issues raised above are far from resolved. Scholarly and political discussions about home schooling are burdened by an unrecognized ambiguity in our use of the term public education, which in some instances refers to a commitment to use any means necessary to ensure that every child learns enough to participate fully as a citizen, earner, and parent and in other instances refers to a specific set of political bargains, rules, programs, job rights, and bureaucratic oversight mechanisms. The difference between these two definitions of public education is evident everywhere but most painfully in the big cities. There, aspirations for student learning, racial justice, and introduction of disadvantaged students into the mainstream of society are high. Political and educational leaders talk endlessly about the importance of high standards. But students fall farther behind the longer they are in school, and more than half of them drop out before gaining a regular high school diploma.\nOur dialogue about home schooling, charters, and public vouchers, then, is frozen by confusion over means and ends. The people who run and staff conventional public schools are convinced that the current arrangements are public education. The question—put into play by home schooling and related reforms—is whether that definition is too narrow. It is time to ask whether home schooling, charters, and vouchers should be considered parts of a broad repertoire of methods that we as a society use to educate our children.\nA longer version of this essay will appear in a future issue of the Peabody Journal of Education.\nPaul T.

Someone asked me recently if I could wave a magic wand and do one thing to improve American education what would it be. Without hesitation, I replied: Eliminate state compulsory schooling statutes. Stripping the state of its power to define and control education under a legal threat of force is a necessary step in pursuit of education freedom and parental empowerment.\nSome argue that compulsory schooling laws are no big deal. After all, they say, private schooling and homeschooling are legal in all 50 states, so state control of education is limited. While it’s true that some parents may have access to government schooling alternatives, many states require private schools to receive authorization in order to operate. Despite ongoing efforts to expand education choice mechanisms, most parents have no choice but to send their child to an assigned district school.Homeschoolers in most states must comply with state or local reporting mandates that in some areas require homeschoolers to take standardized tests or meet state-determined curriculum requirements.\nThese hoops are for those lucky enough to jump out of compulsory mass schooling. Despite ongoing efforts to expand education choice mechanisms, like Education Savings Accounts (ESAs), vouchers, and tax-credit scholarship programs, most parents have no choice but to send their child to an assigned district school. Even if their child is being relentlessly bullied, even if they don’t feel that the academic environment is rigorous enough, even if they may personally disagree with some of the district’s ideological underpinnings—these parents are required by law to send their child to the appointed public school.\nAnd what if they don’t?\nTruancy and Neglectful Parenting\nTruancy laws, which originate from a state’s compulsory schooling statutes, grant the full power of the state to come after parents whose children may have spotty attendance records. An in-depth article in HuffPost recently revealed the damaging impact these laws can have on families and children, with parents being pulled out of their homes in handcuffs and sent to jail.\nFor Cheree Peoples, one of the parents spotlighted in the article whose daughter misses school frequently due to sickle cell anemia that frequently leaves her hospitalized and in pain, enforcement of these truancy laws has been extreme, adding to the stress of her already difficult life caring for a chronically ill child. Awakened in the early hours by police officers who arrested her for truancy, she told the HuffPost: “You would swear I had killed somebody.”\nThe HuffPost investigation revealed that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris was responsible for much of the heightened aggression toward parents regarding truancy. As California’s attorney general, Harris was a crusader against truancy and was instrumental in toughening criminal prosecution of parents whose children missed too much school. According to HuffPost:\nHarris’ innovation was that school authorities and the district attorney would work in concert, articulating the threat of prosecution much earlier in the process and keeping school officials involved long after a case was transferred to court.\nHarris held firm to her belief that neglectful parenting was the root cause of truancy, ignoring other potential explanations like lack of education choice for parents whose children may be suffering in their assigned district school. Harris’s actions to aggressively prosecute parents for truancy “were cementing the idea that parents always were the ultimate source of the problem.”\nThis is all so familiar. Harris, who billed herself as a “progressive prosecutor” for California, likely believed she was doing the right thing for children, saving them from their allegedly neglectful parents. Horace Mann, the “father of American public education” who is credited with helping to usher in the country’s first compulsory schooling s\nDoc 5(Title: articipants in a modern economy; and harm to public education, making it more difficult for other parents to educate their children.) - Student Learning. The very nature of home schooling makes it difficult to quantify student performance. But the best available evidence is strongly positive about home-school student learning. Consider these results from the Bob Jones University testing service for home schoolers:\n- Almost 25 percent of home-school students are enrolled one or more grades above their age level peers in public and private schools.\nHome-school student achievement test scores are exceptionally high. The median scores for every subtest at every grade (typically in the 70th to 80th percentile) are well above those of public and private school students.\nStudents who have been home schooled their entire academic life have higher scholastic achievement test scores than students who have attended other educational programs.\nHowever, these results are drawn from a small, self-selected group of home schoolers who sought a university’s help in assessing student progress. Although there is no known profile of home schoolers against which to compare the sample, it is almost certainly a better-educated, higher-income, and better-supported (e.g., by church membership) group than home schoolers as a whole.\nThus, it is still impossible to say whether, on the whole, home-schooling students are doing much better than their public and private school counterparts. However, it is also totally unwarranted to argue that home schoolers are doing badly. The available evidence certainly seems to indicate otherwise.\nPreparation for Adult Life. Nobody knows whether home schooling produces any different mixture of geniuses, socially adept individuals, academic failures, or misfits than do conventional public schools. For that matter, nobody has a good grasp on what the distribution of those outcomes is—or ought to be—in the population as a whole.\nSome educators worry about the agendas of conservative religious leaders and parents, assuming they want children to become intolerant, insular, hypercompetitive, or convinced of religious or racial superiority. There is little basis for these fears, other than the long-standing tensions between religious groups (both conservative and mainstream) and the academic left.\nOthers avoid the trap of assessing schools in terms of current pedagogical orthodoxies but worry that home schooling (along with private schooling, charters, and vouchers) pulls children away from the socially centripetal experience of the common school, in which people of all races and backgrounds are educated together to common standards. This concern too has little empirical basis. Home schoolers certainly do not experience “common schools,” but neither, apparently, does anyone else. Whether they attend private or public schools, the vast majority of students are likely to attend classes and associate with others very like themselves.\nMoreover, contemporary public schools do not meet the aspirations of those who expect them to be incubators of young democrats. Graduates of private (including conservative Christian) schools are more likely than demographically similar public school graduates to express tolerant attitudes, volunteer time and money for social causes, and participate in civic debates.\nNone of this proves that home schooling meets every aspiration Americans have for their children. But it does place the worries about home schooling in perspective, and it suggests the basis on which home schooling should be evaluated: It needs to be compared to the real performance of conventional public schools, not to some idealized aspiration.\nHarm to Public Education.

Public policies must be based on facts, not anecdotes or emotions. And the fact is that the vast majority of immigrants are not “criminals” in any meaningful sense of the word. The bulk of the immigration-enforcement apparatus in this country is not devoted to capturing the “worst of the worst” foreign-born criminals. Rather, as Secure Communities exemplifies all too well, the detention-and-deportation machine is designed primarily to track down and expel non-violent individuals, including legal residents of the United States who have worked and raised families here for many years. This brand of immigration policy is cruel, pointless, shortsighted, and counterproductive. And it is not an effective substitute for immigration reform which makes our immigration system responsive to the economic and social forces which drive migration in the first place.\nThe United States is in the midst of a “great expulsion” of immigrants, both lawfully present and unauthorized, who tend to be non-violent and non-threatening and who often have deep roots in this country. This relentless campaign of deportation is frequently justified as a war against “illegality”—which is to say, against unauthorized immigrants. But that justification does not come close to explaining the banishment from the United States of lawful permanent residents who committed traffic offenses and who have U.S.-based families. Nor does it explain the lack of due-process rights accorded to so many of the immigrants ensnared in deportation proceedings. Likewise, the wave of deportations we are currently witnessing is often portrayed as a crime-fighting tool. But, as the findings of this report make clear, the majority of deportations carried out in the United States each year do not actually target “criminals” in any meaningful sense of the word.\nPolicymakers who look at the entire foreign-born population of the United States through a law-enforcement lens are seeing things that aren’t really there. As renowned psychologist Abraham H. Maslow wrote many years ago, “it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.” The blunt weapon that is the U.S. immigration-enforcement apparatus is being wielded against a widening swath of the immigrant community, regardless of their ties to this country, regardless of whether or not they are actually criminals. It is long past time for U.S. immigration policies to accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of immigration to this country, based not on a reflexive politics of fear and myth, but on sound analysis and empirical evidence.\nDoc 2(Title: olicy has been applied by the federal government to immigrants who commit even the slightest offense or infraction. “Crimes” which might result in a fine or a suspended sentence for natives end up getting immigrants detained and deported. This represents a double standard of justice for immigrants in which the scale of the punishment (detention and deportation) far outweighs the severity of the crime (traffic offenses, for example). Unfortunately, this double standard has been the guiding principle behind a litany of immigration-enforcement laws and programs, such as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), the 287(g) program, Secure Communities, and the “Consequence Delivery System” implemented by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in 2011.) The evidence that immigrants tend not to be criminals is overwhelming. To begin with, there is an inverse relationship between crime and immigration. Crime rates in the United States have trended downward for many years at the same time that the number of immigrants has grown. Second, immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than the native-born. And, third, immigrants are less likely than the native-born to engage in the criminal behaviors that tend to land one in prison. No matter how you look at the issue, the inescapable conclusion is that immigrants are, on average, less prone to criminality than the U.S. native-born population.\nHigher Immigration is Associated with Lower Crime Rates\nAs the number of immigrants in the United States has risen in recent years, crime rates have fallen. Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population grew from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent {Figure 1} and the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled from 3.5 million to 11.2 million {Figure 2}. During the same period, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48 percent—which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder {Figure 3}. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41 percent, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary {Figure 4}. This decline in crime rates in the face of high levels of new immigration has been a steady national trend, and has occurred in cities across the country.\nThe most thoroughly studied aspect of this phenomenon has been the drop in rates of violent crime since the early 1990s in cities that have long been “gateways” for immigrants entering the United States, such as Miami, Chicago, El Paso, San Antonio, and San Diego. However, the inverse relationship between immigration and crime is also apparent in “new” immigrant gateways, such as Austin, where rates of both violent crime and serious property crime have declined despite high levels of new immigration. Declining rates of property crime have also been documented in metropolitan areas across the country. Some scholars suggest that new immigrants may revitalize dilapidated urban areas, ultimately reducing violent crime rates.\nIn short, to quote sociologist Robert J. Sampson, “cities of concentrated immigration are some of the safest places around.” The reason for this is straightforward. Immigrants as a group tend to be highly motivated, goal-driven individuals who have little to gain by running afoul of the law. As law professor and public-policy expert Michael Tonry puts it: “First-generation economic immigrants are self-selected risk takers who leave their homes, families, and languages to move to a new country to improve their and their children’s lives. They have good reasons to work hard, defer gratifications, and stay out of trouble.” Sampson and colleagues also find that immigrant communities are insulated from crime because they tend to display “social cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good.”\nThere is a sense of déjà vu in these modern-day findings. In the first three decades of the 20th century, during t\nDoc 3(Title: g is often portrayed as a crime-fighting tool. But, as the findings of this report make clear, the majority of deportations carried out in the United States each year do not actually target “criminals” in any meaningful sense of the word.) In November 2013, NPR reported that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had been instructed by Congress since 2009 to fill 34,000 beds in detention facilities across the country with immigrant detainees every day. It was immediately apparent that this sort of inmate quota would never fly if applied to native-born prisoners. As the NPR story puts it: “Imagine your city council telling the police department how many people it had to keep in jail each night.” Clearly, such a concept has nothing to do with fighting crime or protecting the public. But when it comes to the detention (and deportation) of immigrants, very different standards of justice and reason are at work.\nFor more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not “criminals” by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime.\nUnfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence, which is partly why immigrants are often treated like dangerous criminals by the U.S. immigration system. More precisely, immigrants have the stigma of “criminality” ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. From the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) to Operation Streamline (launched in 2005), immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of “felonies” have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. Moreover, as a growing body of “crimmigration” law has reimagined noncitizens as criminals and security risks, immigration law enforcement has increasingly adopted the securitized approach of criminal law enforcement. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized. As prominent immigration scholar Douglas Massey has written with regard to the plight of unauthorized immigrants in particular, “not since the days of slavery have so many residents of the United States lacked the most basic social, economic, and human rights.”\nThis report tackles the criminalization of immigration from two angles. First, it documents the fact that immigration is not associated with “crime” as it is commonly understood. For more than two decades, rates of violent crime and property crime have fallen in the United States as the immigrant population (including the unauthorized population) has grown. Moreover, immigrants are less likely than the native-born to be behind bars or to engage in typically “criminal behaviors.” Second, the report describes the ways in which U.S. immigration laws and policies are re-defining the notion of “criminal” as it applies to immigrants, while also ramping up the enforcement programs designed to find anyone who might be deportable. More and more, a zero-tolerance policy has been applied by the federal government to immigrants who commit even the slightest offense or infraction. “Crimes” which might result in a fine or a suspended sentence for natives end up getting immigrants detained and deported. This represents a double standard of justice for immigrants i\nDoc 4(Title: Who is an American? Traditionally, we look to citizenship to answer that question, but the issue is more complicated than legal labels. Even President Trump seems to recognize this in his periodic openness to negotiating comprehensive immigration reform.) Among the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States today, 60 percent have lived here for a decade or more. Many have built deep family and community ties, through U.S.-citizen spouses, children, jobs, homes and mortgages. They have become Americans in all but legal status.\nCurrent law rarely grants long-term immigrants the right to stay, sentencing them to a life of uncertainty without parole. Any unlucky traffic stop or encounter with law-enforcement officials can lead to deportation with no right of return. Such a punishment is in many ways worse than a prison sentence, which at least gives people who break the law a chance to return to their former life.\nThey don’t under criminal law. Except for the most heinous crimes, statutes of limitation require the government either to prosecute an offender within a certain period — five years for most federal crimes — or to drop the matter. Civil suits, such as for tort or breach of contract, must similarly be brought within a fixed period. We ordinarily do not countenance holding people accountable for misdeeds committed a decade or more ago, in part out of recognition that people should be able to move on with their lives despite what they have done in the past.\nIf we accept a time limit for holding even criminals accountable, why not for deporting immigrants? At some point, a person who entered the United States without authorization but has put down real roots in the country should be eligible for a path to legal status.\nWould ending this uncertainty after a specified period mean rewarding people for breaking the law? No, it would mean recognizing that enforcing the law is not the only interest at stake and that long-term residents also have legitimate interests in sustaining the lives they have built. That would not necessarily mean granting citizenship but would require at least a reasonable path to legal status.\nNot everyone would qualify. Congress would have to determine how long an immigrant must have lived in the United States to be eligible. Some people who have committed serious crimes could be presumptively excluded, although we should avoid the tendency of current law to treat petty crime as grounds for deportation.\nGranting legal status to long-term immigrants would also improve the lives of many U.S. citizens, especially the spouses and children of those who came to the United States illegally. We owe some respect to these families before deporting a mother or husband. Moreover, like any of us, immigrants witness crimes. They are likely to step forward to provide testimony only if they are safe from deportation. Entire sectors of the economy — such as agriculture, construction, landscape and domestic work — depend on immigrants who are willing to do jobs that ordinary Americans will not. And legal status would make people less vulnerable to economic exploitation, reducing downward pressure on wages.\nToday, the Trump administration’s deportation machine extends well beyond the nearly 700,000“dreamers” — the people brought to the United States as children but who now face a future of uncertainty. It also includes hundreds of thousands of people who have lived in the United States under protected status for well over a decade but who are now being ordered back to their home countries. These immigrants have built lives in America and now could see their futures crushed in a heartbeat.\nDoc 5(Title: geted Arabs, Muslims, and South Asians in the aftermath of 9/11, the “war on terror” has had an impact on all immigrants regardless of ethnicity or legal status—including Latin American immigrants, particularly Mexicans, who comprise the majority of immigration detainees. Post-9/11 policies not only increased funding for various immigration-enforcement functions as part of the broader effort to enhance national security, but fostered an “us or them” mentality in which “they” are the foreign-born.) More precisely, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 collectively “illustrate the accelerating criminalization of the immigration system.” This intersection of criminal and immigration law has led to a notable increase in deportations. As Stumpf notes, in the period “between 1908 and 1980, there were approximately 56,000 immigrants deported based on criminal convictions. In 2004 alone, there were more than 88,000 such deportations.” While immigration law had been used by U.S. authorities to remove non-citizens who came into contact with the criminal justice system in the pre-9/11 era, the relationship between these two systems of law intensified after 9/11. As law professor Teresa A. Miller notes, “After the attacks, zero-tolerance enforcement of immigration laws was extended to immigrants who had not passed through the criminal justice system, such as asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants.” The PATRIOT Act in particular allowed federal officers to apprehend and detain “non-citizens on immigration grounds without legal review and without public disclosure of the specific charge for a period of seven days, or for a maximum of six months if the case is deemed a national security risk.”\nThe “war on terror” thus had immediate implications for foreign-born individuals residing in the United States. As Miller states: “In January of 2002, Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson announced a new initiative to ‘locate, apprehend, interview, and deport’ approximately 314,000 noncitizens who had been ordered deported, but had failed to comply with their deportation orders.” This initiative led to the arrest of more than 1,100 Muslim and Arab men without formally charging them with a crime. However, the consequences of the PATRIOT Act extended beyond these individuals and into immigrant communities, ultimately being manifested through “racial profiling and scapegoating, mass detentions and mistreatment, and the government’s refusal to disclose information about those detained.”\nA prime example of the enforcement-only mindset of DHS and its component agencies in the post-9/11 era is “Operation Endgame”—the name given to the “Office of Detention and Removal Strategic Plan, 2003–2012,” which was released on June 27, 2003, by Anthony S. Tangeman, Director of ICE’s Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO). Tangeman succinctly explains the rationale underlying his department’s new strategic plan:\nAs the title implies, DRO provides the endgame to immigration enforcement and that is the removal of all removable aliens. This is also the essence of our mission statement and the ‘golden measure’ of our success. We must endeavor to maintain the integrity of the immigration process and protect our homeland by ensuring that every alien who is ordered removed, and can be, departs the United States as quickly as possible and as effectively as practicable. We must strive for 100% removal rate.\nHowever, Tangeman’s assertions about how best to “protect our homeland” ring hollow given that the vast majority of immigrants aren’t criminals (let alone terrorists), and that even minor infractions can render an immigrant “deportable” under current law.

The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and international human rights law. Many countries have constitutional laws that protect freedom of speech. Terms such as free speech, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression are often used interchangeably in political discourse. However, in legal contexts, freedom of expression more broadly encompasses the right to seek, receive, and impart information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.\nArticle 19 of the UDHR states that \"everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference\" and \"everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice\". The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries \"special duties and responsibilities\" and may \"therefore be subject to certain restrictions\" when necessary \"[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others\" or \"[f]or the protection of national security or public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals\".[1]\nTherefore, freedom of speech and expression may not be recognized as absolute. Common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, hate speech, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, blasphemy and perjury. Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\".[2]\nThe \"offense principle\" is also used to justify speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.[2]\nWith the evolution of the digital age, new means of communication emerged. However, these means are also subject to new restrictions. Countries or organizations may use internet censorship to block undesirable or illegal material. Social media platforms frequently use content moderation to filter or remove user-generated content that is deemed against the terms of service, even if that content is not illegal.\nHistorical origins\n[edit]Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern international human rights instruments.[3] It is thought that the ancient Athenian democratic principle of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.[4]\nFreedom of speech was vindicated by Erasmus and Milton.[3] Edward Coke claimed freedom of speech as \"an ancient custom of Parliament\" in the 1590s, affirmed in the Protestation of 1621.[5] Restating what is written in the English Declaration of Right, 1689, England's Bill of Rights 1689 legally established the constitutional right of freedom of speech in Parliament, which is still in effect.[6][7] This so-called parliamentary privilege includes no possible defamation claims, meaning Parliamentarians are free to speak up in the House without fear of legal action.[8] This protection extends to written proceedings: for example, written and oral questions, motions and amendments tabled to bills and motions.[8] Taking refuge in England in 1726, Voltaire wrote about his admiration for the tolerance and freedom of speech in Englan\nDoc 2(Title: ieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is. The strength of the Internet is chaos.\" Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so that strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment protects.[106]) The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the \"Information Society\" in stating:\nWe reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers.[107]\nAccording to Bernt Hugenholtz and Lucie Guibault, the public domain is under pressure from the \"commodification of information\" as information with previously little or no economic value has acquired independent economic value in the information age. This includes factual data, personal data, genetic information and pure ideas. The commodification of information is taking place through intellectual property law, contract law, as well as broadcasting and telecommunications law.[108]\nFreedom of information has emerged in response to state-sponsored censorship, monitoring, and internet surveillance. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the Internet.[109] The Global Internet Freedom Consortium claims to remove blocks to the \"free flow of information\" for what they term \"closed societies\".[110] According to the Reporters without Borders (RWB) \"internet enemy list\" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: Mainland China, Cuba, Iran, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.[111]\nA widely publicized example of internet censorship is the \"Great Firewall of China\" (in reference both to its role as a network firewall and the ancient Great Wall of China). The system blocks content by preventing IP addresses from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and proxy servers at the internet gateways. The system also selectively engages in DNS poisoning when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.[112] Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations, including more than sixty regulations directed at the Internet. Censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned ISPs, business companies, and organizations.[113][114]\nSaudi Arabia's government had been intensifying the scrutiny of social media accounts, under which they were detaining several activists, critics, and even normal social media users over a few critical tweets. A law professor, Awad Al-Qarni, became a victim of Saudi Arabia's internet censorship and was facing a death sentence. Saudi-controlled media portrayed him as a dangerous preacher due to his Twitter and WhatsApp posts, but dissidents considered him an important intellectual who maintained strong social media influence.[115]\nSee also\n[edit]- Academic freedom\n- Artistic freedom\n- Bans on communist symbols\n- Bans on Nazi symbols\n- Cancel culture\n- Censorship of LGBTQ issues\n- Civic engagement\n- Civil and political rights\n- Digital rights\n- Election silence\n- Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\n- Forced or comp\nDoc 3(Title: Freedom Versus Security: Can We Find the Right Balance?) \nen away, sometimes quite literally. And the second cluster was around negative behavioral responses ranging from things like noncompliance to more extreme manifestations of reactants in the form of, for example, public protest.\n\n##### Charles Blue (03:08)\n\nYour paper implies that there may be an important middle ground and specific tactics that policymakers could use to protect health. This is sort of balancing out the freedom versus protecting public good. Could you spell those out for us.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (03:24)\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. So we suggest that if you, as a policymaker, take the psychology of freedom seriously, then you realize it’s important to balance new restrictions with some other methods of either maintaining a sense of freedom or the very least helping people see the value of increased restrictions. So we try to summarize a lot of behavioral science research around this topic in a set of four easy principles that we call safe principles and that’s an acronym for spelling out the benefits of restricting freedom, attaching a moral value to behaviors both desired and undesired, reframing restrictions as freedom from and encouraging freedom in other ways. So I can sort of briefly walk you through each of those one by one.\n\n##### Charles Blue (04:05)\n\nYeah, let’s go ahead and dive down that path because those all seem to make kind of sense, but I’m not sure how they would be implemented.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (04:13)\n\nYeah. So the first spelling out the benefits of freedom can be implemented in different ways. It’s really all about making the reasons why restrictive freedom is a good thing more salient. So you can do this by invoking compelling and memorable narratives, maybe focusing on one particular person and having that be a salient example in people’s minds. You can do it by spelling out the many different groups of people who would be benefited by adhering to new restrictions from loved ones, family and friends to children to older adults to compromised individuals and other people who might just be more vulnerable. You can also do it sometimes by effectively invoking threats. So really emphasizing the danger that’s posed by the pandemic or by other sources of threat. And what I would say there is that it’s important when using those kinds of fear appeals to just make sure that people have a sense of self efficacy, that they can do something about it, because if you just make people scared, then they become resigned and they feel panicked and trapped. But if you make them feel like there’s a clear thing they can do, like effectively social distancing or staying at home, then threat might be more effective as well. The second principle is about attaching a moral value, and that’s about framing restrictions in terms of right and wrong. And so we know from a lot of work on moral cognition that moral framings are potentially really powerful drivers of behavior. And you’ve seen examples of this throughout history. So things like littering and drunk driving, there’s a lot of activism around making those about right and wrong rather than, say personal freedom. And that’s why I think many of us were more accepting of public policies restricting those behaviors. And I think you can see the power of moral framing in everyday actions, like why do we return a shopping cart to sort of the shopping cart Loading spot after grocery shopping.\n\n##### Charles Blue (06:05)\n\nOr we wish people did.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (06:06)\n\nYeah. Or we wish people did. And that’s because we see it as a moral action. So when I do that, it’s not because I think I’m going to be punished. No one is going to do anything to me if I just leave it by where my car was parked. But I take the extra steps of bringing it back just because I know it’s like the right thing to do. So moral framework, at least for those of us who return our shopping cards, can be potentially powerful. The third principle \nDoc 4(Title: By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:) Section 1. Policy. Free speech is the bedrock of American democracy. Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The freedom to express and debate ideas is the foundation for all of our rights as a free people.\nIn a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators.\nThe growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology. Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms. As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square.\nTwitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see.\nAs President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes. It is essential to sustaining our democracy.\nOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other troubling behaviors, online platforms “flagging” content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any stated terms of service; making unannounced and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disfavoring certain viewpoints; and deleting content and entire accounts with no warning, no rationale, and no recourse.\nTwitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician’s tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called ‘Site Integrity’ has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.\nAt the same time online platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise restrict Americans’ speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China. One United States company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted searches for “human rights,” hid data unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party, and tracked users determined appropriate for surveillance.

But I take the extra steps of bringing it back just because I know it’s like the right thing to do. So moral framework, at least for those of us who return our shopping cards, can be potentially powerful. The third principle is about reframing restrictions as freedom from so many of these public policies aimed at increasing security can be thought of as ways of increasing a different kind of freedom. They might be limiting your freedom to do whatever you want, but they might be increasing your freedom from threats. So, for example, you see this in the history of smoking bans in the United States. For a long time, smoking was thought of as an individual Liberty, and so attempts to ban smoking would be seen as a real restriction on what you’re free to do. But then the conversation shifted and became more about secondhand smoke and the danger of smoking posed to other people.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (07:09)\n\nAnd once it became a conversation about protecting others individual freedom from the threat of secondhand smoking or other kinds of security threats, then suddenly it became more defensible and more accepted to have these kinds of smoking bans. And so that kind of reframing can be really effective. And I think sometimes it’s so clear to us that we take it for granted. So you don’t see public protests around bans on Hasbro for using lead paint and children’s toys. And that’s because it’s so clear to us that we want children to be free from that kind of threat. So it’s just about understanding new policies through that same kind of light that we often accept. And then the final principle, encouraging freedom other ways Is about finding new outlets for people to exercise freedom. So as you’re losing some perceived freedoms to gain security, Maybe there are other ways either at the individual level or the more structural, collective level that you can see ways to increase your freedom as well. So I think when many of us adopted new habits like becoming obsessed with baking sourdough, that was a way of exercising agency, Taking on something new.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (08:12)\n\nIt was probably about passing the time, But I think also just exercising this freedom of choice. And then I think there’s a lot of room for policy makers to facilitate that kind of thing. A couple of examples would just be putting more funding towards resources like online libraries and Museum tours in ways that allow us to virtually explore the world as well as amenities like public parks and hiking trails Where we can get out of the world, exercise our freedom Even as we’re also under many restrictions.\n\n##### Charles Blue (08:39)\n\nI want to go back to something you said earlier. And it struck me that you said that the loss of freedom hurts almost as if it’s a physical injury or damage that a person suffers when they were real or not feel they have given up a type of freedom. Could you explain that a little bit more? What do you mean when someone is physically hurt by giving up a freedom?\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (09:01)\n\nYeah, so partly I’m invoking metaphor here, but in a sense, we do see a lot of research that connects people’s sense of autonomy to their physical wellbeing. And a lot of that work is under the umbrella of self determination theory which argues that a sense of autonomy, a free choice of freedom is one of the fundamental needs that all people have and that can look different across different cultural contexts. But all of us need to feel some kind of sense of agency or freedom to pursue what we want to do. And so when we have that freedom taken away, It causes mental pain and sometimes physical pain as we suffer the physical and mental health consequences of having that kind of restriction.\n\n##### Charles Blue (09:42)\n\nThis may not come under the umbrella of your research, but has there been anyone who’s looked into just \n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is evident that freedom of speech is a cornerstone of a functional society.

One way Jesus could have handled those urges is by participating in homosexual acts which were not too uncommon for men in the time and place that he lived. However, homosexuality in monotheistic faith has always been a point of contention, so this possibility is often overlooked. Until now.) What makes the case for a queer Jesus so interesting is the sexual climate he lived in. Ancient Greece is somewhat known for including homosexual acts, especially between men, as part of their culture. It wasn’t exactly the kind of all-encompassing queer culture we have today with marriage equality and whatnot. Instead, think Grindr personified. What made Ancient Greece so different was that there was no concept of sexuality at that time, but only of an active role (tops) and a passive role (bottoms). Not having a concept of sexuality excluded the possibility of romantic same-sex relationships but encouraged frequent, meaningless homosexual encounters (hookups). It was the custom that as long as men assumed the active role, they could preserve their masculinity and have sex with whoever they pleased. However, if a grown man assumed the passive role it was cause for great shame and embarrassment. This general attitude created a dynamic in Ancient Greece where wealthy men often had extramarital relations with male slaves, prostitutes (who were often free slaves), and most notably, boys ages 12 to 17. Not exactly the masc for masc fantasy that’s so common today, but you get the point.\nOf course, anyone who knows anything about the life of Jesus knows that he wasn’t in Ancient Greece but in Ancient Rome. Ancient Greece is important, however, because it provided a template for how the Romans treated sexuality. In other words, the Grindr of Greek culture got an app store update and rebranded itself as Rome. This made two men having intercourse in Rome so common that when the act occasionally found its way into theater it required no explanation nor would it even be the source of controversy. I can see it now, Romos: The Musical. Jokes aside, one thing that culturally distinguished Rome was that Rome focused more on the dichotomy between citizens and noncitizens. So, while a typical homosexual encounter in Greece would involve something like a master and apprentice, Roman homosexuality almost exclusively involved a slave, non-citizen, or member of a marginalized group like the Jews. Yes, this means that if anything, Jesus was probably a bottom.\nIn addition to his status as a Jew in a Roman society, Jesus’ reputation would have given him an even greater likelihood of being accused of participating in homosexual acts. Around Jesus’ lifetime, there was a shift in the dominant culture of Rome to ostracize men that threatened the status quo. The types of men affected were typically kind and effeminate, and religiously or politically deviant. Once targeted, these men would be pointed out as those who prefer the passive role and the stigma attached to that label made their lives hell. Essentially, a form of ancient homophobia in which troublesome men would be rumored as bottoms and the world would consequently shun them. While there’s no evidence that indicates Jesus was particularly effeminate, he was surely kind, and both politically and religiously deviant enough to get crucified. Since he fit the profile so well, there is actually a strong likelihood that leading up to his death, Jesus garnered a dangerous reputation in Rome for being the type of man that would submit to playing the passive role. Furthermore, this reputation would have given his followers a strong reason to deny his sexuality in order to preserve his image– regardless of the truth of the matter. A solemn reminder that sometimes there’s no safer place than the closet.\nAt this point, it seems fair to ask ju\nDoc 2(Title: What’s So Queer About the Ascension?) Today’s reflection is by Bondings 2.0 contributor Allison Connelly, whose bio is available here.\nToday’s liturgical readings for the Solemnity of the Ascension can be found here. Note that for some dioceses where the solemnity was marked last Thursday, today’s readings at Mass may be different.\nThere’s something incredibly queer about the Ascension. This ancient feast, observed as early as the fifth century C.E. and celebrated in some places last Thursday, is marked this Sunday, too. What stories do today’s readings tell—and why are these so queer? Let me explain.\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus promises to be with the disciples always, to the end of the age. In Acts, Jesus tells his disciples that they will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them, and he is then lifted up and hidden from their view by a cloud. Two strangers dressed in white pop in to tell the disciples, “Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way.“ Importantly, in our second reading – which gives no particular account of the act of Ascension, but an image of its heavenly result – describes Jesus seated at the right hand of God, as head over the church, “which is his body.”\nSo to clarify: Jesus will be with the disciples always, but not bodily, and Jesus is also bodily in heaven, and will return bodily from heaven. Right? Ok. But wait: his body is on earth, because his body is the church. And when Jesus leaves, the Holy Spirit appears, swapping one Person of God for another. But then again, Jesus doesn’t leave, because he says that he will be with the disciples always. How do we make sense of so many seeming contradictions?\nAs I said, the Ascension readings seem very queer to me. First, the body of readings is about transition and transformation: from earth to heaven, from Christ to Spirit, from human body to church-y body. Who understands this trans-ition and trans-formation more than queer and trans people? We constantly transition and transform: our wardrobes, our make-up, our pronouns, our names, our identities, our gender presentation, our politics, even our fundamental self-understanding. Jesus instructs his disciples – and, by extension, all of us – to bear witness to him, to the Divine, and this is our witness as LGBTQ+ people: that transition and transformation can, at their best, bring us closer to what is true, what is authentic, and what is human.\nThese readings are queer to me in another way, too, in the sense of “queer” as a verb. When used as a verb, “to queer” means to intentionally subvert or challenge our normative and binary assumptions and systems of operation (including but not limited to our defaults of hetero- or cis-normativity), often through absurdity or exaggeration, opening new possibilities that blur our boundaries and allow space for fluidity.\nIf the Ascension isn’t “absurdity” and “exaggeration” I don’t know what it is! Jesus is talking to his disciples, then suddenly raised up physically above them, then hidden behind a cloud, and then two strangers show up out of nowhere and start lecturing his friends? I’ve seen drag shows with less drama.\nIn the Ascension, and in the stories we encounter today, everything is “yes/and,” challenging our normative, human fixation on “either/or.” Jesus has left us and is with us always. Jesus’ body is in heaven and his body is the church on earth. Jesus will return physically from heaven and is present now, mysteriously, through the Spirit.\nQueering is also “subversive” and “opens new possibilities,” which I find abundantly clear in the Ascension. When Jesus ascends bodily into heaven, he subverts all of our binary expectations about the separation of what is “human” from what is “Divine.” With his physical body in heaven and his earthly body as the Church, he opens new possibilities for our human bodies to participate in the life of Christ through ritual and community. We are promised that Jesus will return the sam\nDoc 3(Title: ations about the separation of what is “human” from what is “Divine.” With his physical body in heaven and his earthly body as the Church, he opens new possibilities for our human bodies to participate in the life of Christ through ritual and community. We are promised that Jesus will return the same way he left: in community, subverting our societal obsession with individualism and personal accomplishment. While Jesus takes his physical leave from his friends, he promises to be with them always through the Spirit of God, opening new possibilities for fluidity in relationship.) In the Ascension, Jesus queers what it means to be present with, for, and among each other. He queers our understanding of bodies, physicality, and permanence. He queers the distinctions we try to make between the many forms and faces of God in our world. He queers the boundaries that we have constructed between heaven and earth.\nIn doing all this, Jesus invites us into the queer rhythms of Divine accompaniment, the queer mystery of Divine embodiment, and the queer practice of life in the Trinity. May we accept this invitation to follow the queer way of Jesus. May we always bear witness to his life and love as our full trans-itioning and trans-forming selves. And may we feel the presence of God within us and around us, in our humanity and our spark of divinity, until the end of the age.\n—Allison Connelly-Vetter (she/her), May 21, 2023\nDoc 4(Title: g the passive role. Furthermore, this reputation would have given his followers a strong reason to deny his sexuality in order to preserve his image– regardless of the truth of the matter. A solemn reminder that sometimes there’s no safer place than the closet.) At this point, it seems fair to ask just how likely it was that Jesus would take a partner of any gender. Biblically and historically there isn’t any evidence pointing strongly either way, and the prevailing two theories among Christians are a somewhat unfounded claim for his celibacy and an argument for his relationship with Mary Magdalene. However, I could just as easily write a gay fanfic about Jesus and John the Apostle that has the same level of merit, so reading into those claims would be ill-advised. All we really know is that it was extremely common for first-century rabbis to have multiple partners throughout their lives and eventually marry, and that Jesus surely faced social pressure to fit this norm. Even if he were to succumb to that pressure though, who’s to say whether that relationship would have been Jim and Pam from The Office or just a second beard for when the one on his face wasn’t enough.\nUnfortunately, despite living in a society that was more accepting than many other ancient cultures, the odds are in favor of Jesus having never performed a homosexual act. There exists neither historical nor biblical evidence to suggest that Jesus was interested in anything sexual, homo or otherwise. Analyzing Roman culture just tells us more about the world Jesus lived in rather than participated in since even the historical Jesus surely lived a unique life. The same goes for analyzing the typical first-century Jewish man. That being said, the fact that there is little conclusive evidence he ever took a partner only strengthens the likelihood that if he did actually have sex that it was with a man. Anything he did with a woman would have been seen as much more substantial, and consequently recorded. However, it’s entirely possible that he could have had casual sex with a man and nobody even thought it important enough to mention, or better yet, they thought it important enough to hide.\nThere are a few further implications from this that I think are really important to note. First and foremost, I can say with certainty that Jesus knew about and interacted with queerness many times in the course of his life. Given his reputation, it seems the only plausible reaction Jesus would have had to interacting with queers was to be kind, accepting, and offer forgiveness. In fact, it’s likely that Jesus himself was labeled as a queer, and that label became an important part of his life and experience on earth. In today’s world where queerness and faith often find themselves at odds, it’s important to remind ourselves that moral figures like Jesus exist not to make us question ourselves or others, but to set an example of the type of unconditional kindness we should lead our lives with.\nDoc 5(Title: ne. But it is also iconic of the queerness of God. The Trinity affirms a God who is [checks notes] both essentially three and essentially one. I cannot begin to imagine anything stranger or queerer than that. It’s an outrage to simple, populist thinking. The doctrine sits there in the architecture of Christian imaginations, and we barely begin to appreciate the Escher-like queerness of it all.) Althaus-Reid talks about how so many traditional ways of talking about God “closet the divine.” The church wants to force God’s abundant and life-transforming outrageousness into hiding. As a Latinx Catholic growing up in Argentina, Althaus-Reid witnessed the garish campiness of festivals in which statues of the Blessed Virgin, the Queen of Heaven, were processed through streets. Yet for all her sense that this was something that held the possibility of queering our imaginations, she came to see that the authorized church version of the Mother of God was sanitized: Mary was presented as a rich white woman who never walked. The divine image was made bland, and the unruly facts of actual cis and trans women’s lives were erased.\nOne need not be a radical to hold out for a more richly nuanced and liberating version of God. A queer lens—offering a skewed and disruptive attention to what is already there and what has been excluded—reappraises our traditions and invites us to locate our weirdness and particularity in a God who receives our actual bodies with joy. Jesus has so often been sanitized. This does no honor to the biblical story of a God whose living body is pierced and penetrated and whose risen body bears the marks of trauma into heaven. Whether we identify as queer or not, a picture of God or humanity that edits out all that seems strange is not a vision of a life-giving world.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, there is no clear evidence suggesting that Jesus was queer.

Tonight’s events, although not terribly embarrassing in some ways, were certainly uncomfortable and funny enough to make a good enough ice breaker story!) At some point around 5 o’clock our neighborhood generator power went out. Fully expecting it to return once they put more benzene in, I did nothing. The rest of my housemates were napping so they didn’t notice. At that point we had 2 washing machines, 3 computers, and one inverter turned on. This was a lot, but should have been okay. I don’t think there was anything else besides lights and the refrigerator. But maybe there was. After a dinner of cooked frozen pizzas (merely because they boasted pepperoni! The first time in months!) we were musing about why we had no power yet. (It was 7:00.) So, one of my roommates and I wandered down our street to our breaker box carrying half of a broom handle. The weather is cooler in the evening and so all of our neighbors were out standing around. I don’t know what they were doing before we showed up, but after we stepped out on the street all eyes were on us.\nSmile, wave, choni bashi… Oh, hello, how are you, I know a little Kurdish, kem Kurdi azanm. Before we made it down to the box I asked one lady if they had power, they did. Do we have a problem? Yes… That meant that yes it was our breaker that must have flipped. She says something else, I smile, te-negm…I don’t understand. Afoo…sorry. I want to be able to communicate with my neighbors! “Allo!” from a child sitting against a tan concrete wall. Some children on an upper balcony wave to us as they hang a beautiful deep red carpet off the wall. Others wave and smile. They know why we walk down the street. The broom handle is a dead giveaway.\nReaching the breaker box I reach the pole up and turn the switch on. We wait a moment or two to see if it just flips back off. Nope… ahh… walk back by all our gaping neighbors and into our house. The relief of being out of sight behind our very own wall. Entering into the house we smile at our housemates.\nIf that were the end of the story, it would be pretty much like any other evening. But instead, moments after entering the house and smiling at our housemates, the power flipped off AGAIN! This time the microwave was going too. So what do we have to do? Yes. Tammy and I grinned, chuckled, turned off half the lights and both washers and took another stroll.\nThis time they weren’t just staring… they were laughing. It was okay, I guess, because we were laughing too. Our next door neighbor lady asked us something about the problem and I just shrugged my shoulders… a great universal signal. We flipped the breaker switch again… a man explained that maybe we should call the office if we had problems. After flipping the switch a little wrinkled woman all in black with small black sparkles on her head scarf asked us if we would come sit by her. I wanted to, but there was work to be done, and we couldn’t really carry on a conversation anyway. So sorry… natwanim… I can’t. I should have.\nBack past the neighbors… Due to previous success with me in the language department, our next door neighbor lady started rattling off at me at high speed. I looked like a deer in the headlights. So sorry… good bye… xwahafis!\nAs I have been typing, the power went off again. Someone turned it back on… maybe one of our neighbors took pity on us to save us from the shame of having to traipse back down the street.\nI blush. But at the same time I like my neighbors, I like where I live, and I love the good medicine that laughter is.

This is just plain stupidly funny, so when I tell my mom what she does and told her that I’m not taking her gifts because she tried to kick me about of the house naked, she told me she was mad and she never meant to do that and she says thing that are hurtful and that she didn’t mean it. How many of you have parents who says this and then continue to repeat their crap? to get to the bottom of this, I just want both my adopted parents to die already. I just want them dead before thanksgiving of 2021, either today or tomorrow would be great! I don’t care how they die, I just hope and want and wish for them to be dead! I dontcare that this is mean or cruel, but honestly, if you were in my shoes, You would know exactly how the hell I am feeling and how much pain and how hurt I am. I don’t care about my adopted parents anymore, I tried to see the good in them, but all I see is selfish ungreatful, untrustworthy, 2 faced narrissist, abusive, toxic parents. I wish they were dead.) KF\nNovember 21st, 2021 at 11:22 AMI have lived with a toxic dysfunctional family my whole life. Abusive parents and siblings who then gaslight you about their abuse.other relatives who do the same because all they hear is one side and all they see is the wonderful public side of my parents etc. and I don’t bad mouth or air dirty laundry plus it’s embarrassing to admit I have such a messed up family. Publicly we are well known and respected in the community but here I am at 50 years old still dealing with my 81 yo abusive father who has always criticized me and for years has verbally assaulted me and keeps getting worse. He has no restraint and calls me horrible vile names. He treats my mom same way. As a kid he would tell me he didn’t want to be married or he once told me he was leaving as my 5 yo self hysterically cried and begged him not to go. All I know is chaos. That’s why I never had kids. As much as I wanted to in order to create my own healthy family I also was too afraid to repeat the cycle and I have repeated the cycle towards my own husband. My father is selfish and gives zero fks about the damage he has done to my spirit. He doesn’t even care anymore if we are in public he will verbally attack me, call me horrible names and flip me off. He’s pathetic. Even his own grandkids he never played with when they would visit. Just watches TV like he did when I was a kid but constantly complains that he has no time for himself and we all take up all his time etc. I have always been the helpful one and he has never appreciated it, but I have two siblings who are suddenly monopolizing al his time because I know they are hoping he will ,Dave them money when he dies. I can’t even afford a house and want nothing from him. He has never helped me with anything. He puts strangers before his own family and whenever er I have needed help he uses it as an opportunity to criticize me and blame me for my problems. As a little girl he was my hero and now I hate him and resent him and have no respect for him. He has publicLy humiliated me and verbally a\nDoc 5(Title: my wife says my relationship with my coworker is inappropriate) \nown admission you knew how that coffee remark would come across. And you’re responding “wow” to photos of her. That’s inappropriate, full stop. (Truly, “wow”? Would you ever respond to photos of a male coworker that way, assuming you weren’t trying to hit on him?) It’s flirtatious banter at a minimum, and most women would take it as signaling an openness to more. Your wife clearly took it that way, and it’s _highly_ likely that your coworker has too.\n\nI don’t think you can be truly oblivious to the way all of this reads. Just the level of detail that you’ve included here says the relationship, and this person, are taking up an enormous amount of space in your brain — you’re remarking on how many vowels she’s using in her greetings!\n\nYou’ve painted the situation as “work relationships are just like this now,” but they’re not. Do you have _any_ other work relationships like this? I’m guessing the answer is no; it’s just her. And what you’re describing, with this level of intimacy, is an emotional affair.\n\nTo be clear, it’s not that men and women can’t be friends. Of course they can! But that’s not what this is. The sexual innuendo and admiring comments about her physical attractiveness have made it something else.  As an experiment, I tried reading your letter without those details and that _would_ change things — without those details this could indeed be just a close work friendship. Even then, I’d suggest you look at the amount of emotional energy you were investing in the relationship just to make sure (and perhaps have a look at [stuff](https://relationship-institute.com/emotional-affairs/) on [emotional affairs](https://www.verywellmind.com/emotional-affairs-and-infidelity-2303091) as a reality check). But once those pieces are there, they really do color the entire relationship in a way that makes it impossible to read it differently.\n\nIn fact, here’s a good test: would you have shown your wife all those messages on your own and felt there was nothing there she might object to? Or did you know she would be uncomfortable if she saw them?\n\nI’m not saying that “my spouse would be uncomfortable with this” is always a good measure of whether something is wrong; there are overly controlling spouses out there. But the vast majority of spouses would be uncomfortable with what you’ve described; it doesn’t take an excessively controlling spouse to be bothered by what’s happened here.\n\nYou’re flirting _and_ emotionally invested to an inappropriate degree. Your wife is not off-base.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the documents provided, it appears that embarrassing moments with foreigners often involve cultural misunderstandings, social faux pas, or awkward situations.

However, during later confirmation hearings, he claimed that he \"did not have communications with the Russians\" when prompted by Senator Al Franken. Once reports of his meetings with Kislyak surfaced, Sessions recused himself from any investigation into Russia's interference in our 2016 presidential election. Many officials are continuing to call for his resignation.\n- Rex Tillerson: Tillerson, President Trump's former Secretary of State, worked on energy projects in Russia for two decades during his career at Exxon. He has publicly described his \"very close relationship\" with President Putin and was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013, the highest state honor possible for a foreigner.\n- Jared Kushner: Kushner is President Trump's son-in-law and current Senior Advisor. Along with Michael Flynn, Kushner met with Ambassador Kislyak during the Presidential transition. The White House later acknowledged that following that meeting, Ambassador Kislyak requested a second meeting, which Kushner had a deputy attend. However, at Kislyak's request, Kushner did later meet with Sergey Gorkov, the head of Russia's state-owned development bank, who has close ties to President Putin. The U.S. placed this bank on its sanctions list following Russia's annexation of Crimea. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to question Kushner about his meetings with Russian officials. The New York Times recently reported that Kusher failed to disclose dozens of contacts with foreign leaders on his application for top-secret security clearance -- one of those contacts being Ambassador Kislyak.\n- Donald Trump, Jr.: Trump, Jr., President Trump's son, met with Fabien Baussart, a leader of a Syrian opposition group backed by the Russian government, and others about how the U.S. could work with Russia on the Syrian conflict weeks before Donald Trump was elected President. He has also been quoted saying that his father's businesses \"see a lot of money pouring in from Russia\", and that he had visited Russia on business over a half-dozen times. In June 2016, he met with a Russian billionaire, Emin Agalarov, under the premise that Emin had \"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia\" from the Crown prosecutor of Russia, and that this was part of \"Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n- Paul Manafort: Manafort, who has business connections to Russia and Ukraine, was hired as Trump's campaign manager in March 2016. He then resigned in August of the same year, after reports surfaced that suggested he had received $12.7 million from Victor Yanukovych, Ukraine's pro-Russia former president. It was recently revealed by AP that Manafort proposed in a strategy plan from as early as June 2005 that he would work to influence politics, business deals, and media inside the U.S. and Europe to benefit Putin. This plan was pitched to Oleg Deripaska, a \"Russian aluminum magnate\" with close ties to Putin. Manafort eventually signed a $10 million contract with Deripaska in early 2006. The Trump Administration and Manafort have both said that Manafort never worked for Russian interests. Since the FBI confirmed in a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 20 that investigators are examining whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, the White House has made attempts to distance itself from Manafort, claiming that he played \"a very limited role\" in the campaign, despite his clear leadership role as campaign chairman leading up to the Republican National Convention. On October 27, 2017, Manafort was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy against the United States, among other charges.\n- Ca\nDoc 3(Title: untable policing and criminal justice practices to enhance public trust and public safety; protect the census and affirm that apportionment counts include all people; and much more.) January 20: President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, including directing the Department of Defense to allocate personnel to support the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border. It also revoked President Biden’s order that blocked funds from being diverted to border wall construction.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship in direct contradiction to the plain text of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, though the order doesn’t specify how agencies would carry it out. The Department of Justice defended this order in multiple courts.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order that seeks to revise his plan to strip employment protections for federal workers, including by reinstating Schedule F. Tens of thousands of federal civilian workers could lose protection from being arbitrarily fired and potentially replaced with Trump administration loyalists under the schedule F plan, though the order changes “F” to the words “Policy/Career.”\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order to restore the federal death penalty, instructing the attorney general to “pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use” and directs the attorney general to “take all necessary and lawful action” to ensure that states with capital punishment have sufficient access to the drugs needed for lethal injection executions.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order that calls for increased border wall construction, deployment of Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense personnel to the border, and detention. It also reinstates the “Remain in Mexico” program.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order that suspends admissions of refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, subject to a review every 90 days, and revokes a Biden-era executive order on refugee resettlement.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order that defines ‘sex’ in unscientific narrow binary terms, mandates that federal policies and documents align with this definition, and prohibits funding or promotion of so-called “gender ideology.” It also directs agencies to remove references to nonbinary people and prohibit recognition of gender identity differently from sex assigned at birth in a blatant attack on trans people. Many of the actions listed in this order would be in direct conflict with much of the Supreme Court’s opinion in Bostock v. Clayton County, binding precedent interpreting Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex in the workplace. The order also calls on the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Homeland Security to ignore the guidelines of the Prison Rape Elimination Act and enforce a blanket policy forcing transgender women into men’s prisons and detention centers against their will.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order calling for an end to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs, policies, and activities in the federal government. Specifically, it provides a list of federal grantees who received federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or environmental justice programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued a proclamation that commutes the sentences of several people convicted of violent crimes related to the January 6 insurrection and grants “a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.”\n- Read The Leadership Conference’s response here.\nJanuary 20: President Trump issued an executive order setting up a 60-day wind\nDoc 4(Title: onvened and ultimately certified the electoral votes in the early morning hours of January 7. Trump then released a statement asserting that there would be an \"orderly transition\" of power on Inauguration Day, even while continuing to claim falsely that the election was stolen from him and also stating that he would not attend Biden's inauguration.[18]) Considered scenarios\nFour scenarios for the removal of Trump from office had been posited by members of Congress, members of Trump's cabinet, political commentators, or legal scholars: resignation, the invocation of the 14th Amendment, invocation of the 25th Amendment, or impeachment and conviction.\nResignation\nThe President of the United States can resign from office, in which case the Vice President will automatically become president, instead of merely assuming the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president. While Article II of the Constitution states that the \"Powers and Duties\" of the president devolve to the vice president in the event of the president's death, resignation, incapacity, or removal, John Tyler, the tenth president of the United States, interpreted that provision as allowing the Vice President to ascend to the presidency in such cases, without any qualifications. This practice was codified in 1967, with the passage of the 25th Amendment.\nIf Trump had resigned, Vice President Mike Pence would have become the 46th president of the United States; Pence would have been the shortest-serving president ever, being in office for a matter of days before handing power to Joe Biden as the 47th president on January 20. This would have surpassed the record of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days into his term. It would have been the second time in history that a president had been forced to resign; the first was the 1974 resignation of Richard Nixon when it appeared inevitable that he would be impeached and removed from office for his role in the Watergate scandal.\nDue to intense pressure on his administration, the threat of removal, and numerous resignations, Trump committed to an orderly transition of power in a televised speech on January 7.[19] In the White House on January 8, Trump mentioned that he was not considering resignation.[20] On January 9, The New York Times reported that Trump told White House aides that he regretted his statement committing to an orderly transition of power and that there was no chance he would resign from office.[21]\n14th Amendment\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is one of the Reconstruction Amendments. It addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law, and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. Section 3 states that a person who participated in insurrection after having taken an oath to support the Constitution is disqualified from holding future office unless permitted by Congress.\nIf Trump had been removed from office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, Pence would have become the 46th president of the United States, and he would still have been the shortest-serving president ever before handing power to Biden as the 47th president on January 20. It would also have been the first time that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment had been invoked since 1919 when it stopped Victor L. Berger, convicted of violating the Espionage Act for his anti-militarist views, from taking his seat in the House of Representatives.[22] It would also have been the first time that it had been invoked on a sitting president and its being invoked had been seen as especially unlikely.[23]\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the House Democrats who supported invoking the 14th Amendment against Trump. In a letter, Pelosi thanked her colleagues for their contributions to discussions on the 14th Amendment.[24] If successful, the former president would be ineligible for appointment to any federal office without a Senate supermajority vote in favor.\n25th \nDoc 5(Title: hat requires documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration.)

The law boosts funding for punitive immigration enforcement, undermines access to education, strips away civil rights safeguards across multiple sectors, and advances massive cuts to programs like Medicaid, SNAP, and student financial aid — programs that millions of Americans, especially communities of color and low-income families, rely on.\nJuly 7: The Department of Labor formally withdrew a proposed regulation that would have ended its program to allow employers to pay people with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage, also known as subminimum wage. Currently, Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 allows employers to apply for certificates that permit them to pay employees with disabilities subminimum wage.\nJuly 7: The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sent a letter to the Texas governor and attorney general stating that four congressional districts — all held by Democrats — are based on unlawful racial gerrymandering, prompting the Texas legislature to call a special session to conduct redistricting later in the month.\nJuly 7: In two separate announcements, the Department of Homeland Security terminated Temporary Protected Status for Honduras and Nicaragua.\nJuly 8: The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement reportedly issued a memo stating that undocumented immigrants would no longer be eligible for bond hearings while they are facing deportation hearings, which could potentially apply to millions of immigrants. This policy change came only several days after Congress passed a bill giving the administration $45 billion to expand immigration detention.\nJuly 9: The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced a lawsuit against the state of California over the state’s policies allowing transgender students to compete on sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\nJuly 10: The acting director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memo to heads and acting heads of departments and agencies requiring all federal agencies to eliminate recognition throughout the executive branch of gender identity and to reinforce a binary definition of sex and gender, in accordance with Executive Order 14168.\nJuly 10: The White House announced a series of anti-immigrant actions that seek to block certain immigrant families from accessing a range of vital federal programs, including Head Start, mental health and substance abuse services, adult education programs, and the Title X family planning program.\nJuly 14: The Department of Justice issued guidance purporting to implement the president’s executive order that seeks to designate English as the nation’s official language and allow federal agencies to conduct all official business exclusively in English. Shamefully, the assistant attorney general for civil rights said the executive order “marks a pivotal step toward unifying our nation.” The guidance is wrong on the law, including by saying that Title VI doesn’t protect people with Limited English Proficiency from discrimination and that the landmark Lau v.

For the lecture, I conducted an extensive evidence review, mainly through Google, on the trends influencing the 2016 election, and on the election’s potential impact on US health care policy. This manuscript describes the findings of my evidence review, interprets and analyzes them, and offers perspectives on the implications not only for US health care but also the health of American democracy. Because the lecture took place prior to the November 8 election, this paper does not specifically comment on the results of the election, although the perspectives offered on how Donald S. Trump’s positions as a candidate, compared to those of former Secretary of State Hillary R. Rodham, are relevant to any conversation about what Mr. Trump’s election and continued Republican control of Congress bodes for health care policy.\nINTRODUCTION\nHunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, which chronicled the 1972 Nixon versus McGovern campaign, was described by the New York Times as “the best account yet published” of a modern American presidential campaign (1). “What makes the story so painful, and so painfully funny” writes Matt Taibbi in his introduction to the book’s 40th anniversary edition, “is that Hunter chooses the presidential campaign, of all places, to conduct this hopeless search for truth and justice. It’s probably worse now than it was in Hunter’s day, but the American presidential campaign is the last place in the world a sane man would go in search of anything like honesty. It may be the most fake place on earth” (2).\nThe same might be said of the 2016 election; an election characterized by personal attacks, misinformation, and relentless negativity, as voters are being asked to choose between two major party candidates who most distrust and view unfavorably—a “lesser of two evils” choice to many. This isn’t the first “lesser evils” election; in Fear and Loathing, Hunter wrote, “How many more of these stinking, double-downer sideshows will we have to go through before we can get ourselves straight enough to put together some kind of national election that will give me and the at least 20 million people I tend to agree with a chance to vote FOR something, instead of always being faced with that old familiar choice between the lesser of two evils?” (1)\nYet, like the choices or not, the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or businessman Donald S. Trump will result in starkly different outcomes for America’s health care system. It’s not just health care that is at stake; it’s the health of our democratic system of government itself.\nThe anger and distrust evidenced by large swaths of the electorate today, and the poisonous atmosphere that it has introduced into the election, didn’t just suddenly arise. It came about because of four trends—reactions to changing demographics; distrust of government; partisanship and gridlock; and now, populism—that have been gathering steam for decades, only to come to a head in this election.\nCHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS\n“The U.S. electorate this year will be the country’s most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Nearly one-in-three eligible voters on Election Day (31%) will be Hispanic, black, Asian o\nDoc 4(Title: hat requires documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration.) July 1: The Department of Labor proposed rescinding requirements within Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act for federal contractors and subcontractors to strengthen their recruiting, hiring, and accommodating of disabled people.\nJuly 2: President Trump announced the nominations of Eric Tung to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (California), Joshua Dunlap to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Maine), and William Mercer to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana.\nJuly 4: President Trump signed the reconciliation bill into law. The law boosts funding for punitive immigration enforcement, undermines access to education, strips away civil rights safeguards across multiple sectors, and advances massive cuts to programs like Medicaid, SNAP, and student financial aid — programs that millions of Americans, especially communities of color and low-income families, rely on.\nJuly 7: The Department of Labor formally withdrew a proposed regulation that would have ended its program to allow employers to pay people with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage, also known as subminimum wage. Currently, Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 allows employers to apply for certificates that permit them to pay employees with disabilities subminimum wage.\nJuly 7: The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sent a letter to the Texas governor and attorney general stating that four congressional districts — all held by Democrats — are based on unlawful racial gerrymandering, prompting the Texas legislature to call a special session to conduct redistricting later in the month.\nJuly 7: In two separate announcements, the Department of Homeland Security terminated Temporary Protected Status for Honduras and Nicaragua.\nJuly 8: The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement reportedly issued a memo stating that undocumented immigrants would no longer be eligible for bond hearings while they are facing deportation hearings, which could potentially apply to millions of immigrants. This policy change came only several days after Congress passed a bill giving the administration $45 billion to expand immigration detention.\nJuly 9: The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced a lawsuit against the state of California over the state’s policies allowing transgender students to compete on sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\nJuly 10: The acting director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memo to heads and acting heads of departments and agencies requiring all federal agencies to eliminate recognition throughout the executive branch of gender identity and to reinforce a binary definition of sex and gender, in accordance with Executive Order 14168.\nJuly 10: The White House announced a series of anti-immigrant actions that seek to block certain immigrant families from accessing a range of vital federal programs, including Head Start, mental health and substance abuse services, adult education programs, and the Title X family planning program.\nJuly 14: The Department of Justice issued guidance purporting to implement the president’s executive order that seeks to designate English as the nation’s official language and allow federal agencies to conduct all official business exclusively in English. Shamefully, the assistant attorney general for civil rights said the executive order “marks a pivotal step toward unifying our nation.” The guidance is wrong on the law, including by saying that Title VI doesn’t protect people with Limited English Proficiency from discrimination and that the landmark Lau v. Nichols Supreme Court decision was overruled by Sandoval.\nJuly 14: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed revising the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to remove questions about sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) and \nDoc 5(Title:  paid more than $67,000 by Russian companies before the 2016 presidential election.) - Jeff Sessions: Sessions, President Trump's Attorney General, had two conversations with Ambassador Kislyak during the 2016 presidential election. However, during later confirmation hearings, he claimed that he \"did not have communications with the Russians\" when prompted by Senator Al Franken. Once reports of his meetings with Kislyak surfaced, Sessions recused himself from any investigation into Russia's interference in our 2016 presidential election. Many officials are continuing to call for his resignation.\n- Rex Tillerson: Tillerson, President Trump's former Secretary of State, worked on energy projects in Russia for two decades during his career at Exxon. He has publicly described his \"very close relationship\" with President Putin and was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013, the highest state honor possible for a foreigner.\n- Jared Kushner: Kushner is President Trump's son-in-law and current Senior Advisor. Along with Michael Flynn, Kushner met with Ambassador Kislyak during the Presidential transition. The White House later acknowledged that following that meeting, Ambassador Kislyak requested a second meeting, which Kushner had a deputy attend. However, at Kislyak's request, Kushner did later meet with Sergey Gorkov, the head of Russia's state-owned development bank, who has close ties to President Putin. The U.S. placed this bank on its sanctions list following Russia's annexation of Crimea. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to question Kushner about his meetings with Russian officials. The New York Times recently reported that Kusher failed to disclose dozens of contacts with foreign leaders on his application for top-secret security clearance -- one of those contacts being Ambassador Kislyak.\n- Donald Trump, Jr.: Trump, Jr., President Trump's son, met with Fabien Baussart, a leader of a Syrian opposition group backed by the Russian government, and others about how the U.S. could work with Russia on the Syrian conflict weeks before Donald Trump was elected President. He has also been quoted saying that his father's businesses \"see a lot of money pouring in from Russia\", and that he had visited Russia on business over a half-dozen times. In June 2016, he met with a Russian billionaire, Emin Agalarov, under the premise that Emin had \"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia\" from the Crown prosecutor of Russia, and that this was part of \"Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n- Paul Manafort: Manafort, who has business connections to Russia and Ukraine, was hired as Trump's campaign manager in March 2016. He then resigned in August of the same year, after reports surfaced that suggested he had received $12.7 million from Victor Yanukovych, Ukraine's pro-Russia former president. It was recently revealed by AP that Manafort proposed in a strategy plan from as early as June 2005 that he would work to influence politics, business deals, and media inside the U.S. and Europe to benefit Putin. This plan was pitched to Oleg Deripaska, a \"Russian aluminum magnate\" with close ties to Putin. Manafort eventually signed a $10 million contract with Deripaska in early 2006. The Trump Administration and Manafort have both said that Manafort never worked for Russian interests. Since the FBI confirmed in a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 20 that investigators are examining whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, the White House has made attempts to distance itself from Manafort, claiming that he played \"a very limited role\" in the campaign, despite his clear leadership role as campaign chairman leading up to the Republican National Convention. On October 27, 2017, Manafort was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy against the United States, among other charges.\n- Ca\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the documents provided, it seems the cabinet picks foreshadow a presidency that will likely prioritize conservative policies, particularly those related to economic and social issues. For instance, appointing judges who support conservative ideologies and issuing executive orders that roll back progressive policies indicates a strong inclination towards traditional values and policies. \n\nTo determine the amount of power each cabinet member holds, these roles typically involve advising the President and managing specific areas of government operations, with significant influence but ultimately reporting to the President. They can propose policies, oversee agencies, and implement laws but are constrained by the President’s authority.\n\n<answer> conservative policies </answer>\n\nGiven the information, the cabinet picks seem to indicate a focus on conservative policies.

In a letter, Pelosi thanked her colleagues for their contributions to discussions on the 14th Amendment.[24] If successful, the former president would be ineligible for appointment to any federal office without a Senate supermajority vote in favor.) 25th Amendment\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution deals with presidential succession and disability. Though the amendment thus far has been used in medical situations, Section 4 provides that the vice president, together with a majority of Cabinet secretaries, may declare the president unable to carry out his duties, after which the vice president immediately assumes the duties of the president.\nIf Section 4 of the 25th Amendment action had been carried out, it would have made Pence the acting president, assuming the \"powers and duties of the office\" of the president. Trump would have remained president for the rest of his term, albeit stripped of all authority. Section 4 of the 25th Amendment had not been invoked before.[25][26] The 25th Amendment, however, was initially created for the case where the president was incapacitated.\nPence, who would have been required to initiate assuming the president's powers and duties, stated that he would not invoke the 25th Amendment against Trump.[27]\nImpeachment and conviction\nImpeachment begins in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drawn up. These articles are then voted on by House members. Each article is voted on separately and requires a simple majority to pass. Once an article has been passed in the House, the president has been impeached. The articles are then sent to the Senate for adjudication with an impeachment trial. After views have been laid out in the trial, the Senate moves to vote on conviction. Each article requires a two-thirds majority of Senators present to pass. If an article passes in the Senate, the president has been convicted and is removed from office. Once the president is convicted, a further vote may then be held which determines whether the (now-former) president is barred from holding future office; this vote passes with a simple majority in the Senate.[28][29]\nBecause the Senate was not scheduled to reconvene until January 19, 2021,[30] members of Congress discussed holding the trial after Trump had left office. A former president had never been tried by the Senate; however, Secretary of War William W. Belknap had been impeached by the House and tried by the Senate after he had resigned.[4]\nInvoking the 25th Amendment\nOn the evening of January 6, CBS News reported that Cabinet members were discussing invoking the 25th Amendment.[31] The ten Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by U.S. Representative David Cicilline, sent a letter to Pence to \"emphatically urge\" him to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\", claiming that he incited and condoned the riots.[32][33] For invocation, Pence and at least eight Cabinet members, forming a simple majority, would have to consent. Additionally, if challenged by Trump, the second invocation would maintain Pence as acting president, subject to a vote of approval in both houses of Congress, with a two-thirds supermajority necessary in each chamber to sustain. However, Congress would not have needed to act before January 20 for Pence to remain acting president until Biden was inaugurated, per the timeline described in Section 4.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D–MA) accused Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in a tweet of quitting rather than supporting efforts to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump.[34] A Trump administration official disputed Warren's claim.[34] House majority whip Jim Clyburn on Friday accused DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao of \"running away from their responsibility\" by resigning from President Trump's Cabinet before invoking the 25th Amendment to strip him of his powers a\nDoc 2(Title: Americans express highly negative views of elected officials – and have grown increasingly pessimistic about their congressional representatives over the past several years. In fact, views of Congress, congressional leadership, the current and former president, and the vice president are all underwater.) When asked about various aspects of the job those in Congress are doing, such as working with members of the opposing parties or caring about the people they represent, Americans are critical on nearly every domain.\nViews of members of Congress\nOpinions about Congress are largely negative; just 26% of U.S. adults have a favorable view of Congress, while 72% have an unfavorable view.\nServing the public interest and people in their districts\nThe public also is critical of how members of Congress do their jobs – and in some cases these criticisms have increased in recent years:\n- In 2018, half of adults said members of Congress care about the people they represent all, most or some of the time. Today, 38% say the same. A majority say that members of Congress care about their constituents “only a little” or none of the time.\n- There has been a similar decline in the share of adults who say members of Congress do a good job promoting laws and policies that serve the public interest. Five years ago, 47% said congressional members do this at least some of the time. Today, just 36% say that members of Congress promote the public interest.\nOn both evaluations, positive views have declined among Republicans and Democrats alike. About four-in-ten members of both parties say members of Congress care about the people they represent all or most of time. Roughly half said this in 2018.\nThere have been similar declines in the shares of Republicans and Democrats who say the members do a good job promoting policies that serve the public interest.\nAcross many dimensions, public rates members of Congress poorly\nAt least three-quarters or more say that members of Congress do a somewhat or very bad job at listening to the concerns of people in their district (76%), keeping their personal financial interests separate from their work in Congress (81%), working with members of the opposing party (84%) and taking responsibility for their actions (86%).\nThe public is especially negative when it comes to whether members of Congress take responsibility for their actions. Nearly nine-in-ten say congressional members do a bad job taking responsibility – including about half (49%) who say they do a very bad job at this.\nViews across these items are deeply negative among nearly all demographic groups – including by gender, age, race and education.\nAssessments of members of Congress differ little by party. Majorities of Republicans and Democrats alike – including those who lean to each party – say that members of Congress do a poor job keeping their personal financial interests separate from their work in Congress (84% of Republicans, 79% of Democrats) or listening to the concerns of people in their district (78% of Republicans, 74% of Democrats).\nSimilarly, at least eight-in-ten Republicans and Democrats say that members of Congress do a bad job taking responsibility for their actions or working with members of the opposing party.\nAge and views of elected officials\nFor the most part, views of congressional job performance are broadly negative across demographic groups. Yet adults ages 65 and older offer more positive evaluations in some specific areas.\nNearly half of those 65 and older (48%) say members of Congress care about the people they represent at least some of the time. Far fewer adults under 65 say the same – including just a third of those under 30.\nWhile 45% of Americans 65 and older say members of Congress do a good job promoting policies and laws that serve the public interest, this compares with 36% of those ages 50 to 64, 35% of those 30 to 49 and just 31% of adults under 30.\nOlder adults were slightly more positive on these assessments of Congr\nDoc 3(Title: 45% of Americans 65 and older say members of Congress do a good job promoting policies and laws that serve the public interest, this compares with 36% of those ages 50 to 64, 35% of those 30 to 49 and just 31% of adults under 30.) Older adults were slightly more positive on these assessments of Congress than their younger counterparts, but age differences are either small or nonexistent when it comes to the other items asked about on the survey.\nIn their own words: Americans’ views of the major problems with today’s elected officials\nWhen asked in an open-ended question about the biggest problem with elected officials today, adults point to a variety of issues – ranging from a lack of focus on the people they represent to mentions of negative character traits, general incompetence and the role of partisanship in officials’ ability to get things done.\nOne recurring theme is a sense that elected officials today are not in touch with the people they represent or do not advocate for the issues that matter to their constituents.\nA third of adults express this view, including 11% who feel elected officials are too influenced by money and 9% who say they are corrupt. “Their end goals are personal and not for the betterment of the voters who elected them,” says a man in his 60s.\nAnother man in his 20s believes elected officials are “too out of touch with the public. They’re too obsessed with money and power, so they don’t care about the people anymore.”\nRoughly three-in-ten adults mention negative personal traits of elected officials, saying that elected officials are dishonest or self-centered. One woman in her 60s says they have “no empathy, and are unable to see both sides of the picture … [they’re] not truthful.”\nExplore more voices: Americans’ views of their elected officials\nWhat do you see as the biggest problem with elected officials today?\n“They bend to whomever can donate most to their campaign and don’t follow through on campaign promises.” –Man, 30s\n“Lack of awareness and understanding of today’s political and social landscape. Old politicians with old money don’t understand the issues of today, leading to a huge disconnect with the public’s priorities and theirs.” –Woman, 20s\n“Greed. Greed. Greed. Power leads to greed.” –Woman, 70s\n“No accountability and they all think they are rockstars.” –Man, 30s\n“They are focused on donor money and preventing the ‘other side’ from making advancements instead of governing in a way that helps all constituents.” –Woman, 40s\n“Too much ego and not caring enough to listen to us.” –Woman, 50s\n“Power hungry. Money hungry. Lazy. Liars.” –Man, 40s\n“Many are self-serving, misdirected and too partisan. They have lost common sense, love of country, and have no moral core.” –Woman, 70s\n“They do not serve the people, they serve themselves and special interests, and lie to our faces about their priorities.” –Man, 40s\nThe influence of partisanship is another theme mentioned by 15% of adults. Most Americans who cite issues along this theme point to the inability of elected officials to get things done due to polarization or loyalty to one’s party.\nThe biggest problem with today’s elected officials, according to one woman in her 50s, is “the idea that what we want is for them to fight for whatever they believe in at all costs, rather than compromise and actually accomplish something. I can’t think of another profession where you can get paid for refusing to do anything.”\n“They are not willing to speak to anyone across the aisle,” says another man in his 40s. “It is their party or nothing.”\nMany of these themes were echoed in a survey conducted in 2015 – reflecting a persistent skepticism among members of the public that elected officials do not hold office for the betterment of the people they represent, but for the benefit of themselves. Eight years ago, sizable shares of adults said that elected officials were out of touch with people or too influenced by money and special interests.\nHow much do electe\nDoc 4(Title: ublic that elected officials do not hold office for the betterment of the people they represent, but for the benefit of themselves.

Just 14% say they do care.\nIn the early 1990s, about a third of adults said elected officials cared about people like them – a share that declined steadily into the 2010s.\nSkepticism that most elected officials care about the public is evident among Americans regardless of gender, race, age, education, partisanship or political engagement. For example, 84% of those who are highly engaged with politics say that elected officials don’t care what people like them think. This compares with 87% of those who are less engaged with politics.\nDoc 5(Title:  the original on January 12, 2021.

In a letter, Pelosi thanked her colleagues for their contributions to discussions on the 14th Amendment.[24] If successful, the former president would be ineligible for appointment to any federal office without a Senate supermajority vote in favor.) 25th Amendment\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution deals with presidential succession and disability. Though the amendment thus far has been used in medical situations, Section 4 provides that the vice president, together with a majority of Cabinet secretaries, may declare the president unable to carry out his duties, after which the vice president immediately assumes the duties of the president.\nIf Section 4 of the 25th Amendment action had been carried out, it would have made Pence the acting president, assuming the \"powers and duties of the office\" of the president. Trump would have remained president for the rest of his term, albeit stripped of all authority. Section 4 of the 25th Amendment had not been invoked before.[25][26] The 25th Amendment, however, was initially created for the case where the president was incapacitated.\nPence, who would have been required to initiate assuming the president's powers and duties, stated that he would not invoke the 25th Amendment against Trump.[27]\nImpeachment and conviction\nImpeachment begins in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drawn up. These articles are then voted on by House members. Each article is voted on separately and requires a simple majority to pass. Once an article has been passed in the House, the president has been impeached. The articles are then sent to the Senate for adjudication with an impeachment trial. After views have been laid out in the trial, the Senate moves to vote on conviction. Each article requires a two-thirds majority of Senators present to pass. If an article passes in the Senate, the president has been convicted and is removed from office. Once the president is convicted, a further vote may then be held which determines whether the (now-former) president is barred from holding future office; this vote passes with a simple majority in the Senate.[28][29]\nBecause the Senate was not scheduled to reconvene until January 19, 2021,[30] members of Congress discussed holding the trial after Trump had left office. A former president had never been tried by the Senate; however, Secretary of War William W. Belknap had been impeached by the House and tried by the Senate after he had resigned.[4]\nInvoking the 25th Amendment\nOn the evening of January 6, CBS News reported that Cabinet members were discussing invoking the 25th Amendment.[31] The ten Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by U.S. Representative David Cicilline, sent a letter to Pence to \"emphatically urge\" him to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\", claiming that he incited and condoned the riots.[32][33] For invocation, Pence and at least eight Cabinet members, forming a simple majority, would have to consent. Additionally, if challenged by Trump, the second invocation would maintain Pence as acting president, subject to a vote of approval in both houses of Congress, with a two-thirds supermajority necessary in each chamber to sustain. However, Congress would not have needed to act before January 20 for Pence to remain acting president until Biden was inaugurated, per the timeline described in Section 4.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D–MA) accused Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in a tweet of quitting rather than supporting efforts to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump.[34] A Trump administration official disputed Warren's claim.[34] House majority whip Jim Clyburn on Friday accused DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao of \"running away from their responsibility\" by resigning from President Trump's Cabinet before invoking the 25th Amendment to strip him of his powers a\nDoc 2(Title: Americans express highly negative views of elected officials – and have grown increasingly pessimistic about their congressional representatives over the past several years.

And how can we stop this from happening again in the future?\nPublic pressure\nNaming and shaming a company which has done wrong can help to damage that company’s reputation, as well as potentially scaring their shareholders into demanding action.\nAs consumers increasingly adjust their shopping habits based on environmental and ethical concerns, companies need to make sure they do not end up on the wrong side of public opinion.\nHowever, when corporate wrongdoing is exposed, these companies are often more preoccupied with making the negative publicity go away rather than actually addressing the problem.\nIf companies are found to be complicit in deforestation, for example, they will announce a new \"environmental sustainability\" policy, or that they’ve joined a voluntary initiative to keep forests standing.\nBut these commitments are not binding, and as soon as the public pressure has died down they can quietly slip back into their old habits.\nAt the same time, many of the worst offenders do not have a reputation to maintain. Every day, many harms are being perpetuated by companies which are little known to the public. For example, commodity traders that don’t sell directly to consumers, but who are the main drivers of destruction behind the scenes as intermediaries.\nIn any event, most consumers will only know of a handful of high-profile corporate misconduct cases. And modern supply chains are so bewilderingly complex that it’s highly impractical or downright impossible for people to do their own research into the ethical implications of a product’s origins before putting it in their shopping basket.\nFor example, if you wanted to have some Nutella on your toast for breakfast, you would need to conduct investigations in five separate countries just to find the source of the raw ingredients, not to mention the processing and transportation practices.\nAnd that’s just for a relatively simple product. For more complex products like an iPhone, the components of which are sourced from suppliers in 43 countries over six continents, it would be difficult to finish your research before the next model was released.\nRegulation\nIt should not be the responsibility of consumers to research every potential purchase to make sure they are not unwittingly buying into environmental destruction or human rights abuses.\nThe companies themselves are best placed to identify and tackle these risks, and should therefore be required by law to prove that their business activities are not causing harms of this kind. We call this regulatory approach \"mandatory due diligence\".\nA due diligence law must come with financial penalties to hit lawbreaking companies where it hurts – in their pocket.\nMore importantly, communities which have been harmed by a company’s actions (who are for the most part located in the Global South) must be able to access courts to seek compensation and other forms of relief from the companies which have caused this destruction.\nIt is vital for affected communities be able to seek effective remedies when their rights have been violated.\nMany of the companies causing the most damage around the world have their headquarters in the UK, EU and USA, or make a significant amount of their profit in those markets.\nIf legislators in these places passed strong mand\nDoc 2(Title: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Statement for the Record Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community) \n large-**_\n\n_**scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely**_\n\n_**affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support.**_\n\nAlthough the international community has made tenuous improvements to global health security,\n\nthese gains may be inadequate to address the challenge of what we anticipate will be more frequent\n\noutbreaks of infectious diseases because of rapid unplanned urbanization, prolonged humanitarian\n\ncrises, human incursion into previously unsettled land, expansion of international travel and trade,\n\nand regional climate change.\n\n• The ongoing crisis in Venezuela has reversed gains in controlling infectious diseases, such as\n\ndiphtheria, malaria, measles, and tuberculosis, increasing the risk that these diseases could\n\nspread to neighboring countries, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nSimilarly, the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the country’s\n\nlargest ever—underscores the risks posed by the nexus of infectious disease outbreaks, violent\n\nconflict, and high population density, including large numbers of internally displaced person\n\n(IDPs).\n\n• In the past two years, progress against malaria has halted after more than 15 years of steady\n\nreductions, in part because mosquitos and the pathogen have developed a resistance to\n\ninsecticides and to antimalarial drugs, respectively, while global funding to combat the disease\n\nhas plateaued.\n\n• The growing proximity of humans and animals has increased the risk of disease transmission.\n\nThe number of outbreaks has increased in part because pathogens originally found in animals\n\nhave spread to human populations.\n\n22\n\nHuman Displacement\n\n_**Global displacement almost certainly will remain near record highs, and host countries are unlikely to see**_\n\n_**many refugees or internally displaced persons return home, increasing humanitarian needs and the risk of**_\n\n_**political upheaval, health crises, and recruitment and radicalization by militant groups.**_ The number of\n\npeople becoming displaced within their own national borders continues to increase, according to the\n\nUnited Nations, placing fiscal and political strain on governments’ ability to care for their domestic\n\npopulations and mitigate local discontent.\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n_**Violations of religious freedom by governments and nonstate actors—particularly in the Middle East,**_\n\n_**China, and North Korea—will fuel the growth of violent extremist groups and lead to societal tensions,**_\n\n_**protests, or political turmoil.**_\n\n• According to the Pew Research Center’s global indexes, the average score for government\n\nrestrictions on religion rose 39 percent from 2007 to 2016, and the number of states with high or\n\nvery high government restrictions grew from 40 to 55.\n\n• Since 2017, Chinese authorities have detained hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of\n\nTurkic Muslim Uighurs in extrajudicial detainment centers.

Also, disease is a constant concern and can render entire ponds completely worthless. Initially, governments were ill-equipped to regulate this type of farming, and farmers were unaware of the destruction they were causing. But now some countries and individual farmers are taking action and changing their practices. Thailand, the top shrimp exporter for much of the early 2000s, now has stricter regulations that restrict new farms from encroaching on mangroves. The devastating tsunami of 2004 was a wakeup call for many countries that were impacted by the wave’s surge and had exposed coastlines from mangrove removal.) Despite recent efforts to make shrimp farming sustainable, it is still a destructive enterprise that is threatening the existence of mangroves around the world.\nSea Level Rise\nAs global temperatures rise so will sea level. It’s a phenomenon that is expected to cause trouble for mangroves across the globe. During past changes in sea level, mangroves were able to move further inland, but in many places human development is now a barrier that limits how far a mangrove forest can migrate. Moreover, mangroves rely on mud buildup from rivers to help them make the transition, but studies suggest that in at least some parts of the world, mud isn’t building up fast enough compared to the rate of sea level rise. Areas of the Sundarban mangrove forest have experienced unusually high tides and as a result high levels of erosion. A 2013 study found that 71 percent of the forest is experiencing 656 feet (200 meters) of coastline retreat per year, almost the length of two football fields. And in 2024, a study by the IUCN found that 50 percent of the world's mangroves are at risk of collapse. In 2006, two nearby archipelagos were washed away, an illustration that the threat of the entire forest vanishing beneath the ocean is a real concern.\nAs for their ability to evolve in the face of a major stressor, like sea level rise, genetic diversity is key for a species to adapt to change. Although mangrove populations have flourished in that last 6,000 years, a past change in sea level during the retreat of the glaciers roughly 20,000 years ago, potentially killed a majority of their population. Mangroves have not recovered from this event, as indicated by a very low levels of genetic variability. This low diversity means that mangroves of a single species are so similar that the genetic makeup of one individual is almost identical to its neighbor.\nHowever, the recent El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Basin has shown that sea levels can also drop precipitiously and have severe impacts on mangrove forests. Extensive mangrove diebacks in Australia along the Bay of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory and at Exmouth in Western Australia have been linked to a 14 inch (35 cm) drop in sea level, which when coupled with prolonged drought, left mangroves high and dry long enough to cause extensive mangrove death.\nInvasive Species\nThe ocean is teeming with plants and animals willing and able to move beyond their native habitats, sometimes with the help of humans. Some of these invasive species are encroaching upon the habitats of mangroves. In China, a marsh grass called Spartina alterniflora was introduced in 1979 by conservationists trying to decrease coastal erosion. Originally from the Atlantic coast, the grass works well at maintaining banks and tidal flats, but in China, it began to spread uncontrollably and is now taking over the mangrove forests. Invasive animals can also pose a threat to mangrove forests. An exotic antelope from Asia called the nilgai was released in Texas in the United States in the 1930s as hunting game and is now not only a nuisance for cattle ranchers, but it also eats mangrove leaves. And the addition of rats and feral cats to the Galapagos Islands has caused mangrove finch populations to dramatically decline to a point where they are now listed as critically endangered.\nMangroves themselves c\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems clear that there are multiple ways countries can be involved in preventing the destruction of global resources such as the rainforest.

President Donald Trump’s refusal to disclose his tax returns throughout his campaigns and presidency has fueled multiple legislative public disclosure proposals. In March 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation as part of the For the People Act of 2021 that would require Presidents, Vice Presidents, and nominees to publicly disclose several years of their tax returns through the Federal Election Commission. Many state legislatures have considered similar requirements for candidates who seek to appear on state primary and general election ballots. Proponents of these measures argue that public disclosure of tax returns could expose conflicts of interest, reveal the President’s and candidates’ annual tax liability and tax rates, and, most importantly, enable the public to observe whether the President or candidates have engaged in tax evasion, pursued tax shelters and other tax avoidance, and participated in audits or tax controversies with the IRS.) This Article intervenes in the disclosure debate by exploring whether, and to what extent, mandatory public disclosure of tax returns would achieve the policy objective of enabling voters to observe candidates’ and elected officials’ compliance with the tax law. To consider this question, the Article examines information presented in federal income tax returns and reviews the publicly disclosed tax returns of Presidents, Vice Presidents, and major party candidates from President Richard Nixon through President Joseph Biden. The primary claim of this Article is that mandatory public disclosure of an elected official’s or candidate’s federal income tax returns alone would provide the public with only a partial and one-sided view of that individual’s tax compliance. This incomplete image is due to the structure of the federal income tax and tax returns themselves and opportunities for strategic reporting and disclosure by elected officials and candidates.\nAt the same time, the Article argues that public disclosure of tax compliance, if it were possible, could provide valuable information to the electorate, increase public understanding of the tax system, and enable public oversight over the taxing authority. To enhance the public’s ability to evaluate tax compliance, the Article presents an alternative model of mandatory public disclosure that would include public disclosure not only of tax returns, but also of documents and processes that would highlight tax actions of both candidates and elected officials and the IRS.\nProfessor of Law and Faculty Director of Strategic Initiatives, University of California, Irvine School of Law.\nDoc 2(Title: Wyden Offers Bill Calling On President-Elect Trump, Future Presidential Nominees To Release Tax Returns) Measure would give insight into foreign deals, increase transparency\nWASHINGTON - Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today introduced a bill requiring President-Elect Trump to release his recent tax returns in order to give the public honest insight into the President-Elect's actions, values and foreign business dealings.\n\"The fact that the president-elect refuses to release his tax returns is a tragic failure of transparency, and it needs to be corrected.

It also requires that, within 15 days of becoming the nominee at the party convention, presidential nominees must release their most recent 3 years of tax returns to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Should the sitting president or future candidates refuse to comply, the Treasury Secretary will be required to provide the tax returns directly to the OGE or FEC respectively for public release.\n\"President-Elect Trump's tax returns will deliver honest answers to key questions from the American public,\" said Wyden. \"Are you keeping your money offshore?

If any President mistakes\n\nhimself for the actual force itself, sees himself as\n\nbeing the law, or being above the law, rather than\n\nseeing himself as a temporary wielder of the force for\n\nthe good of the People who provide the force to\n\n29\n\ngovernment, this would not be American.

(If the sequelae of criminal\n\nacts distract the criminal: don’t commit criminal acts\n\nin the first place! or, leave the kitchen if the heat is\n\ntoo great.) After all, it is a sort of treason for the\n\nPresident to be committing crimes in the first\n\nplace—when he is supposed to be the First Role\n\nModel for Americans—, or for him even to want to\n\ndisrespect the American people by putting himself\n\nabove investigation of his possible crimes.\n\nOn that note: _The Tragedy of Coriolanus_ tells the\n\nstory of one poignantly tragic traitor, the noble\n\nRoman called Caius Martius Coriolanus. As\n\nShakespeare relates, Coriolanus, _see id._, fights\n\nfiercely for Rome, but loses his political position\n\nbecause of his arrogance; then defects to the\n\nVolscians of Corioles and leads them against Rome,\n\nand finally turns and betrays the Volscians.

Trump did not return the material voluntarily and submit to an investigation. He hid material. He had his lawyers lie to investigators. It required a search warrant to recover a great deal of the classified material—and prosecutors are still not sure they recovered all of it. There were repeated acts of obstruction that involved several other people who worked at Mar-a-Lago. These are acts that prosecutors will indict irrespective of the merits of the underlying crime.) What Should Be Done?\nThe story Hur tells speaks to two policy problems that are larger than Biden and that really need to be addressed. The first is the problem of the difficulty Biden’s staff had when he was vice president recovering and storing the classified material he used in non-secure locations. There is nothing illegal or improper about this behavior on Biden’s part; the vice president works everywhere and he is not covered by the normal rules of handling classified material. The problem is a staffing issue. When the vice president reads classified briefing material at home, who will make sure it’s stored properly? When he travels with it and takes it to Delaware—which he is entitled to do—who will make sure it is recovered and returned to a proper storage location?\nA second policy issue involves Biden’s diaries. Biden is correct that other presidents and vice presidents before him have treated their personal diaries, classified information and all, as personal property and taken them with them when they leave office. That said, storing diaries full of highly sensitive material in unsecured locations is completely unacceptable—whatever the property interests may be in the books themselves. An expectation that the National Archives becomes the custodian of such material, or that it builds appropriate storage for it at the houses of former presidents and vice presidents seems appropriate. And more broadly, there clearly needs to be a better process for making sure classified material doesn’t leave with former presidents and vice presidents during transitions.\nBut there’s a level here that is not about policy. It is about behavior. And it’s behavior for which Biden needs to take responsibility. Biden struck a defiant tone in response to the report, angry not merely at the suggestion that his memory was flawed but at the very notion that he had mishandled classified material. During the press conference Biden held following the release of the report, he insisted, “I did not share classified information. I did not share it … [w]ith my ghostwriter, I did not. Guarantee you, I did not.”\nThe facts of the report belie his indignance. Biden may not imagine himself as the sort of man who mishandles classified material, but he did, in fact, do so. And he should acknowledge that. As former CIA Acting Director Michael Morell put it this weekend on CBS’s Face the Nation:\nSo, I agree, 100 percent, that we need a new policy for how this is done at the end of administrations. A hundred percent. I think he needs to go a little bit further in the apology. I think he needs to say, I should not have had this material, I put national security at risk. I apologize to the American people for that. I apologize to the intelligence community, in particular to those CIA officers who put their lives at risk to collect some of it. There was CIA material in here. And it's not going to happen again. And I'm going to make sure of that by making changes. A more full- throated apology.\nSuch a statement would further distinguish Biden’s case from Trump’s.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, there are debates around the necessity of releasing tax returns for transparency purposes. Multiple bills and resolutions have been proposed to mandate tax returns disclosure, emphasizing the importance of transparency regarding financial dealings, conflicts of interest, and tax compliance.

A recent poll indicated that a substantial percentage of American citizens would be willing to give up some protections of the Bill of Rights in order to control illegal drug use.\nSeveral years ago Congress passed a law authorizing federal authorities to confiscate the property of individuals suspected of trafficking in drugs. Such property could be seized on mere suspicion. Individuals whose property had been seized could appeal and seek a return of their property, but the burden of proof rested on them to prove their innocence.\nAdvocates of this law argued its constitutionality on the grounds that the government was not acting against the suspected individuals, only against their property. Since only individuals, and not property, enjoy the protection of the Bill of Rights, they said, the law did not violate the Constitution.\nSince going into effect the law has proved controversial. Congress may repeal it. Do you think it should be repealed? Even if the constitutionality of such a law is upheld, should the government have such power? How would you determine the circumstances in which protections guaranteed by the Constitution should be curtailed by the government?\n- How do the following statements apply to this situation? What principles and ideals are implied in each statement? How, if at all, do these principles conflict with each other?\n- \"No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....\" Fifth Amendment\n- \"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than one innocent person suffer.\" William Blackstone\n- \"Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.\" Reinhold Niebuhr\n- \"The mood and temper of the public in the treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of civilization of any country.\" Winston Churchill\n- \"No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....\" Fifth Amendment\n- Which, if any, of these statements do you find most persuasive?

Diversity\nIs a common language essential to the survival of American democracy? One of the most controversial aspects of diversity in America has to do with language. Throughout our history English has been the principal language of the country. For millions of immigrants, learning English was an important first step to becoming a U.S. citizen.\nSchools must teach immigrant children who speak languages other than English. Educators differ about how best to accomplish their tasks. Moreover, a large percentage of recent immigrants use Spanish as their first language. In certain areas of the country Spanish is as commonly spoken as English. We are becoming, many believe, a bilingual nation.\n- How do the following statements apply to this situation? What\nDoc 3(Title:  ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care, and to the complete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible, free from every other control, but a regard to the public good and to the sense of the people.\" Alexander Hamilton) - \"I own I am not a friend to a very energetic government.

Explain the reasons for your position in terms of the situation itself and in terms of the principles involved.\nCritical Thinking Exercise #6\nCapital Punishment and the Constitution\nWith the exception of the issue of separation of church and state, no issue has focused so sharply the question of constitutional interpretation and the role of the judiciary in making such interpretation as the death penalty. Shortly before his retirement in 1994, Justice Harry Blackmun announced that he would no longer vote in favor of implementation of the death penalty. While he did not exactly say that capital punishment was unconstitutional, his remarks suggested that because the death penalty had become so repugnant to him, he would no longer have anything to do with its enforcement.\nJustice Blackmun's remarks were controversial, in part because of the strong opinions on the death penalty issue in the United States. They also were controversial because of what they suggested about how the words of the Constitution should be interpreted and the degree to which a judge's subjectivity should influence that interpretation.\nIs the death penalty constitutional? Its opponents say no. They maintain that the penalty itself violates the \"cruel and unusual punishment\" of the Eighth Amendment- both the manner of taking life and the long delays that usually accompany it. Opponents also have argued that implementation of capital punishment violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since its application falls disproportionately on the poor and minorities.\nOther citizens, including some who are opposed to the death penalty as a policy, say it is constitutional. The text of the Constitution, they argue, makes clear that the Framers clearly intended to allow for capital punishment. It is up to the people through their representatives-and not to judges-to decide on whether or not to employ this option.\nIf you were a justice on the Supreme Court, how would you approach this issue? What outlook and criteria would you use to interpret the words of the Framers? What would you consider to be the proper role of judges in addressing this issue? Would you take a different position if you were a legislator?\n- How do the following statements apply to this situation? What principles and ideals are implied in each statement? How, if at all, do these principles conflict with each other?\n- \"...nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" Eighth Amendment\n- \"No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes.\" Hannah Arendt\n- \"No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...\" Fifth Amendment\n- \"Then thou shall give for a life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth....\" Exodus, 21:23-24\n- \"Thou shalt not kill\" Exodus, 20:13\n- \"...nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" Eighth Amendment\n- What is the difference between the constitutional principles, a and c, and the passages from the Bible, d and e? What is it about these ideas that allows people to reach opposing points of view? Because something is legal, does that make it moral?\n- Which, if any, of these statements do you find most persuasive? Why?\n- What is your position on this issue? Explain the reasons for your position in\nDoc 4(Title: Inmates under the care and custody of a local, state, or federal correctional authority are generally housed in one of two types of facilities – a local jail or a state or federal prison. BJS collects data on the administration and operation of both types of facilities.) - Jails confine persons before or after adjudication and are usually operated by local law enforcement authorities such as a sheriff, a police chief, or a county or city administrator. A small number of jails are privately operated. Regional jails include two or more jail jurisdictions with a formal agreement to operate a jail facility. Persons confined in a jail facility following a criminal conviction are usually sentenced to an incarceration sentence of 1 year or less.\n- Prisons confine persons after they are convicted of a criminal offense and are usually operated under the authority of a state Department of Corrections or the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). As with jails, some prisons are privately operated. Persons confined in a prison are typically serving an incarceration sentence of more than 1 year.\nDoc 5(Title: .) Inflicting suffering through punishment is simply not a path to public safety\nAlternatives to harsh prisons and jails exist.

While many Republican-led states are attempting to pass legislation that tightens voter eligibility rules and makes it harder to register to vote, Democrats are heading efforts in Congress to restore voting rights and make voting easier in federal elections.\nThe division between the two parties on the political stage is no doubt pronounced, but where do everyday Americans stand on the issue of election laws and voting rights?\nIn an effort to gauge how Americans are feeling about various aspects of the country’s politics and society, Penn State’s nonpartisan McCourtney Institute for Democracy regularly conducts the nationally representative Mood of the Nation poll. The April 2021 poll included several questions on election policies. Below are some of the key findings on how Americans feel about who should be allowed to vote and why.\nNearly three-quarters of Americans favor allowing people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their sentences.\nThe strong support for this policy is reflective of the general trend of states restoring the right to vote at some point for people convicted of felonies. Currently, 37 states and the District of Columbia automatically restore voting rights for people convicted of felonies upon completion of sentence, which includes parole or probation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nSupport for allowing those convicted of felonies to vote after serving their time crosses political lines: 89% of Democrats favor the policy, followed by 66% of Independents, and 54% of Republicans. However, among all demographic groups we assessed, Republicans had the lowest percentage of respondents who favored restoring voting rights to those with felony records. Thus it is not surprising that eight of the 11 states that currently do not automatically restore voting rights favored Republican former President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\nAmericans are politically divided on whether people should be removed from registration lists if they have not recently voted or confirmed their registration.\nWhen it comes to the question of removing people from registration lists if they have not recently voted or confirmed their registration, Americans are evenly split: 48% support the idea while 52% are opposed, a difference that is within this survey’s margin of error.\nUnlike the case for restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, support for voter roll purging varies across many of the demographic groups we assessed. The starkest contrast exists between Democrats and Republicans: 80% of Democrats oppose this policy whereas the same proportion of Republicans favor it. Independents are roughly split down the middle on this policy, with 55% responding that they either strongly or somewhat favor removing people from registration lists if they have not recently voted or confirmed their registration.\nMore than 80% of Americans support using a nation-wide database to identify ineligible voters or using administrative records to remove voters who are no longer living.\nAlthough Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided in their views on purging those who have not recently voted or confirmed their voting status, strong majorities from both political affiliations approved of cleaning up voter rolls through either:\nUsing a nation-wide database to identify ineligible voters, or\nUsing administrative records to remove voters who are no longer living\nDoc 2(Title: Mood of the nation: How do Americans feel about who should be allowed to vote?

Many cited widespread voter fraud as a primary concern, while others explained that they just want systems in place to ensure legitimacy.\nAnother theme among this group of respondents is the idea that voting is a privilege, and therefore it is more important for the government to make sure only those eligible can register, even if that makes voting harder and less convenient.\nOn the other side of the argument, respondents who believe the government should make it as easy as possible for eligible citizens to register to vote reasoned that many people already have a difficult time getting to the polls. Efforts to smooth out the voter registration process will therefore lowe\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, there are no explicit age restrictions mentioned for voting in general.

The rich have gotten richer faster than the poor have moved up. And we might be concerned with that because that also reflects on opportunity. And as an opportunity society, as an equal opportunity society, we should all be really concerned with that.) But the extent that we can get away from this notion that the rich are stealing from the poor, then we can look at this in I think in a way that's constructive. Why? Because the rich are our neighbors and the poor are our neighbors, and everybody else should be our neighbors and they're all our kids. And I think getting away from that rhetoric is really important.\nAnd then the last point, actually, as we come to consensus is remembering that capitalism or socialism or social democracy or any system is just a system. Look, it’s just a system. It’s just a machine. It’s like your car. You can do great good with it, you can do great evil with it. It can't go uninhibited. So far it can't drive on its own. It will soon enough. The economy never will be able to.\nCapitalism is nothing more than a system, and it must be predicated on right morals. It must be. Adam Smith taught me that. Adam Smith, the father of modern economics -- he wrote “The Wealth of Nations,” in 1776 -- 17 years before he wrote “The Theory of Moral sentiments,” which was a more important book because it talked about what it meant as a society to earn the right to have free enterprise, to have free economics. And it was true then, and it’s still true today.\nSo this is why this conference is so important. This conversation with the President of the United States is so important, from my point of view -- I say with appropriate humility -- is because we're talking about right morality toward our brothers and sisters, and built on that, that's when we can have an open discussion to get our capitalism right. And then the distribution of resources is only a tertiary question. (Applause.)\nMR. DIONNE: I still want to know how much infrastructure you're actually willing to vote for, but I’ll take --\nMR. BROOKS: $41 billion.\nMR. DIONNE: All right, it’s a start. We can negotiate.\nI want to -- this is in a way for both the President and Bob, because in this conversation about poverty, there’s kind of consensus on this stage that, yes, you need to care about family structure, it really matters, but if you don't worry about the economy, you're not sort of thinking about why the battering ram is against the family.\nAnd yet, this family conversation can make a lot of people feel uneasy because it sounds like either you're not taking politics seriously, or you're not taking the real economic pressure seriously. And I just want to share two things with the President and Bob, and have you respond.\nOne, as you can imagine, I asked a lot of smart people what they would ask about if they were in my position. And one very smart economist said, look, what we know is when we have really tight labor markets, unemployment down below -- down to 4 or even lower -- Kennedy, Johnson years, World War II, at the end of the Clinton years -- all kinds of good things start happening to poor people. So maybe, this person said, even though, he says, yes, family structure matters, let’s stop with the moral lectures and just run a really tight economic policy, and we could have some really good things happen to us.\nAnd then the other thing I wanted to share -- and I’m being pointed here, Mr. President, because you know and I’ve heard you talk about this, but not that often publicly, which is -- you know, I’ve heard you in those sessions you do with opinion reporters -- Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote something back in 2013 about your talk about what needs to happen inside the African American community -- I know you remember this: “Taking full measure of the Obama presidency thus far, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this White House has one way of addressing the social ills that afflict black people and particularly black youth, \nDoc 2(Title: ke their ill-gotten riches. To think less government regulations on corporations are the answer to our woes is beyond naive; It is incredibly dangerous. The banks robbed our economy and the American government bailed them out with $700 billion of taxpayer money. Corporations and governments are in bed together. They are natural allies because their goal is the same: economic and social control. I wish more people would understand this and stop aspiring to be part of the problem. There is nothing noble, respectable, or even fundamentally enjoyable (in the long-term) about hoarding ridiculous wealth accrued by the exploitation of others and the natural world while the rest of the world suffers.) Some ancaps correctly recognize the danger of crony capitalism but they don’t see the danger of plain capitalism, which is strange considering it is corporations that coerce and have coerced governments from their inception to work for them. It is not as if the governments are corrupting the influence of corporations that would otherwise be so moral. Some say in a truly free market system with no government intervention, that the inequality would even out and that bloated, transnational corporations without government subsidies, tax breaks, bail-outs, and other forms of state protectionism would fail. But even if that is true (which it is not for reasons I will explain) why would we not punish or dethrone these economic masters who have collaborated with governments to commit countless crimes against humanity? Why would we just wait for the market to sort it out? If governments are destroyed somehow why should those ill-gotten resources and riches made from government decree, coercion, violence, and exploitation remain the property of billionaires and the powerful 1%? It doesn’t make sense.\nThe reason inequality wouldn’t even out anyway in this scenario is because money is power and as I said every repressive government institution that helps keep corporations in power would be replaced by analogous, private institutions (private police, private armies, etc.) that would keep taking from the poor so the rich could get richer. When people vote with their wallets it is rarely because they have morality in mind. Generally, people buy what is most convenient and inexpensive. Many believe they don’t have the resources to consider the environmental or human impact of every purchase, so consumers reward businesses that use criminal business practices because their prices are lower. In my opinion, crony capitalism is the only kind of capitalism that can exist in the real world because there are already enormous discrepancies in the distribution of wealth and this influences just about every aspect of our lives.. Even in a hypothetical scenario devoid of government wherein everyone started with the exact same amount of money, surely inequality and repressive institutions to maintain it would grow without any efforts to stop it. I often hear from ancaps that “people are not naturally good, which is why we need free markets.” But free markets blindly trust people’s wallets to do the right thing and fail to recognize the negative externalities that catch up to us all. Enslaving a populace might be financially profitable in the short-term but what about the externalities of the people hurt and killed? Even if you only care about money those externalities will come back to you financially as slaves rise up. We can’t keep destroying the Earth and pretending the costs will never catch up to us. The Earth is an interconnected web of living ecosystems. It is not a series of unconnected, separate worlds that don’t affect each other.\nAdam Smith, seen by many as a dogmatic supporter of capitalism, said “under conditions of perfect liberty, markets will lead to perfect equality.” But that is under conditions of perfect liberty, which do not exist when there is an unequal distribution of capital. Smith also wrote the free movement of labor was the basis of any f\nDoc 3(Title: overty is the thing I care about the most.) And in point of fact, 2 billion people around the world have been lifted up out of poverty because of ideas revolving around free enterprise and free trade, and the globalization of ideas of sharing through property rights and rule of law, and all the things that the President is talking about in policy debates right now.\nThat’s why I'm in this particular movement. But we’ve gotten into a partisan moment where we substitute a moral consensus about how we serve the least of these, our brothers and sisters, where we pretend that that moral consensus is impossible,+++++++ and we blow up policy differences until they become a holy war. That’s got to stop because it's completely unnecessary. (Applause.) And we can stop that, absolutely, with a couple of key principles.\nSo how are we on the center right talking about poverty in the most effective way? Number one is with a conceptual matter. We have a grave tendency on both the left and the right to talk about poor people as “the other.” Remember in Matthew 25, these are our brothers and sisters. Jim Olsen and I have this roadshow -- we go to campuses and everybody wants to set up something, right-left debates, and it never works out, because it turns out we both have a commitment to the teachings of the Savior when it comes to treating the least of these, our brothers and sisters.\nWhen you talk about people as your brothers and sisters you don’t talk about them as liabilities to manage. They’re not liabilities to manage. They’re assets to develop because every one of us made in God’s image is an asset to develop. That’s a completely different approach to poverty alleviation. That’s a human capital approach to poverty alleviation. That’s what we can do to stimulate that conversation on the political right, just as it can be on the political left.\nOne concept that rides along with that is to point out -- and this is what I do to many of my friends on Capitol Hill -- I remind them that just because people are on public assistance doesn’t mean they want to be on public assistance. And that’s the difference between people who factually are making a living and who are accepting public assistance. It's an important matter to remember about the motivations of people and humanizing them. And then the question is, how can we come together? How can we come together?\nI have, indeed, written that it's time to declare peace on the safety net. And I say that as a political conservative. Why? Because Ronald Reagan said that; because Friedrich Hayek said that. This is not a radical position. In fact, the social safety net is one of the greatest achievements of free enterprise -- that we could have the wealth and largesse as a society, that we can help take care of people who are poor that we've never even met. It's ahistoric; it's never happened before. We should be proud of that.\nBut then when I talk to conservative policymakers, and say how should you distinguish yourself from the traditional positions in a marketplace of ideas from progressives, you should also talk about the fact that the safety net should be limited to people who are truly indigent, as opposed to being spread around in a way that metastasizes into middle-class entitlements and imperils our economy.\nAnd the third part is that help should always come with the dignifying power of work to the extent that we can. Then we can have, with these three ideas -- declaring peace on the safety net, safety net only for the indigent, and always with work -- then we can have an interesting moral consensus and policy competition of ideas and maybe make some progress.\nMR. DIONNE: Thank you. In fact, I'm hoping people will challenge each other about what that actually means in terms of policy. And I want to invite the President to do that.\nI'm tempted, Mr. President, to ask you to sort of go in a couple of directions at once. One is, I am, again, hoping that you can enlist Arthur as your lobbyist on this\nDoc 4(Title:  that creates a couple of straw men. The stereotype is that you’ve got folks on the left who just want to pour more money into social programs, and don't care anything about culture or parenting or family structures, and that's one stereotype. And then you’ve got cold-hearted, free market, capitalist types who are reading Ayn Rand and -- (laughter) -- think everybody are moochers. And I think the truth is more complicated.) I think that there are those on the conservative spectrum who deeply care about the least of these, deeply care about the poor; exhibit that through their churches, through community groups, through philanthropic efforts, but are suspicious of what government can do. And then there are those on the left who I think are in the trenches every day and see how important parenting is and how important family structures are, and the connective tissue that holds communities together and recognize that that contributes to poverty when those structures fray, but also believe that government and resources can make a difference in creating an environment in which young people can succeed despite great odds.\nAnd it seems to me that if coming out of this conversation we can have a both/and conversation rather than either/or conversation, then we’ll be making some progress.\nAnd the last point I guess I want to make is I also want to emphasize we can do something about these issues. I think it is a mistake for us to suggest that somehow every effort we make has failed and we are powerless to address poverty. That’s just not true. First of all, just in absolute terms, the poverty rate when you take into account tax and transfer programs, has been reduced about 40 percent since 1967.\nNow, that does not lessen our concern about communities where poverty remains chronic. It does suggest, though, that we have been able to lessen poverty when we decide we want to do something about it. In every low-income community around the country, there are programs that work to provide ladders of opportunity to young people; we just haven't figured out how to scale them up.\nAnd so one of the things I’m always concerned about is cynicism. My Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough -- we take walks around the South Lawn, usually when the weather is good, and a lot of it is policy talk, sometimes it’s just talk about values. And one of our favorite sayings is, our job is to guard against cynicism, particularly in this town. And I think it’s important when it comes to dealing with issues of poverty for us to guard against cynicism, and not buy the idea that the poor will always be with us and there’s nothing we can do -- because there’s a lot we can do. The question is do we have the political will, the communal will to do something about it.\nMR. DIONNE: Thank you, Mr. President. I feel as a journalist maybe I’m the one representative of cynicism up here\n-- (laughter) -- so I’ll try to do my job. I want to go through the panel and come back to you, Mr. President. I want to invite Bob, and I’m going to encourage us to reach for solutions. But before we get there, I think it’s important to say that your book, Bob, your book, “Our Kids,” is above all a moral call on the country to think about all the kids in the country who have been left out as our kids, in some deep way. And you make the point that the better off and the poor are now so far apart that the fortunate don’t even see the lives of the unlucky and the left behind. You wrote, “Before I began this research, I was like that.”\nAnd following on what the President said, you insist that the decline in social mobility, the blocking of the American Dream for so many is a purple problem. And I may have some questions later on that, but I really would like you to lay out the red and blue components. And also, how do we break through a politics in which food stamp recipients are still somehow cast as privileged or the poor are demonized. But I’d like you to lay out sort of the moral call of your book.\nMR\nDoc 5(Title: wners talking about their freedom to own people and use them as slaves. Some so-called “freedoms” impinge on other people’s freedoms. The freedom to bomb children, for example, (a “freedom” which is enjoyed by many politicians) is not a good freedom. But when certain people see the word “freedom” or “free” attached to anything, they dogmatically support it without really giving it much thought. The slave owner’s “freedom” to own slaves takes away the slave’s actual freedom. The same is true of capitalism, except the slavery in practice is wage slavery. When the relationship between employer and employee in unethical corporations is usually zero sum, what’s in one’s interest is often against the others. Higher wages for workers means less income for employers and higher income for employers generally means lower wages for workers as the easiest way to make more money is to cut worker’s wages or lay them off.) The myths that the “market will sort out” all the problems of the world and that “capitalism works if you vote with your wallet” have so many inherent problems. Firstly, as mentioned 80% of the world lives on less than $10 a day while the richest 1% own half of the world’s assets. That is hardly one man/woman, one vote, which is the principle the whole idea of voting is contingent upon. Secondly, the former group does not have the resources to “vote” with their wallets i.e. reward the most sustainable, fair-trade, ecologically conscious companies because the capitalist mass producers (the Wal-Marts of the world) use cheap labor and steal resources, undercutting all competition and when you barely have enough money to survive as a poorer person, you’re likely going to buy their products because they’re the cheapest, even when you would rather support the more ethical companies (that generally have more expensive products due to the costs involved in paying workers their fair share and sustainably and ethically acquiring resources). The poorest people end up shopping at companies they detest and that exploit people like them because they have very few options. What’s most profitable is not environmentally conscious or moral. It is the most depraved, iniquitous practices (destroying the Earth, stealing resources, robbing people, forcing people to work) that is most profitable and that’s what capitalism rewards.\nAnarchy doesn’t mean chaos or anything goes. Perfect anarchy can create widespread peace. Anarchy can have rules but only rules that everyone in the voluntarily created commune or group agrees to. In an autonomous or anarchic system, members can govern themselves and police their own communities, instead of electing representatives to “represent them” and having mindless police forces that just want to punish, harm, incarcerate, terrorize, steal, and rule over people. Anarchy is a huge part of the answer, but capitalism is one of the largest problems the world faces. However, “free market” propaganda in the West is so pervasive that many in the “freedom crowd” think it actually has something to do with freedom. “Free markets” don’t mean freedom for common people. They refer to the freedom masters of labor and economies have to exploit and enslave the populace.\nThey have the “freedom” to dig up resources like water from aquifers that should be considered parts of the commons and left alone for the health of the soil. They steal this water from the commons and sell it back to us at $3 a bottle and if you’re dying of dehydration and don’t have a cent, that bottle of water is still the same price and you will go to jail if you try to take it as an individual. What does that have to do with our freedom? Even in a society without government should corporate monopolies continue to exist, they would just replace every oppressive government institution. State and local jails would be replaced by private prisons. State armies would be replaced by private military contractors and mercenaries. Private police would replace state and\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems libertarians believe in minimal government intervention and focus on personal responsibility and free markets to combat income inequality.

Only about a third of Democrats with a negative impression of socialism (34%) say the same.\nConversely, Democrats with a negative impression of socialism are more likely to say that socialism restricts people’s individual’s freedoms.

The top 25 hedge fund managers made more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country.\nSo when I say that, I’m not saying that because I dislike hedge fund managers or I think they’re evil. I’m saying that you’re paying a lower rate than a lot of folks who are making $300,000 a year. You pretty much have more than you’ll ever be able to use and your family will ever be able to use. There’s a fairness issue involved here. And, by the way, if we were able to close that loophole, I can now invest in early childhood education that will make a difference. That’s where the rubber hits the road.\nThat’s, Arthur, where the question of compassion and “I’m my brother’s keeper” comes into play. And if we can’t ask from society’s lottery winners to just make that modest investment, then, really, this conversation is for show. (Applause.)\nAnd by the way, I’m not asking to go back to 70 percent marginal rates, which existed back in the golden days that Bob is talking about when he was a kid. I’m just saying maybe we can go up to like -- tax them like ordinary income, which means that they might have to pay a true rate of around 23, 25 percent which, by historical standards in postwar era, would still be really low.\nSo that’s the kind of issue where if we can’t bridge that gap, then I suspect we’re not going to make as much progress as we need to -- although we can find some areas of agreement like the earned income credit, which I give Arthur a lot of credit for extolling because it encourages work and it could help actually strengthen families.\nMR. DIONNE: Arthur raised capital gains taxes for us here.\nMR. BROOKS: Yes, sure. Fine. These are show issues. Corporate jets are show issues. Carried interest is a show issue. The real issue? Middle-class entitlements -- 70 percent of the federal budget. That’s where the real money is. And the truth of the matter is until we can take that on -- if we want to make progress, if the left and right want to make progress politically as they put together budgets, they’re going to have to make progress on that.\nNow, if we want to create -- if we want to increase taxes on carried interest, I mean, that’s fine for me -- not that I can speak for everybody, certainly not everybody on the Republican side.\nAnd by the way, Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are watching, at least indirectly, and they’re paying attention to this -- 100 percent sure, because they care a lot about this. And they care a lot about both culture and economics, and they care a lot about poverty. And, again, we have to be really careful not to impugn their motives, and impugning motives on the other side is the number-one barrier against making progress. Ad hominem is something we should declare war on and defeat because then we can take on issues on their face, I think.

That is why he saw no need to go into detail about how income or goods would be distributed. In fact, when Marx read a proposed platform for a merger of two German socialist parties, he described phrases like “fair distribution” and “equal right” as “obsolete verbal rubbish.” They belonged, he thought, to an era of scarcity that the revolution would bring to an end.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nThe Soviet Union proved that abolishing private ownership of the means of production does not change human nature. Most humans, instead of devoting themselves to the common good, continue to seek power, privilege, and luxury for themselves and those close to them. Ironically, the clearest demonstration that the springs of private wealth flow more abundantly than those of collective wealth can be seen in the history of the one major country that still proclaims its adherence to Marxism.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nUnder Mao, most Chinese lived in poverty. China’s economy started to grow rapidly only after 1978, when Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping (who had proclaimed that, “It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice”) allowed private enterprises to be established. Deng’s reforms eventually lifted 800 million people out of extreme poverty, but also created a society with greater income inequality than any European country (and much greater than the United States). Although China still proclaims that it is building “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” it is not easy to see what is socialist, let alone Marxist, about its economy.[5](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\n##### Have you read?\n\n*   ##### [It isn't social media that's shielding you from different political views.

Yet his intellectual influence remains. His materialist theory of history has, in an attenuated form, become part of our understanding of the forces that determine the direction of human society. We do not have to believe that, as Marx once incautiously put it, the hand-mill gives us a society with feudal lords, and the steam-mill a society with industrial capitalists. In other writings, Marx suggested a more complex view, in which there is interaction among all aspects of society.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nThe most important takeaway from Marx’s view of history is negative: the evolution of ideas, religions, and political institutions is not independent of the tools we use to satisfy our needs, nor of the economic structures we organize around those tools, and the financial interests they create. If this seems too obvious to need stating, it is because we have internalized this view. In that sense, we are all Marxists now.\n\n</information>\n\n\nSocialists advocate for significant government intervention to redistribute wealth and ensure basic needs are met for all citizens. They propose policies such as raising the minimum wage, expanding labor rights, increasing taxation on the wealthy, and providing public services to reduce income inequality. \n\n<think> Based on the information, libertarians believe in minimal government intervention and allowing free markets to solve income inequality, whereas socialists favor significant government involvement and redistribution of wealth.

Libertarians argue for letting market mechanisms operate freely, which can be more dynamic and responsive to individual initiative.

Garbage. Lock her up. Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean toward either party. Slightly more, 63 percent overall, viewed Trump unfavorably; 62 percent of independents. It’s those independents that Trump’s campaign hopes it can peel off — if it can keep up a steady drumbeat of negativity about Clinton. Three-quarters of voters in the poll said their pick for president is motivated by a desire to cast their ballot against either Clinton or Trump. Still, the criticism has triggered a backlash from some Republicans who say it’s beyond the pale. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who’s skipping the GOP convention, tweeted that Republicans “can make the case that she shouldn’t be elected without jumping the shark.” And Bill Pickle, a South Carolina delegate and talk radio host, said those doing the name-calling “sound and act like demons.” “I personally hate — I mean hate — all of the negativity,” Pickle said. “What happened to professionalism, manners and humanity in our politicians and citizens?” But most Republicans seem unperturbed. Wisconsin delegate Jim Geldreich said the stay-on-offense strategy was spot-on. Clinton, meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage. She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter th) \nDoc 4(Title: DONALD J.

NOTES ON CHANGE IN AMICUS PRACTICE:**\n\n**OR, THE SOFT STATISM OF REDUCING**\n\n**AMICUS BRIEFS TO 8000 WORDS**\n\nFirst off, a quick procedural comment or two:\n\nAmicus notes he has had, “for whatever reason”, a\n\nhiatus of some years since writing the Court. He also\n\nnotes that mysteriously, the rules have changed so\n\nthat the average amicus or amica—one who is not\n\npart of a state entity—is now limited to 8000 words,\n\ninstead of the 9000 he/she used to have. Amicus\n\nwonders if this new rationing of core legal and/or\n\npolitical (since law and politics overlap) speech is a\n\ngood idea.\n\n_Inter alia_, state entities, being large, established,\n\nand powerful, have plenty of ways of making\n\nthemselves heard. By contrast, it is, say, the small-\n\ntime country lawyer, writing her first and only brief\n\nto this Court, who may need all 9000 words to make\n\nimportant and complicated arguments to the Court.\n\nMaybe the government amici, not the “little people”,\n\nso to speak, should have been restricted to 8000\n\nwords, Thus, there is arguably a sort of statism, even\n\nif soft statism, in the new 8000-word wall. Perhaps\n\nthe Court can revisit its unnecessary speech-\n\nrationing at some point.\n\n5\n\n(Amicus is not “resentful” of the 8000-word limit;\n\nif he were, then, like Achilles sulking in his tent,\n\nHomer, _The Iliad_, he might have refused even to\n\nwrite this brief, or any amicus brief. But sulking\n\nmay achieve little, so here is Amicus, with his brief.)\n\n…True, some amici may be able to shoehorn their\n\nentire brief into, say, the length of a 17-syllable\n\n_haiku_. This is not always going to happen, though.\n\nEnough on that point for now: speaking of\n\nstatism, far more important forms of statism exist to\n\nbe criticized here, such as the deep state of\n\ncorruption created at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if\n\nthe President is deemed immune to criminal\n\nproceedings during his tenure in office.\n\n**II.

Whether\n\nthis umbrageous gang exists or not, what would be\n\neven worse, maybe, is if in open view, one member of\n\nour society is made into a temporary god, or idol, free\n\nfrom criminal investigation or prosecution. Such a\n\nparagon of lawlessness, a perfidious President\n\nbeyond his own society’s limitations, a Nietzschean\n\n“Superman” of sorts—“beyond good and evil”, at\n\nleast in his own troubled mind—, would be a one-\n\nperson “Deep State” incarnate: dark, untouchable,\n\nun-America\nDoc 5(Title: freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women ...

Retrieve\nDoc 3(Title: Second impeachment of Donald Trump) Donald Trump, serving as the 45th president of the United States, was impeached for the second time on January 13, 2021, one week before his term expired. On that date, the House of Representatives adopted one article of impeachment against Trump: incitement of insurrection. On February 13, 2021, the Senate voted to acquit Trump on the article of impeachment.\nThe House of Representatives of the 117th U.S. Congress adopted one article of impeachment against Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\", stating that he had incited the January 6 attack of the U.S. Capitol. The House impeachment managers formally triggered the start of the impeachment trial on January 25 by delivering to the Senate the charge against Trump.[1] The trial in the Senate started on February 9.[2] At the trial in the Senate, 57 senators voted \"guilty\", which was less than the two-thirds majority needed (67) to convict Trump, and 43 senators voted \"not guilty\", resulting in Trump being acquitted of the charges on February 13, 2021.[3]\nThe trial was the first of its kind for a departed U.S. president: all other impeachment trials of presidents (those of Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Trump) occurred during their presidencies. Many Republican senators challenged the validity of holding an impeachment trial for a president no longer in office; proponents cited the Senate's 1876 trial of William W. Belknap, the secretary of war under President Ulysses S. Grant, who was impeached, but not convicted, after resigning from office immediately before a House vote on his impeachment.[4]\nThis impeachment was the fourth impeachment of a U.S. president, and the second of Trump; his first impeachment was in December 2019.[5][6]\nIn August 2023, Trump was twice indicted for the conduct at issue in his impeachment, once in Georgia and once federally. The federal charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2024, due to the DOJ's policy of not prosecuting sitting presidents, subsequent to Trump's re-election that month.[7]\nBackground\nAttempts to overturn the 2020 election\nFor weeks prior to the impeachment, President Trump made numerous unsuccessful attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election.\nJanuary 6 U.S. Capitol attack\nTrump told his supporters to come to Washington, D.C. on January 6, the day Congress was counting the electoral votes, to the \"March to Save America\" rally at The Ellipse.[8] During the rally, Trump as well as other speakers falsely claimed that the election was stolen, used the word \"fight\", made an analogy to boxing,[9] and suggested that his supporters had the power to prevent President-elect Joe Biden from taking office.[10]\nWhen the United States Congress convened to certify the electoral votes of the presidential election, supporters of Trump crossed the Mall and stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to prevent the tabulation of votes and protest against Biden's win. Trump supporters illegally entered the Capitol and gathered on its eastern and western sides, including on the inaugural platform constructed for Biden's inauguration.[11] Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died from the riots, while several improvised explosive devices were found on and near the Capitol grounds.[12][13] Another Capitol police officer on duty during the riots died by suicide days later.[14] During the riots, Trump was \"initially pleased\" by the attack on the Capitol and took no action.[15][16] In a speech hours into the event, Trump told the rioters \"We love you. You're very special,\" restated his false claims of electoral fraud, and then asked them to go home.[17] Hours later, Congress reconvened and ultimately certified the electoral votes in the early morning hours of January 7. Trump then released a statement asserting that there would be an \"orderly transition\" of power on Inauguration Day, even while continuing to claim falsely that the election was stolen from him and also stat\nDoc 4(Title: le\" and saying that the President had \"crossed a constitutional line that Mr. Trump hasn't previously crossed\".[151]) Other organizations\nThe Lincoln Project, a political action committee formed by anti-Trump Republicans and former Republicans, called for the House of Representatives and the Senate to \"immediately impeach Donald Trump for directing and provoking this attack\".[152]\nThe National Association of Manufacturers also requested Pence to \"seriously consider\" invoking the 25th Amendment.[153]\nFreedom House issued a press release calling for the immediate removal of President Trump, through resignation, the 25th Amendment, or impeachment.[154]\nThe American Civil Liberties Union called for Trump's impeachment for the second time.[155]\nMarch for Science circulated an online petition calling for Trump to be removed immediately via the 25th Amendment.[156]\nCrowell & Moring LLP, a large Washington, D.C., law firm, circulated a letter among the nation's largest law firms calling for Trump's removal under Section 4 of the Constitution's 25th Amendment. At least 18 other law firms, including DLA Piper, Foley Hoag, and Hanson Bridgett joined this call.[157][158]\nOpposition\nSenators\nOn January 7, Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) said \"These calls for impeachment I'm hearing -- I don't think they're helpful, and I think we should allow 13 days to move forward peacefully and prepare for this transition of power that's going to happen on Jan. 20.\"[159]\nOn January 8, Senator Lindsey Graham (R–SC) tweeted that impeachment \"will do more harm than good\".[160] In a follow-up tweet, he implied[how?] that Pelosi and Schumer wanted to impeach Trump because they were concerned about their own political survival.[161] Also, on January 11, Graham tweeted \"It is past time for all of us to try to heal our country and move forward. Impeachment would be a major step backward.\"[162]\nOn January 11, three senators spoke out against impeachment. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) said \"Let's get through the 10 days. He will leave the office and let's get on with things.\"[163] Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) said \"We need to work together to heal the divisions in our nation and impeachment would instead serve to further divide our country.\"[164] Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) said \"I'm not going to do what the Democrats are doing. I think we need to lower the rhetoric. We need to get some unity going.\"[165]\nOn January 12, Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) tweeted \"An impeachment vote will only lead to more hate and a deeply fractured nation. I oppose impeaching President Trump.\"[166]\nOn January 13, seven senators spoke out against impeachment. Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) said \"At a time when the United States needs national healing and a true commitment to the rule of law, the American people should look to their legislators not to deepen partisan division, but to bring us together. There are seven days to go in the President's term, and he has fully committed to a peaceful transfer of power.\"[167] Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said \"Moving forward with impeachment at this juncture will only further divide our already hurting nation.\"[168] Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said: \"The president's rhetoric, while reckless, while at some level could be accused of inciting anger and inciting some bad behavior, it is also clear that the exact words that he used do not rise to, in my mind anyway, a criminal level of incitement as we would have to consider, in my view, in this process even as political as it is.\"[169] Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) said \"To persist with impeachment now, with just days to go in the current administration, will further divide Americans and exacerbate tensions. Moving forward, it is my sincere hope Congress will work on a bipartisan basis to restore the confidence of the American people in our elections and affirm our shared commitment to the rule of law.\"[170] Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) told the Meridian Star on January 13 that he opposes impeachment.[171] Sen\nDoc 5(Title: By — Josh Lederman, Associated Press Josh Lederman, Associated Press By — Erica Werner, Associated Press Erica Werner, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-republicans Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Why some Republicans in Cleveland want Hillary Clinton in prison Politics Jul 20, 2016 4:59 PM EST CLEVELAND — Liar. Garbage. Lock her up. Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean toward either party. Slightly more, 63 percent overall, viewed Trump unfavorably; 62 percent of independents. It’s those independents that Trump’s campaign hopes it can peel off — if it can keep up a steady drumbeat of negativity about Clinton. Three-quarters of voters in the poll said their pick for president is motivated by a desire to cast their ballot against either Clinton or Trump. Still, the criticism has triggered a backlash from some Republicans who say it’s beyond the pale. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who’s skipping the GOP convention, tweeted that Republicans “can make the case that she shouldn’t be elected without jumping the shark.” And Bill Pickle, a South Carolina delegate and talk radio host, said those doing the name-calling “sound and act like demons.” “I personally hate — I mean hate — all of the negativity,” Pickle said. “What happened to professionalism, manners and humanity in our politicians and citizens?” But most Republicans seem unperturbed. Wisconsin delegate Jim Geldreich said the stay-on-offense strategy was spot-on. Clinton, meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage. She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter th) \n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that Donald Trump hasn't been ejected from the Republican party due to ongoing internal discussions and debates about the necessity of removing him versus focusing on a peaceful transition. </think>\nassistant <answer> ongoing internal discussions and debates </answer>\n\nIt appears the decision to eject Donald Trump from the Republican party involves complex considerations and internal disagreements within the party, which has not led to an official ejection despite calls for it.",

Spent coffee grounds can be used as a soil amendment and compost ingredient, while liquid coffee acts as an effective slug killer.) According to various sources, between 400 billion to 1 trillion cups of coffee are consumed around the world every year. No matter the number, that’s a lot of coffee, which means a lot of spent coffee grounds. Using coffee grounds in the garden keeps them out of the waste stream and gives gardeners another option for caring for plants and dealing with slugs.\nLinda Brewer, Oregon State University Extension Service soil scientist, said coffee grounds can be worked into the soil or added to a compost pile but should be done with some restraint.\n“The big message is that generally people are too enthusiastic,” Brewer said. “You really need to take the recommended dosages to heart. I’ve visited a site where a raised bed was ruined by too much coffee grounds. Like most kitchen waste, it is a fine amendment for the garden, but like anything else, coffee grounds can be overdone.”\nContrary to popular belief, it’s a myth that coffee grounds are acidic and will lower the pH of the soil. After brewing, the grounds are close to pH neutral, between 6.5 and 6.8. Research shows that whatever change coffee grounds bring to the soil is short-lived, Brewer said. So, don’t depend on them to keep a lower soil pH. Some plants like rhododendrons, azaleas, blueberries, gardenias and blue-flowering hydrangeas require a lower soil pH to thrive and coffee grounds won’t do that.\nFor more information about pH, see Extension publications “Acidifying Soil in Landscapes and Gardens East of the Cascades” and “Acidifying Soil for Blueberries and Ornamental Plants in Yard and Garden: West of the Cascade Mountain Range in Oregon and Washington.”\nAlthough coffee grounds provide some nitrogen (1% to 2%) and micronutrients, they aren’t a major source of plant nutrition, Brewer said. As coffee grounds break down, nitrogen is tied up by soil microorganisms using it to grow and reproduce. To adjust, add a nitrogen fertilizer or other source of nitrogen like composted animal manure, alfalfa meal or grass clippings when the uncomposted coffee grounds are incorporated.\nEven though coffee grounds provide minor amounts of potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium and very minor amounts of iron, copper, manganese and zinc, these nutrients aren’t supplied in sufficient quantity to satisfy plant needs. Coffee grounds are best at improving soil. As the coffee grounds feed the soil microbes, microbial glues are released that promote good soil structure and improve drainage.\nWhen using coffee grounds as a soil amendment, Brewer recommends working in a half inch to a depth of 4 inches. If used as a mulch on top of the soil, a layer of leaves or bark mulch helps keep the grounds from drying out and repelling water.\nWhen using grounds in the compost bin or pile, layer 3-parts leaves to 1-part fresh grass clippings to 1-part coffee grounds by volume. Coffee filters can be thrown in, too. Turn once a week and monitor for moisture and the compost will be ready in three to six months. The composition of the compost pile should not exceed 20% coffee grounds by volume, or it can be toxic to plants.\nExcess coffee grounds, if applied to the soil before composting, have multiple effects on the soil system. In addition to microorganisms tying up nitrogen temporarily, the caffeine residues in the spent coffee grounds can suppress germination and slow the growth of some plants.\nIf you get coffee grounds from coffee shops, you can store them tightly covered until ready for use. Mold may grow on the grounds, but these can be composted, where the mold will contribute to decomposition.\nPerhaps more exciting than the positive effect of coffee grounds as a compost and soil amendment, is its potential as a slug killer, Brewer said.

Numbers of slugs and snails have increased in broadacre cropping in Western Australia (WA) with the use of minimum tillage and stubble-retention practices. These systems increase the organic content of paddocks and soil moisture content, leading to higher survival levels of slugs and snails.\nSlug and snail pests in Australia have come from other countries, mainly in the Mediterranean region. They have similar lifecycles, which means similar management techniques can be employed to control them in broadacre crops.\nEffective management requires application of controls that coincide with different phases of the pest’s lifecycle. Each of the control measures outlined in this factsheet, if applied only by themselves, are unlikely to provide optimum control. An integrated approach needs to be considered to protect crops from damage by slugs and/or snails.\nNumber of Pages\n11\nKeywords\npest slugs, snails, broadacre crops, Western Australia, pest management\nDisciplines\nAgricultural Education | Biosecurity | Entomology\nRecommended Citation\nDepartment of Primary Industries and Regional Development, Western Australia.\n(2024), Pest slugs and snails and their management in broadacre crops.

That’s a lot of grounds that might otherwise end up in the waste stream. Using coffee grounds in the garden keeps them out of landfills and gives gardeners another option for improving soil and controlling pests.\nLinda Brewer, a soil scientist with the Oregon State University Extension Service, said coffee grounds can be valuable for gardens and compost piles — if used in moderation.\n“The big message is that generally people are too enthusiastic,” Brewer said. “You really need to take the recommended dosages to heart. I’ve seen raised beds ruined by too much coffee. Like most kitchen waste, it’s a fine amendment, but coffee grounds can be overdone.”\nMyths about acidity\nIt’s a common misconception that coffee grounds are acidic. After brewing, they’re close to neutral — around pH 6.5 to 6.8. Any pH change in the soil is temporary, Brewer said.\nThat means coffee grounds won’t lower soil pH enough to benefit acid-loving plants such as rhododendrons, azaleas, blueberries, gardenias and blue-flowering hydrangeas.\nFor more on soil acidity, visit Acidifying soil in landscapes and gardens east of the Cascades and Acidifying soil for blueberries and ornamental plants in yard and garden: West of the Cascade Mountain Range in Oregon and Washington.\nCoffee grounds add structure, not major nutrients\nAlthough coffee grounds contain 1% to 2% nitrogen and small amounts of micronutrients, they aren’t a major source of plant nutrition. As the grounds break down, soil microorganisms temporarily tie up nitrogen while they grow and reproduce. To balance this, add a nitrogen-rich source such as composted manure, alfalfa meal or grass clippings when incorporating fresh coffee grounds.\nCoffee grounds contribute small amounts of potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium, and trace amounts of iron, copper, manganese and zinc. However, these aren’t sufficient to meet plant needs. The main benefit comes from improving soil structure and drainage. As soil microbes feed on the grounds, they release compounds that bind soil particles into stable, well-draining aggregates.\nHow to use coffee grounds in soil and compost\nWhen using coffee grounds as a soil amendment, Brewer recommends working in a half inch of grounds to a depth of 4 inches. If using as mulch, cover with leaves or bark mulch to prevent the surface from drying and repelling water.\nIn a compost pile, mix three parts leaves to one part fresh grass clippings to one part coffee grounds by volume. Coffee filters can be composted as well. Turn the pile weekly and monitor for moisture. The compost should be ready in three to six months. Coffee grounds should make up no more than 20% of the pile’s total volume — higher amounts can be toxic to plants.\nIf applied directly to soil before composting, excess coffee grounds can temporarily tie up nitrogen and may inhibit seed germination or slow plant growth due to caffeine residues.\nIf you collect grounds from coffee shops, store them in a sealed container until use. Mold may develop, but it’s harmless in compost and contributes to decomposition.\nCoffee as a natural slug control\nCoffee can also deter or kill slugs and snails. Brewer said research shows that a 1% to 2% caffeine solution used as a soil drench caused all slugs to leave treated soil and die of caffeine poisoning. A 2% solution applied to orchid growing media killed 95% of snails — outperforming a common slug bait containing metaldehyde.\nTo make a 1% to 2% soil drench, mix one part water with two parts strong brewed coffee.

After that incident I wasn’t even taken to hospital for a check-up. It’s still unknown what mental damage that (evidently) caused me. Before finishing primary school I was kicked so hard in the testicles by a much older and stronger girl that one of them failed to develop and drop properly, probably stunting my growth and causing unknown developmental issues. They did no follow-up with the school, …didn’t seem to care. They were invasive of my privacy and once the mother openly confronted me about some drawings I did which I hid under my bed and a stupid ‘journal’ thing I kept as pure fantasy, the kind of release a child needs developmentally, nothing but pure fantasy and expression. She exclaimed how it was ‘offensive’ to her. Not seeing how she was over-stepping a boundary and widening the tentative gap of trust between us. I still to this day have no idea what she did with those. I’m pretty sure she gave them to someone to ‘analyze’ or even handed them in to the police or something. As I grew up and went off to college, I’d return home to find my wardrobes empty, the mother would routinely go through my clothing and remove it to give to charity. Then think nothing of it even deny she touched anything. I used to struggle in school (Surprise, surprise… Unchecked head-trauma and absolutely no support or guidance at home…?) And once a Right-wing nutcase teacher gave me the lowest-possible mark out of spite purely because she had opposing political views to my Councilor father. Again, they did nothing about it. I was raped as a very young, vulnerable teen (Possibly just turned 17) on 2 separate occasions by 2 different abusive over-weight women. I couldn’t open up about that at home, I had no support network or love there. With no coping mechanisms and no known-strategies, I had to push it down, try to move-on and cope myself. When I passed my driving test the father had the audacity to say to my instructor (in-front of my face) that, “Well, I know you have to let a certain percentage pass” ..Yeah. No, “Congratulations” for me. When I was harassed constantly by a newly-arrived CID inspector all over the town I was growing up in, the parents turned a blind-eye. Didn’t want to know. I was bullied to 2 older kids in school, every chance they got to mess with me they did, eventually I was assaulted by one, when I went home with a sore eye-socket the mother screamed at ‘me’ for it. Not the reaction you would expect from a ‘loving parent’ I know families who would go out of their way to spill blood over something like protecting their children. But, oh well. Then I had to get the hell out of that toxic home. I began failing at life, I struggled with many addictions, primarily alcohol problems. There was no love or concern about that. I started to go off the rails, admittedly. But what chance did I have? Looking back I just can’t blame myself for the trouble I fell into. I was unloved, raised in an un-loving home environment. Taught absolutely nothing and never given any guidance to help me through life to speak of. …Yea, I hate my parents.

But it was like a kind of fashion ,because as far as I know every house hold had at least one or even two Martinets to whip all the girls and boys even teenagers ,Because you could be whipped because like mine were very long one’s and buttoned in the back with big and large plastic buttons in this manner ,so you could’nt getnthem off and as we were so ashamed We dared asking somebody to unbutton your buttons to get it off!

So automaticly all 3 of us we had to wear again our nylon overalls,at that time our mother had bought all 3 of us each a long navy blue nylon overall buttoned in the back with none less than 10 big plastic buttons too!+ even I was 16 years old and my 2 sisters 13 and 8 years old we also wore short pants with large pant suspenders wich were always pulled up high by our mother,at such an extent that we could’nt even bend down properly!or go to the toilettes alone at school with all of nylon overalls buttoned in the back + our large elastic pant suspenders,but that’s the way our mother wanted to see us + it was very easy to whip our buttocks with the Martinet aswell ,because all she had to do is just lift up our nylon buttoned overalls!suspenders too,!When I did \nDoc 3(Title: chool with all of nylon overalls buttoned in the back + our large elastic pant suspenders,but that’s the way our mother wanted to see us + it was very easy to whip our buttocks with the Martinet aswell ,because all she had to do is just lift up our nylon buttoned overalls!suspenders too,!When I did have to go to toilet like my sisters ,we had to ask a teacher to Undo everything ,and put it back again ,wich did ‘nt bother them too much,on the contrary they liked it ,and me at the age of 16 still being dressed like a little boy ,it did embarrass me,but that’s the way it was! and all the French mothers were the same ,because thetyput allot of this stuff on their boys and girls and once again if ever you complained you got whipped instantly by your mothers who were all like us in their very long and very large nylon buttoned overalls too,and without saying anything bad some mothers were really tall and fat and with their nylon overalls they looked huge and Impressive,in those days there was no Regime, or Diet!and you ass whiipings you felt them beleive me!,and one day in the middle of the school playground there was an oak tree and betwenn boys we boasted wich one couls reach the top of it!,Oh sure imanaged it ,but came down in a terrible state ,espcially that I could not have any free mouvement with my legs ,because of all those big overall plastic button were Imprisoning my legs ,but I managed to get to the top!

AS\nJanuary 23rd, 2023 at 3:35 PMReading these comments brings a level of relief. I don’t just hate one parent, I hate both. My parents physically, emotionally, and mentally abused me as far back as I can remember. I was four years old when I my dad gave me my first black eye. I remember the day clearly; my parents were having family over, and they didn’t want anyone to see my black eye. They had me stay in my room and pretend to be sick. They even trained me to lie about it. I went to the dentist and I remember her asking me what happened. Right on cue, like a trained puppy, I said I walked into a door. I used to think it was my fault and thought this was normal. It isn’t normal and it wasn’t my fault. I am a mom now, and my daughter was once four years old. I have never laid a hand on her. Try imagining what awful thing a four year old can do that deserved that. I can’t and never will. The beatings continued over the years. My brother and I got horrifically and inhumanely beat. I was put in a foster home by child protective services in second grade, as my cousin filed a complaint, since my mom decided it was okay to slap her too. Even after we were reunited with our family, they never stopped. I grew up sad, lonely, miserable, had zero friends, was bullied at school, and had no identity. I am shocked no one at my schools saw this over the years. My dad used to hit my mom, too. My mom never stood up for herself or her children. She would hit me, pull my hair, call me names (kuti in Hindi. means female dog; thought that was my middle name growing up), and would tell me wait till your dad comes home. I was always scared of my dad. He used to call me fat as a child and force me to run at the park, even pushing me from behind. If I spilt a glass of milk, my mom hit me. If I missed a corner while dusting, my dad beat me. Never correct me, showed me the correct way to do, just swiftly moved to punishing. Fists, belts, wooden spoons, 2×4, you name it, it was a weapon. My dad once choked me with a rope and all my mom could say “you are gonna kill her.” Didn’t stop him. To teach me a lesson to never\nDoc 4(Title: always wondered why she did that. But she is also lonely, no friends. And it all really makes sense now!) My father is the classical home-terrorist, who would yell and shout for misplacing shoes or leaving homework at the table. I remember him as always yelling, always angry, always telling us we weren’t good enough, smart enough ect. He still does this. My mother would to protect herself, by just shutting down mentally, and not react to all the name calling and mental abuse, unable to give any love but the superficial.\nI hit a rough patch a couple of years ago, feeling myself getting more and more depressed. I tried talking to my mother about it, and she couldn’t handle it and just told me that I must be bored and suggested that I read a book… It was really tough, having to realise that when I needed my parents the most, they weren’t able to and wouldn’t help me at all.\nI have really had trouble accepting that I don’t like my parents. I try to protect myself, by not visiting them, not answering the phone and not seeing them except when I absolutely have to (birthdays and such). And your article made that okay.

I hate to say it but am glad my father is dead after watching him beat our sister and brother and stepping in and trying to stop it and we get more of the beatings just was bad . he would call us names that you could never under stand as to why . dad always said it was because it was the way he was raised and left it as that .. Mom always said because her dad was a moonshine runner and a drinker and a drunk . I always ask them but why us and got the same anwsers . Now that i have 1 kid that i love with all my heart i have never as i told my self from childhood i will never in my life touch my kid or kids and she has never been hit or touched in her life .

Never correct me, showed me the correct way to do, just swiftly moved to punishing. Fists, belts, wooden spoons, 2×4, you name it, it was a weapon. My dad once choked me with a rope and all my mom could say “you are gonna kill her.” Didn’t stop him. To teach me a lesson to never lie again. I lied cause I was afraid of them. I have to tell you even when I got my period, my mom didn’t give me any privacy and asked me to lay down and she wiped my crotch for me. I was flipping 12 years old! I had no clue what a period was. In the Indian community, puberty and body changes aren’t discussed in healthy manner. You are shamed and embarrassed for changes you have no control over. I had no autonomy over my own body. My parents would tell me I was ungrateful, since they went to work all day, and I was not good enough. I have so many memories of being hit. Now, I am 45 years old. I am a mom and adore my daughter and I have never laid a hand on her. I broke the intergenerational trauma. My daughter now has a head start in life. A healthy, normal one. I was supposed to have an arranged marriage; after watching my dad hit my mom over the years, and I saw it in other marriages in my family as well. I went no way. The one thing I did right, was standing my ground, and refusing to marry whom they wanted me to marry. I married for love. I am happily married to the love of my life. He dotes on me and our daughter. He has never laid a hand on me or our daughter.) My mom died and now my dad is trying to guilt me into moving closer to him, to help take care of him. My brother went onto to become a meth addict and live a horrible life. He has my dad to thank for his addiction. One of the things my brother said to me in a psychosis was “do you know what it feels like to be in fourth grade, and your legs are trembling as you are walking home, cause you know you will get a beating for getting a low grade on your report card.” That came from a man who was 28 years old at that time. Fear destroys your soul. Now, my dad is saying garbage like “I fed you, clothed you, took you to school, etc.” My answer to that? Your kids don’t owe you for doing what parents are supposed to do. They are not indebted to you no matter the indoctrination you subject them to as children. Don’t have children if you are expecting a payout. Its funny to me; the man who never once hugged his children, said he loved them or showed them any affection, now wants love in his elderly years. To bad for him, I don’t know how to give it to him. Nor do I want to. I hope he dies a lonely man. I used to mourn my mom and didn’t know why. I now understand I clung to the one parent who showed me some kind of affection even if it was barely there. Children look for attachment to their caregivers, even if it an abusive one.\nI wish I could go back and have a re-do. Be a happy kid. But you learn the hard way, there are no re-dos. What matters now, is my daughter is free of the intergenerational abuse and trauma. That makes my heart soar.\nKibet\nApril 24th, 2023 at 4:21 AMWhy do you bear children that you know they are going to suffer,,,,why bear children to go through the pain that you went through,,,,why do parents make their children suffer he rest if their life,,,,and this is what i went through my parents have never loved never loved me ,,,and one of the painful moments that made me hate myself is that i finished my high school and i was supposed to go to university,,but my parents were so ignorant even my older brothers and sisters were not even bothered to take me to university,,,most of the time they say that even business is good ,,,,,,i can’t tell everything ,,, because my family members are so favoured alot ,,i really hate my parents alot especially my father who has been belittling me since as a young boy,,\nbajrang\nJuly 15th, 2023 at 8:49 AMi hate my parents because they bully me\nLeave a Comment\nBy commenting you acknowledge acceptance of GoodTherapy.org's Terms and Con\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, a mother insisting on watching her child dress and making comments about the child's body can be considered sexual abuse.

These compromises also happen in everyday life, from seatbelt laws to food-safety regulations. A paper published in [_Perspectives on Psychological Science_](https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916211034499), however, suggests that restricting freedoms may have other unintended negative consequences for behavior and health. One of the authors, Nathan Cheek with Princeton University, explains how there may be a balance that can be achieved and how psychological science could help policymakers [promote public health](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/hero-epidemics-rt), safety, and well-being in times of crisis.\n\n_Auto-generated transcript_\n\n##### Charles Blue (00:12)\n\nThere is an often misstated and misunderstood quote by Benjamin Franklin, which reads, “Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither Liberty nor safety. Though often used rhetorically to denounce impositions or laws restricting certain behaviors, Franklin was actually referring to a specific tax dispute. This quote is therefore more accurately a pro-taxation and pro-defense spending statement than a quote supporting the absolute preservation of freedoms. During the Pandemic and other natural disasters, many actions are taken by governments to save lives at the cost of certain liberties. This is even in everyday life, from seatbelt laws to food safety regulations. The worthy objective of these restrictions is to protect people by imposing limits on what they are free to do. A new article published in _Perspectives on Psychological Science_, however, suggests there may be unintended consequences. Restricting freedoms may have negative consequences for behavior and health. This paper suggests that there is a balance that can be achieved and that psychology can help policymakers promote public health, safety, and well being when crises and disasters strike.

Thank you for joining me today.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (01:40)\n\nThanks so much for having me.

So my co-authors and I started having conversations about the many changes we were seeing in the wake of the Pandemic. So in the first few months, we saw dramatic world changes, extreme public policies that for many of us were relatively unprecedented, whether it was in the form of restrictions, social distancing requirements, work from home mandates, and many other things. And as these were unfolding, we were wondering what the psychological consequences would be of these dramatic changes. And then some early data coming out of Italy suggested that the psychology of freedom needed to be taken more seriously. And in fact, in a nationally representative sample of Italians, the most frequently reported new negative consequence of the lockdown was restricted freedom, even above things like financial burdens and social isolation. So clearly we need to be taking freedom seriously. As we were doing this work, we found that there were two broad clusters of negative consequences that seem to emerge when people face these kinds of new restrictions. The first is a cluster of mental and physical health consequences. It hurts to have freedom taken away, sometimes quite literally. And the second cluster was around negative behavioral responses ranging from things like noncompliance to more extreme manifestations of reactants in the form of, for example, public protest.\n\n##### Charles Blue (03:08)\n\nYour paper implies that there may be an imp\nDoc 2(Title: of those in power, than by violent and sudden usurpation.\" James Madison) - \"Every successful revolution puts on in time the robe of the tyrant it has deposed.\" Barbara Tuchman\n- \"Liberty, too, must be limited in order to be possessed.\" Edmund Burke\n- \"The great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves under Government, is the preservation of property [i.e., life, liberty, and estate].\" John Locke\n- \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause...\" Fourth Amendment\n- Which, if any, of these statements do you find most persuasive?

A recent poll indicated that a substantial percentage of American citizens would be willing to give up some protections of the Bill of Rights in order to control illegal drug use.\nSeveral years ago Congress passed a law authorizing federal authorities to confiscate the property of individuals suspected of trafficking in drugs. Such property could be seized on mere suspicion. Individuals whose property had been seized could appeal and seek a return of their property, but the burden of proof rested on them to prove their innocence.\nAdvocates of this law argued its constitutionality on the grounds that the government was not acting against the suspected individuals, only against their property. Since only individuals, and not property, enjoy the protection of the Bill of Rights, they said, the law did not violate the Constitution.\nSince going into effect the law has proved controversial. Congress may repeal it. Do you think it should be repealed? Even if the constitutionality of such a law is upheld, should the government have such power? How would you determine the circumstances in which protections guaranteed by the Constitution should be curtailed by the government?\n- How do the following statements apply to this situation?

Diversity\nIs a common language essential to the survival of American democracy? One of the most controversial aspects of diversity in America has to do with language. Throughout our history English has been the principal language of the country. For millions of immigrants, learning English was an important first step to becoming a U.S. citizen.\nSchools must teach immigrant children who speak languages other than English. Educators differ about how best to accomplish their tasks. Moreover, a large percentage of recent immigrants use Spanish as their first language. In certain areas of the country Spanish is as commonly spoken as English. We are becoming, many believe, a bilingual nation.\n- How do the following statements apply to this situation? What\nDoc 3(Title: re talking to a Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, \"We don't know how lucky we are.\" And the Cuban stopped and said, \"How lucky you are? I had someplace to escape to.\" And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.) And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man.\nThis is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down - [up] man's old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.\nIn this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the \"Great Society,\" or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say, \"The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism.\" Another voice says, \"The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state.\" Or, \"Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century.\" Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as \"our moral teacher and our leader,\" and he says he is \"hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document.\" He must \"be freed,\" so that he \"can do for us\" what he knows \"is best.\" And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as \"meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government.\"\nWell, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as \"the masses.\" This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, \"the full power of centralized government\"this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.\nNow, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85 percent of the farm surplus. Three-fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21 percent increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce. You see, that one-fourth of farming that's regulated and controlled by the federal government. In the last three years we've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow.\nSenator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater, as Presid\nDoc 4(Title:  a neutral arbiter, phrased in a resonant populism:\"It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes. Distinctions in society will always exist under every just government. Equality of talents, of education, or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions. In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics, and laborers--who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government. There are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses. If it would confine itself to equal protection, and, as Heaven does its rains, shower its favors alike on the high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be an unqualified blessing.\") Though some original Jackson men were flabbergasted and outraged at his turn against the Bank, the veto held up in Congress. It became the prime issue in the ensuing presidential campaign, with both sides distributing copies of Jackson's message. Jackson read his re-election as a mandate to pursue his attack on the Bank further.\nRemoval of the Deposits\nAs soon as the nullification crisis was resolved, Jackson took his next step. The Bank's open involvement in the presidential campaign convinced him more than ever of its inherent corruption. To draw its fangs until its charter ran out in 1836, he determined to withdraw the federal government's own deposits from the Bank and place them in selected state-chartered banks.\nThis was a maneuver requiring some delicacy. Under the charter, the secretary of the treasury, not the President, had authority to remove the deposits. He had also to explain his reasons to Congress, where the House of Representatives had just voted by a two-to-one margin that the deposits should stay where they were. Jackson canvassed his cabinet on removal. Most of them opposed it, but he got the support and arguments he needed from Attorney General Roger Taney. Jackson drew up a paper explaining his decision, read it to the cabinet, and ordered Treasury Secretary William John Duane to execute the removal. To Jackson's astonishment, Duane refused. He also refused to resign, so Jackson fired him and put Taney in his place. Taney ordered the removal, which was largely complete by the time Congress convened in December 1833.\nEven many congressional foes of the Bank could not countenance Jackson's proceedings against it. He had defied Congress's intent, rode roughshod over the treasury secretary's statutory control over the public purse, and removed the public funds from the lawfully authorized, responsible hands of the Bank of the United States to an untried, unregulated, and perhaps wholly irresponsible collection of state banks. To many, Jackson seemed to regard himself as above the law.\nFortunately for Jackson, Bank president Nicholas Biddle over-reacted and played into his hands. Regarding the removal of deposits as a declaration of open war, Biddle determined to force a recharter by creating a financial panic. Loss of the deposits required some curtailment of the Bank's loans, but Biddle carried the contraction further than was necessary in a deliberate effort to squeeze businessmen into demanding a recharter. This manipulation of credit for political ends served only to discredit the Bank and to vindicate Jackson's strictures against it.\nCongress did not even consider recharter, but it did lash out at Jackson. Clay men and Southern anti-tariffites could not agree on the American System; they could not all agree on rechartering the Bank; but they could unite in th\nDoc 5(Title: Freedom Versus Security: Can We Find the Right Balance?) \neally useful. When people see that public officials are taking this seriously, but also trying to help people, Then that increases the public’s will to adhere to these restrictions. And I think good examples of that range from things like cities passing new drinking ordinances Where people can drink outside So they don’t have to go inside to restaurants and bars to things like rent freezes. And those can be good, but they just didn’t seem to be permanent.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek [(](https://www.happyscribe.com/transcriptions/1f76a123ef414cc3984193047622c1a5/edit_v2?position=1016.76&utm_source=happyscribe&utm_medium=document_deep_link&utm_campaign=export_docx&utm_content=1f76a123ef414cc3984193047622c1a5)16:56)\n\nAnd then I also think trying to adopt some of these principles, Helping people understand that we’re probably going to be in this situation for many more months and most likely years to come. And so it’s not about finding a fix that lasts just a short amount of time.

These compromises also happen in everyday life, from seatbelt laws to food-safety regulations. A paper published in [_Perspectives on Psychological Science_](https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916211034499), however, suggests that restricting freedoms may have other unintended negative consequences for behavior and health. One of the authors, Nathan Cheek with Princeton University, explains how there may be a balance that can be achieved and how psychological science could help policymakers [promote public health](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/hero-epidemics-rt), safety, and well-being in times of crisis.\n\n_Auto-generated transcript_\n\n##### Charles Blue (00:12)\n\nThere is an often misstated and misunderstood quote by Benjamin Franklin, which reads, “Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither Liberty nor safety. Though often used rhetorically to denounce impositions or laws restricting certain behaviors, Franklin was actually referring to a specific tax dispute. This quote is therefore more accurately a pro-taxation and pro-defense spending statement than a quote supporting the absolute preservation of freedoms. During the Pandemic and other natural disasters, many actions are taken by governments to save lives at the cost of certain liberties. This is even in everyday life, from seatbelt laws to food safety regulations. The worthy objective of these restrictions is to protect people by imposing limits on what they are free to do. A new article published in _Perspectives on Psychological Science_, however, suggests there may be unintended consequences. Restricting freedoms may have negative consequences for behavior and health. This paper suggests that there is a balance that can be achieved and that psychology can help policymakers promote public health, safety, and well being when crises and disasters strike. I’m Charles Blue and you’re listening to Under the Cortex today.\n\n##### Charles Blue (01:33)\n\nI have with me, Nathan Cheek with Princeton University and lead author on this paper. Thank you for joining me today.\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (01:40)\n\nThanks so much for having me. I’m happy to be here to set the stage.\n\n##### Charles Blue (01:44)\n\nCan you tell us what did you set out to study and why?\n\n##### Nathan Cheek (01:49)\n\nAbsolutely. So my co-authors and I started having conversations about the many changes we were seeing in the wake of the Pandemic. So in the first few months, we saw dramatic world changes, extreme public policies that for many of us were relatively unprecedented, whether it was in the form of restrictions, social distancing requirements, work from home mandates, and many other things. And as these were unfolding, we were wondering what the psychological consequences would be of these dramatic changes. And then some early data coming out of Italy suggested that the psychology of freedom needed to be taken more seriously. And in fact, in a nationally representative sample of Italians, the most frequently reported new negative consequence of the lockdown was restricted freedom, even above things like financial burdens and social isolation. So clearly we need to be taking freedom seriously. As we were doing this work, we found that there were two broad clusters of negative consequences that seem to emerge when people face these kinds of new restrictions. The first is a cluster of mental and physical health consequences. It hurts to have freedom taken away, sometimes quite literally. And the second cluster was around negative behavioral responses ranging from things like noncompliance to more extreme manifestations of reactants in the form of, for example, public protest.\n\n##### Charles Blue (03:08)\n\nYour paper implies that there may be an imp\nDoc 2(Title: iberty suggests the speech of pimps — instigating clients and sex workers to have sex — should be restricted. This suggests he may be willing to curtail some speech undermining their decisional autonomy while not harming others.[38]) In her 1906 biography of Voltaire, Evelyn Beatrice Hall coined the following sentence to illustrate Voltaire's beliefs: \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it\".[39] Hall's quote is frequently cited to describe the principle of freedom of speech.[39] Noam Chomsky stated, \"If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Dictators such as Stalin and Hitler, were in favor of freedom of speech for views they liked only. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise\".[40] Lee Bollinger argues that \"the free speech principle involves a special act of carving out one area of social interaction for extraordinary self-restraint, the purpose of which is to develop and demonstrate a social capacity to control feelings evoked by a host of social encounters\". Bollinger argues that tolerance is a desirable value, if not essential. However, critics argue that society should be concerned by those who directly deny or advocate, for example, genocide (see limitations above).[41]\nAs chairman of the London-based PEN International, a club which defends freedom of expression and a free press, English author H. G. Wells met with Stalin in 1934 and was hopeful of reform in the Soviet Union. However, during their meeting in Moscow, Wells said, \"the free expression of opinion—even of opposition opinion, I do not know if you are prepared yet for that much freedom here\".[42]\nThe 1928 novel Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence was banned for obscenity in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, and India. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was the subject of landmark court rulings that saw the ban on obscenity overturned. Dominic Sandbrook of The Telegraph in the UK wrote, \"Now that public obscenity has become commonplace, it is hard to recapture the atmosphere of a society that saw fit to ban books such as Lady Chatterley's Lover because it was likely to 'deprave and corrupt' its readers\".[43] Fred Kaplan of The New York Times stated the overturning of the obscenity laws \"set off an explosion of free speech\" in the U.S.[44] The 1960s also saw the Free Speech Movement, a massive, long-lasting student protest on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, during the 1964–65 academic year.[45]\nIn contrast to Anglophone nations, France was a haven for literary freedom.[46] The innate French regard for the mind meant that France was disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare.[46] While it was prohibited everywhere else, James Joyce's Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922. Henry Miller's 1934 novel Tropic of Cancer (banned in the U.S. until 1963) and Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover were published in France decades before they were available in the respective authors' home countries.[46]\nIn 1964, comedian Lenny Bruce was arrested in the U.S. due to complaints again about his use of various obscenities. A three-judge panel presided over his widely publicized six-month trial. He was found guilty of obscenity in November 1964. He was sentenced on 21 December 1964, to four months in a workhouse.[47] He was set free on bail during the appeals process and died before the appeal was decided. On 23 December 2003, thirty-seven years after Bruce's death, New York Governor George Pataki granted him a posthumous pardon for his obscenity conviction.[48]\nIn some Asian countries, such as India, the right to freedom of speech and expression is not absolute.[49] While Article 19 of India’s constitution guarantees the right \"to freedom of speech and expression,\" the constitution \nDoc 3(Title:  a neutral arbiter, phrased in a resonant populism:\"It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes. Distinctions in society will always exist under every just government. Equality of talents, of education, or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions. In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics, and laborers--who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government. There are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses. If it would confine itself to equal protection, and, as Heaven does its rains, shower its favors alike on the high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be an unqualified blessing.\") Though some original Jackson men were flabbergasted and outraged at his turn against the Bank, the veto held up in Congress. It became the prime issue in the ensuing presidential campaign, with both sides distributing copies of Jackson's message. Jackson read his re-election as a mandate to pursue his attack on the Bank further.\nRemoval of the Deposits\nAs soon as the nullification crisis was resolved, Jackson took his next step. The Bank's open involvement in the presidential campaign convinced him more than ever of its inherent corruption. To draw its fangs until its charter ran out in 1836, he determined to withdraw the federal government's own deposits from the Bank and place them in selected state-chartered banks.\nThis was a maneuver requiring some delicacy. Under the charter, the secretary of the treasury, not the President, had authority to remove the deposits. He had also to explain his reasons to Congress, where the House of Representatives had just voted by a two-to-one margin that the deposits should stay where they were. Jackson canvassed his cabinet on removal. Most of them opposed it, but he got the support and arguments he needed from Attorney General Roger Taney. Jackson drew up a paper explaining his decision, read it to the cabinet, and ordered Treasury Secretary William John Duane to execute the removal. To Jackson's astonishment, Duane refused. He also refused to resign, so Jackson fired him and put Taney in his place. Taney ordered the removal, which was largely complete by the time Congress convened in December 1833.\nEven many congressional foes of the Bank could not countenance Jackson's proceedings against it. He had defied Congress's intent, rode roughshod over the treasury secretary's statutory control over the public purse, and removed the public funds from the lawfully authorized, responsible hands of the Bank of the United States to an untried, unregulated, and perhaps wholly irresponsible collection of state banks. To many, Jackson seemed to regard himself as above the law.\nFortunately for Jackson, Bank president Nicholas Biddle over-reacted and played into his hands. Regarding the removal of deposits as a declaration of open war, Biddle determined to force a recharter by creating a financial panic. Loss of the deposits required some curtailment of the Bank's loans, but Biddle carried the contraction further than was necessary in a deliberate effort to squeeze businessmen into demanding a recharter. This manipulation of credit for political ends served only to discredit the Bank and to vindicate Jackson's strictures against it.\nCongress did not even consider recharter, but it did lash out at Jackson. Clay men and Southern anti-tariffites could not agree on the American System; they could not all agree on rechartering the Bank; but they could unite in th\nDoc 4(Title: With the Freedom of Speech, the Responsibility to Listen) In December 1860, the great American orator and former slave Frederick Douglass delivered one of his finest speeches, “A Plea for Free Speech in Boston.” In it, he boldly declared that “liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one’s thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist.”\nThat line—and that speech—emerged from a rather unfortunate incident.\nThe week before Douglass issued his plea, a meeting was scheduled in Boston to discuss what was, in 1860, a controversial question: “How Shall Slavery be Abolished?” But before the meeting could make any progress, it was “invaded, insulted, [and] captured” by an unruly mob, who sought to silence the abolitionists.\nAs Douglass explained, the mayor “refused to protect” the meeting—or the free speech of the abolitionists—and instead, simply cancelled it.\nBut Frederick Douglass knew the real danger the mob posed was not in their disorder, but in denying their fellow citizens the right to free speech. So he did what anyone who seeks to defend free speech should do: he spoke up.\nIn Boston’s storied Music Hall, Douglass delivered his iconic, timeless oration about the incident, and about the importance of the freedom of speech. He said: “No right was deemed by the fathers of the Government more sacred than the right of speech. It was in their eyes, as in the eyes of all thoughtful men, the great moral renovator of society and government.” 2\n“Moral Renovator”: The power of free speech\nAs the phrase “moral renovator” suggests, free speech gives us the tools to repair, update, and improve our society and its principles, the way one might consider rebuilding a home. We can address damages, tear down harmful walls, open new doors, and even restore a crumbling foundation.\nThis power to remake ourselves is partially why the freedom of speech is enshrined in the very first amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and why it is the first freedom that President Roosevelt asserted in his iconic speech. It must come first because our right to speak freely is a prerequisite for all of our other freedoms—and for living in a free society.\nWithout freedom of speech, there is no preacher in the pulpit, no defense at a trial. Without freedom of speech, we cannot cast our vote or call our representatives. Without freedom of speech, there is no women’s suffrage or March on Washington, no marriage equality or Black Lives Matter or #MeToo movement.\nIt’s no wonder that Frederick Douglass called free speech the “dread of tyrants.” He knew that, as he put it, “Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, founded in injustice and wrong, are sure to tremble, if men are allowed to reason of righteousness, temperance and of a judgment to come in their presence.” Speech and reason are bulwarks against an unjust society.\nOf course, free speech is not a panacea; and while some speech allows us to confront injustice, there are plenty of instances when our speech can perpetuate injustice and harm. For example, on many college campuses today, students are testing and contesting where free speech ends and hate speech begins. It’s a question worth asking—and one, from my perspective, with no easy answer.\nBut what amazes me is that more than 240 years after our founding, and more than 150 years after Frederick Douglass’s stirring defense of the First Amendment, the freedom of speech is still vital to the functioning of our democracy.\nFree speech in our time\nWhen Frederick Douglass spoke in Boston, or when President Roosevelt outlined his Four Freedoms, neither could have imagined the extent to which free expression would change. We now have more ways to exercise this freedom than ever before. The internet allows us to transmit our ideas to an unknowably large audience of Facebook friends and Twitter followers, devoted readers and disgruntled trolls alike. Our smartphones let us make this connection anywhere, anytime.

ISBN 978-0520075436.) 'We are not among those communists who are out to destroy personal liberty, who wish to turn the world into one huge barrack or into a gigantic workhouse. There certainly are some communists who, with an easy conscience, refuse to countenance personal liberty and would like to shuffle it out of the world because they consider that it is a hindrance to complete harmony. But we have no desire to exchange freedom for equality. We are convinced ... that in no social order will freedom be assured as in a society based upon communal ownership.' Thus wrote the editors of the Journal of the Communist League in 1847, under the direct influence of the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.\n- ^ \"Где находится Екатериненштадт?

The outcome of today’s election is in the hands of those voters lucky enough to live in a battleground state.) But even these voters are not equal. A few of the battleground states are crucial, others less so. So which battleground states are which? And when, due to the unprecedented level of mail-in balloting, can we expect to know their outcomes?\nAt the top of the list are Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Florida alone could be the tip-off to the identity of the next president. It’s been on the winning side in 13 of the last 14 presidential elections, losing out only in the 1992 Bill Clinton-George H. W. Bush race. President Donald Trump won Florida by a mere 1 percentage point in 2016. Given that he’s behind by a larger margin in national polls this time, Trump likely has to win Florida again to have a chance of victory. Florida’s outcome could be known tonight or by early tomorrow morning. Unlike some states, Florida allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start before Election Day, and such ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted.\nWisconsin is another battleground state that’s more equal than others. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden were to carry Wisconsin, which Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016, he likely will carry the neighboring battleground states of Michigan and Minnesota. They split in 2016, with Hillary Clinton winning narrowly in Minnesota, Trump narrowly in Michigan. But, compared with Wisconsin’s voters, the voters in these two states lean more Democratic. Wisconsin is probably a must-win for Trump, but we might not know its outcome until late next week. Because of a Supreme Court ruling last week, only mail-in ballots received by Election Day will be counted in Wisconsin. Yet, its counting can’t start until Election Day and the state is not equipped to quickly tabulate large numbers of mail-in votes.\nPennsylvania has been a toss-up state in nearly every presidential election since 1976. Trump won by fewer than 50,000 votes in 2016 — this in a state where more than 6 million ballots were cast. Pennsylvania is nearly a must-win state for Biden and he’s in a stronger position there than Clinton was in 2016. Like Wisconsin, it might be late next week before we know the outcome in Pennsylvania. It has a high rate of mail-in balloting, and the count of these ballots can’t begin until Election Day. If the race in Pennsylvania is tight, a legal fight is certain. The Supreme Court declined to make a final decision on a ruling of Pennsylvania’s high court that the state could count ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 and received three days later. The late arriving ballots, for the moment, will be counted separately.\nArizona and North Carolina are in my next tier of important battleground states. Arizona is a new entry into the key battleground-state category. Once safely Republican, it has been trending Democratic due to its increasing Latino population. Unless it’s very close, Arizona’s outcome should be known early. Its mail-in votes can be counted as they arrive. If Trump were to lose Arizona, he likely would have to outperform expectations in the Rust Belt to pull off an Electoral College victory.\nFor its part, North Carolina is another state that Trump likely needs to win. It has gone Republican in four of the last five elections — the exception was 2008, when Barack Obama narrowly edged John McCain. Like Florida, North Carolina could provide an early indicator of the next president. It allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start in advance of Election Day.\nIn the lowest tier of this year’s battleground states are Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Texas. They’re what I would call the “gravy” category. If a combination of these states votes contrary to its recent history, we’re looking at either a lopsided Biden win or, if Trump wins, t\nDoc 2(Title:  lowest tier of this year’s battleground states are Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Texas. They’re what I would call the “gravy” category. If a combination of these states votes contrary to its recent history, we’re looking at either a lopsided Biden win or, if Trump wins, the greatest election comeback since Harry S. Truman beat Thomas Dewey in 1948. Each of these states allows the count of absentee and mail-in ballots to start before Election Day.) As for the 36 states not in this election’s battleground category, there should not be much suspense aside from the speed with which their ballots are counted. There could be a shocking outcome in one or two of these states but it appears unlikely at this point. If the electoral votes of the 36 non-battleground states (and the District of Columbia, which has three electoral votes) are allocated based on current polls, Trump has 130 votes locked up and Biden has 202. A total of 270 electoral votes are needed for victory.\nWhat’s the likelihood that 2020 will repeat 2016, when the national popular vote winner lost the presidency due to the Electoral College? If the most recent national polls are accurate, the odds are relatively high that Trump will be a one-term president. The larger the national popular vote margin, the less likely that the weaker candidate will have a path to an electoral vote victory.\nThomas E.

Currently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the popular vote nationally. For example, in this last election a Republican elector from Ohio would have to vote for Hillary Clinton because she won the popular vote nationally. A provision of the law is that it only takes effect when states comprising 270 electoral votes – a majority – all pass it. That’s nowhere close yet. Twelve states have passed this law. Connecticut had it before the legislature three or four years ago and it did not work its way through, but there is support for it here.\nShould there be electors in some states that change their vote on Dec. 19 and go against how they are supposed to vote, and the election results change, how could that be dealt with?\nBefore the Republican convention there was a lot of discussion of delegates not voting for Donald Trump. That didn’t happen. I don’t think it’s going to happen this time. If it did, it would be the kind of issue that makes your head explode. There would be an affirmation of the popular vote but it would be people voting not according to the way the people in their state dictated that they should vote. As noted, there have been faithless electors over time, but it’s never shaped the outcome of an election. This time around it would be, as Donald Trump would say, huge.\nWe advocate to other nations as they are moving toward democracy to let the people decide their elected representatives, but the people don’t really decide here if the winner of the popular vote doesn’t win. How do we as nation reconcile that?\nMost democracies are parliamentary systems, not a three branch system such as we have. It has not been uncommon in Great Britain, for example, for one party to get more aggregate votes for its parliamentary delegation, yet the other party gets more seats. We’re not unique in that regard. Secondly, we are a federal system, and the Electoral College is one of the things that makes federalism real. If you think federalism is a good thing, then you want to keep the Electoral College. Concurrent with the existence of the Electoral College, even with several occasions when the winner of the popular vote hasn’t won the election, advocates of the present system might say that the United States emerged as the most powerful and at times richest country in history. We defeated communism and fascism, we had some great political leaders and some duds as well. The Electoral College has not destroyed American democracy.\nYou served as a Connecticut elector in 2012. What was that experience like for you?\nIt was really just one of the rituals of American democracy. One of the electors was criticized in the early days of the republic because he had been chosen to vote as a Federalist but voted for the Jeffersonians. One of his critics said, “We employed you not to think, but to act.” I acted and cast my ballot, placing it in a box that was carved out of the original Charter Oak Tree used every four years only for this purpose. The ballots were already marked for Obama and Biden. There was not much discretion there. It seemed to me it was a symbolic way of affirming the ongoing nature of the Presidency. I didn’t have to think – just to act.\nDoc 4(Title: rategy is a massive gamble. On its face it seems like a weird mistake, coming from an accomplished salesman who knows that the customer is always right. The last time Americans elected someone who had never held elected office before, they went with Dwight Eisenhower, a man who entered the race with high name recognition thanks to his role as supreme commander of the Allied Forces during World War II. Trump starred on “The Apprentice.” But anything is possible, so Democrats have to take the threat that he could be elected president — thanks to a wave of support from white men — seriously. “The white male vote is going to decide the race,” John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock, Pa. said. “If Trump can pull Reagan voters, he’s going to win. And we can’t let that happen.”) The Clinton camp is prepared for a grueling general election. In an interview with PBS NewsHour the day after she clinched the Democratic nomination, Clinton said she plans to ignore Trump’s personal attacks against her. But Trump is “attempting to drive wedges between and among Americans,” Clinton added, “and I am not going to stand by and be silent as he tries to do that.” Earlier this year, Priorities USA Action, the main Super PAC backing Clinton, and other organizations began running ads highlighting Trump’s sexist rhetoric. “That will be a continuing part of the race,” said Geoff Garin, a pollster at Priorities USA who served as Clinton’s chief strategist in the final months of her 2008 run for the White House.\nPredicting presidential elections is a fraught enterprise. One of the best models belongs to Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. His research shows that the three deciding factors are a sitting president’s approval rating in the summer months before an election; second-quarter economic growth in an election year; and how many terms the party in power has been in the White House. By those standards, Clinton is in good but not great shape right now. But unforeseen forces exist that can sometimes upend the best prediction models, and Trump is the very definition of an unforeseen force.\nAs Donald Rumsfeld famously said, “there are known knowns,” “known unknowns,” and “unknown unknowns.” Hillary Clinton is a known entity. And it’s clear that Trump needs to outperform Romney by a lot with white men to make up for his historically low level of support from women and non-white voters. Most of his votes will come from Republicans. But Trump is going to make a gendered appeal to independent and Democratic white men as well, and it’s impossible to predict how that will go. We’ve never had a woman at the top of a Democratic or Republican ticket before. Gender is the great known unknown of the 2016 election.\nTo some, the choice between a former first lady, senator and secretary of state and a real estate developer-turned-reality T.V. star will feel like a no-brainer. But for others it won’t be that easy. They’ll have doubts and fears, if they don’t already. They’ll be concerned about Clinton’s policies, her personality, her email server and paid speeches on Wall Street. In the end, a certain percentage of white men aren’t going to vote for Clinton in November, and if it’s a large enough number Clinton is going to lose. And some of those men will not vote for Clinton simply because she’s a woman, though they may not acknowledge that to pollsters or even themselves.\nSign up for the PBS NewsHour Politics Newsletter\nReceive political analysis on Friday from Mark Shields and David Brooks and on Monday from Amy Walter and Tamara Keith.

On another occasion, Trump spoke highly of China's President Xi being president for life and joked to great applause that maybe \"we'll give that a shot someday.\"\nThough he once claimed he'd done more in his first two years in office than any other President in US history (George Washington and Franklin Roosevelt, among others, might have something to say about that), Trump is certainly no great student of the presidency. As such, he is likely unaware of an intriguing trend among his three predecessors that may carry consequences for 2020.\nIndeed, sometimes presidential trivia can be, well, not so trivial.\nConsider this: Minus the FDR exception (he served multiple terms in office before the advent of modern-day term limits), we have now had three two-term presidents in a row: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The last time that sequence occurred was well over two centuries ago, with a trio of like-minded chief executives: Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe (1801-1825).\nIndeed, what makes the contemporary trio even more unique is that unlike their historical predecessors, who represented a kind of self-perpetuating political dynasty (they lived within 30 miles of one another, all knew each another, and hailed from the same state and political party), Clinton, Bush and Obama were wildly different as people and as presidents. Between 1996 and 2012, Americans managed to elect two Democrats and a Republican to second terms who were each distinct in style, personality, and political orientation.\nSo what does this pattern say about the presidency and our current politics -- and what, if anything, might it portend for 2020?\nThe incumbent's home-court advantage\nSome might say not much. The factors and circumstances that led to these presidents' reelections were just too varied and idiosyncratic to draw any broader conclusions. Still, with only 13 consecutive two-termers out of 44 past presidents (roughly 31%) and only five since the death of FDR, three consecutive two-termers is no small matter.\nNo matter how you cut it, three consecutive two-termers in command of the presidency demonstrate the vast power available to the modern-day incumbent. The capacity of presidents to direct that power to solve problems may be vastly overrated -- animated in the public's imagination by, for example, a president played by Harrison Ford single-handedly killing terrorists aboard Air Force One.\nStill, as Aaron Sorkin noted in his script for the 1995 movie \"The American President,\" the White House represents \"the single greatest home-court advantage in the modern world.\" This is especially true in the age of 24-hour news, where a president commands extraordinary and immediate visibility.\nCongress and the Supreme Court may go in and out of session, but the President is the Energizer Bunny of American politics -- always on and ever present. It's no coincidence that in the last 11 elections with incumbent candidates, incumbents prevailed eight times, leaving just three -- Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush -- as lonely one- or partial-termers.\nIt's easy to see why incumbents have such an advantage. As President Trump has demonstrated with frightening clarity, presidents dominate the national and media narratives; we see or hear them daily, in Trump's case often hourly. They wield the powers of government; their policy priorities and re-election campaigns are launched even before their first term begins; and that initial success not only creates an existing campaign organization and donor bases but can also drive the perception that the election is theirs to lose.\nWhat our modern-day two-term presidents can tell us\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were all reelected for vastly different reasons. What matters is that they all won second terms. It's also worth pointing out, as we lo\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems Donald Trump is still actively involved in the election process and particularly needs to secure battleground states like Florida, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania to have a chance of winning.

    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it is clear that 9/11 had significant impacts on the USA and the world. It dramatically shifted foreign policy towards a focus on combating terrorism, especially from non-state actors like Al-Qaeda. It led to the USA engaging in prolonged conflicts in Afghanistan and later Iraq. It caused immense economic and social changes, including heightened security measures domestically. It also resulted in significant backlash against Muslims and Arabs globally, leading to discrimination and hate crimes. \n\nIf 9/11 did not occur, the USA would likely have continued focusing on other global issues like the Cold War, maintaining alliances, and addressing economic challenges rather than shifting priorities to counter-terrorism. Relations with Middle Eastern countries, especially those harboring terrorist groups, might have been less strained. There would likely be fewer wars and less focus on military engagements in the Middle East.\n\nGiven these points, the world would likely be significantly different without 9/11. No wars, less focus on anti-terrorism globally, possibly better relations with certain Middle Eastern nations, and no significant backlash against Muslims and Arabs.\n\nThe exact specifics vary widely but it's clear the absence of 9/11 would fundamentally alter the course of international affairs. \n\n<answer> significantly different </answer>\n\nThe absence of 9/11 would likely make the world significantly different in terms of global conflicts, diplomatic relations, and social dynamics.",

Over 90 nations lost people in those two Towers.\nAnd then we realized that they were also attacking the Pentagon, had attacked the Pentagon, and that fourth plane that crashed in the field in Pennsylvania might have been heading to the White House or might have been heading to my own department, the State Department. It might have been heading right to this building that we're sitting in here today. You realize that there's a strike directly at the capital of a superpower, the capital of the leader of the world that wants to be free: Washington.\nSIR DAVID FROST: And there's been talk about the intelligence and other things. Condoleezza Rice said, \"I don't think there was any personal failure on my part, but I keep on thinking, 'How could I have done something different. Is there any way I could have known?'\" I mean, you must all have had that.\nSECRETARY POWELL: We all go through that. And I've been in many crisis situations in the course of my career as a soldier, as a National Security Advisor, and now as Secretary of State, and whenever something happens that is a surprise, a shock, some tragedy occurs, you immediately start thinking, \"Is there anything that we could have done differently? Was there any information that came to me earlier that should have suggested this was going to happen?\"\nIn this instance, I've played that tape over and over. We knew that something was going on. Our Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, throughout the summer was giving us warnings: There's something going on, something's happening, something's going to happen; we're not sure what it is. But we've never had enough insight or fidelity into reports we were getting to have predicted something of this magnitude or this nature. It was something we had never seen before. I mean, we look for bombs, we look for terrorists, but we never thought one of our airplanes would be the bomb or where it would be heading, or people had made such an elaborate plan to pull this off. We had no insight into the nature of that plan.\nSIR DAVID FROST: And so how has foreign policy changed as a result of 9/11? How has your approach -- swapping the once-Communist enemy for the terrorist enemy, and yet that's a vague and elusive force -- how has it changed the job you do?\nSECRETARY POWELL: It became a new kind of enemy. It wasn't a state. It was an organization that found safe harbor in many states -- here in the United States, Saudi Arabia, in Pakistan, in Asia. There are al-Qaida cells all over the world. And it was not a state; it knew no boundary, it knew no territory that you could go attack. Yes, you could go attack Pakistan and get rid of the Taliban and get rid of the headquarters, but that wasn't getting rid of all of al-Qaida.\nSIR DAVID FROST: Was it difficult putting this coalition together in the last year, to the Gulf War coalition?\nSECRETARY POWELL: A lot different. In the case of the Gulf War, there was a front -- the Iraqi army sitting in Kuwait -- and a different kind of coalition was needed and it was easy to get the UN mobilized. And what we had to do was put an army in that part of the world to get the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. This was a little different.

Two planes, hijacked by Islamic jihadists vowing death to all Americans, plowed into both towers at the World Trade Center in New York. Another plane was flown into the Pentagon in Washington, DC. A fourth plane, presumably headed for the White House or the U.S. Capitol, was heroically diverted by passengers and ended up crashing in an empty field in Pennsylvania. After reports of the first plane hitting the North Tower, millions watched the second plane hit the South Tower on live television.\nIt was a terrifying, startling, and humbling event for the country. The 9/11 attacks were the deadliest on American soil since the shock attack at Pearl Harbor 60 years before, and the sense of outrage was reminiscent of that moment. The attacks in New York occurred in the country’s busiest city on a busy workday. And the staggered nature of the attacks meant that news footage captured almost everything as it happened, ensuring that millions of Americans saw the events precisely as they unfolded.\nTimeline\nSeptember 11, 2001\n5:45 AM – Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al-Omari, two of the intended hijackers, pass through security at the Portland International Jetport in Maine.

Despite all that was going on, 9:02 a.m. on September 11, 2001, was the last minute of my life that was free of the obligation of noticing.) The rhetoric around 9/11 is always that it was this massive singular event that will never be replicated. That we should #NeverForget it. That it’s special. It’s not. Little 9/11s happen constantly. We often create them out of situations that didn’t have to be disasters at all.\nUnsurprisingly, the people who suffer the most in disasters big and small are often the people with the least agency — kids. Every day in America, millions of children head to school worried that a random act of gun violence could end their lives. Kids in Flint, Michigan, prepare for school without clean water or living with the complicated legacies of having gone years without that resource. Kids in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Houston, Texas, get dressed in homes and neighborhoods still dealing with flood damage or flooding anew. Kids in California wake up in neighborhoods suffused with smoke from acres-wide fires and have to pretend it’s like any other day. Kids living in pandemic hot zones or, frankly, anywhere in America in 2020 and 2021, watch their world shrink overnight.\nThe experience of 9/11 may have been on a larger scale than a few of these, an act of mass violence paired with a major health and environmental disaster, but that doesn’t mean that these individual crises aren’t bad enough on their own. Lives are irrevocably changed by smaller disasters, too.\nOften the way we process the scale of a disaster isn’t really about how big it is, anyway. A lot of big and little 9/11s happen to kids and communities that don’t have the coattails of responders or other designated “heroes” to ride or financial resources to throw around or voices the media is willing to seek out. Even with the clarifying effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on many Americans, we at most do some hand-wringing. We ask, “What did we do to create this problem?” Then we do nothing.\nOccasionally, when adults fail to take proper stock of the situation, we leave kids to ask what’s going on themselves. March for Our Lives, the impressive organization that was formed by student survivors in the aftermath of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, is an outgrowth of a system in which adults shirked their duty to think critically about the role they had played in creating a crisis. It shouldn’t have been on the kids who were victimized to inquire about the policies that led to their trauma, but somebody had to.\nIn 2006, fresh out of college, I started an advocacy organization called StuyHealth that advocates for young adults impacted by the 9/11 disaster and the World Trade Center cleanup. Ever since I have been doing the work of raising the profile of that story and letting the students of 9/11 know about the services available to them. In 2019, I testified before Congress alongside comedian Jon Stewart and 9/11 first responder Det. Lou Alvarez, who has since died of cancer, to make sure students would be a part of the Zadroga Act’s permanent renewal.\nIf we learn anything from the slow-rolling, still simmering COVID-19 crisis, I hope it’s this: That preemptive action to save people from suffering is always a good idea. That it’s worth a risk to the economy to make sure people are safe. People are our most important asset, not financial indicators. In the aftermath of a crisis, however, I don’t think that we should be initially preoccupied with how we allowed the crisis to happen. When the damage is done, what we should ask first is, “How can we protect survivors from further harm?”\nPeople rarely mention the unpleasant reality that is living with the long-term consequences of a disaster, but we do see glimmers of it in the news sometimes in reports, for example, about GoFundMe accounts popping up for gunshot victims and cancer p\nDoc 4(Title: geted Arabs, Muslims, and South Asians in the aftermath of 9/11, the “war on terror” has had an impact on all immigrants regardless of ethnicity or legal status—including Latin American immigrants, particularly Mexicans, who comprise the majority of immigration detainees. Post-9/11 policies not only increased funding for various immigration-enforcement functions as part of the broader effort to enhance national security, but fostered an “us or them” mentality in which “they” are the foreign-born.) More precisely, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 collectively “illustrate the accelerating criminalization of the immigration system.” This intersection of criminal and immigration law has led to a notable increase in deportations. As Stumpf notes, in the period “between 1908 and 1980, there were approximately 56,000 immigrants deported based on criminal convictions. In 2004 alone, there were more than 88,000 such deportations.” While immigration law had been used by U.S. authorities to remove non-citizens who came into contact with the criminal justice system in the pre-9/11 era, the relationship between these two systems of law intensified after 9/11. As law professor Teresa A. Miller notes, “After the attacks, zero-tolerance enforcement of immigration laws was extended to immigrants who had not passed through the criminal justice system, such as asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants.” The PATRIOT Act in particular allowed federal officers to apprehend and detain “non-citizens on immigration grounds without legal review and without public disclosure of the specific charge for a period of seven days, or for a maximum of six months if the case is deemed a national security risk.”\nThe “war on terror” thus had immediate implications for foreign-born individuals residing in the United States. As Miller states: “In January of 2002, Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson announced a new initiative to ‘locate, apprehend, interview, and deport’ approximately 314,000 noncitizens who had been ordered deported, but had failed to comply with their deportation orders.” This initiative led to the arrest of more than 1,100 Muslim and Arab men without formally charging them with a crime. However, the consequences of the PATRIOT Act extended beyond these individuals and into immigrant communities, ultimately being manifested through “racial profiling and scapegoating, mass detentions and mistreatment, and the government’s refusal to disclose information about those detained.”\nA prime example of the enforcement-only mindset of DHS and its component agencies in the post-9/11 era is “Operation Endgame”—the name given to the “Office of Detention and Removal Strategic Plan, 2003–2012,” which was released on June 27, 2003, by Anthony S. Tangeman, Director of ICE’s Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO). Tangeman succinctly explains the rationale underlying his department’s new strategic plan:\nAs the title implies, DRO provides the endgame to immigration enforcement and that is the removal of all removable aliens. This is also the essence of our mission statement and the ‘golden measure’ of our success. We must endeavor to maintain the integrity of the immigration process and protect our homeland by ensuring that every alien who is ordered removed, and can be, departs the United States as quickly as possible and as effectively as practicable. We must strive for 100% removal rate.\nHowever, Tangeman’s assertions about how best to “protect our homeland” ring hollow given that the vast majority of immigrants aren’t criminals (let alone terrorists), and that even minor infractions can render an immigrant “deportable” under current law. Yet the Tangeman memo, and the strategic plan it introduces, treat all immigrants as potential security ris\nDoc 5(Title: WASHINGTON — Where were you on 9/11?) It’s a question so many of us have repeated over the past two decades. It’s a way we relate to one another as we reflect on the day of one of the most horrific attacks on the American people in U.S. history – Sept. 11, 2001. For the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), we join the rest of the country this Sunday in remembering and honoring the lives of so many who were tragically taken from us during the terroristic events that took place in New York City, Washington D.C., and Shanksville, Pennsylvania twenty-one years ago.\nEvery generation seems to have their own day in history that impacted them. Tragic events like the attack on Pearl Harbor and the assassinations of the President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., were mournful memories etched in everyone’s minds at the time. If we were alive then, we remember for the most part where we were, what we were doing and how we heard the news. However, the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were unlike anything ever seen before because for the first time in history, death and destruction on a massive scale was actually televised and updated in real time.\nIt was at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on that Tuesday morning when the first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. The second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center at 9:03 a.m. News anchors announced that planes were being hijacked and used by terrorists as guided missiles … the nation was under attack. Thirty-four minutes later, at 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight 77, crashes into the Pentagon collapsing part of the building. Then at 9:59 a.m., the burning WTC South Tower collapses. Four minutes later, at 10:03 a.m., United Airlines Flight 93, crashes in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. At 10:28 a.m., the WTC’s North Tower collapsed. In just 102 minutes, 19 hijackers would succeed in taking the lives of 2,977 Americans and terrorizing the entire country with the entire world watching in horror.\nYet, in the midst of this unimaginable tragedy, stories of unbelievable heroism were being reported from every location. Firefighters and law enforcement officers running into the burning World Trade Center buildings, rescuing hundreds of people. Service members leading others through the burning, smoldering Pentagon rubble to safety. Passengers of flight 93 who decided to fight back against hijackers to prevent them getting to their intended target. The selfless sacrifice would come to define that day as much, if not more so than the attacks themselves.\nOur world looks much different today. The wars that came after Sept. 11, 2001 are over. While the fight against terrorism still remains, what’s left of the persistent conflict in the middle east looks like it too will soon draw to a close. There are men and women entering service that weren’t even alive twenty-one years ago. But for those of us who were in uniform or were deciding to join the military, nothing strengthened our resolve to “support and defend” our Constitution, our nation and our way of life more than 9/11. Like the rest of our fellow Americans who were present then, that day changed us forever.\nThis Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, the VFW encourages every American to pause and honor the victims, reflect on the extraordinary courage of first responders and ordinary citizens alike, pay tribute to those who took the fight to the enemy and sacrificed to protect and defend our freedom, and never let Sept. 11, 2001, fade from our memory.\nAlways remember.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that 9/11 had significant impacts on the USA and the world. It dramatically shifted foreign policy towards a focus on combating terrorism, especially from non-state actors like Al-Qaeda. It led to the USA engaging in prolonged conflicts in Afghanistan and later Iraq. It caused immense economic and social changes, including heightened security measures domestically. It also resulted in significant backlash against Muslims and Arabs globally, leading to discrimination and hate crimes. \n\nIf 9/11 did not occur, the USA would likely have continued focusing on other global issues like the Cold War, maintaining alliances, and addressing economic challenges rather than shifting priorities to counter-terrorism. Relations with Middle Eastern countries, especially those harboring terrorist groups, might have been less strained. There would likely be fewer wars and less focus on military engagements in the Middle East.\n\nGiven these points, the world would likely be significantly different without 9/11. No wars, less focus on anti-terrorism globally, possibly better relations with certain Middle Eastern nations, and no significant backlash against Muslims and Arabs.\n\nThe exact specifics vary widely but it's clear the absence of 9/11 would fundamentally alter the course of international affairs. \n\n<answer> significantly different </answer>\n\nThe absence of 9/11 would likely make the world significantly different in terms of global conflicts, diplomatic relations, and social dynamics.",

The fossil fuel lobby group Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) and its affiliated oil and gas operators—which include BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil, and TotalEnergies—[strategically leveraged](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2023/10/cold-homes-hot-profits) privileged access to exert influence on legislation. Replicating Italian oil company Eni’s [strategy to capitalize](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eni-can-supply-more-gas-help-reduce-russia-reliance-2022-03-18/) on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, OEUK representatives [met with ministers](https://www.desmog.com/2023/10/24/revealed-the-oil-and-gas-lobbying-campaign-to-water-down-windfall-tax/) more than 200 times to lobby against the United Kingdom’s windfall tax proposal to put a levy on oil and gas producers.\n\nIn some cases, this manipulation even extends into multilateral spaces. World climate leaders and activists—with the United States [notably absent](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/16/cop28-john-kerry-backs-uae-appointment-oil-chief)—[voiced concerns](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/cop28-uae-sparks-backlash-by-appointing-oil-chief-as-president.html) over the UAE hosting the annual UNFCCC COP28 and [appointing the CEO](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/07/meet-the-oil-man-tasked-with-saving-the-planet-cop28) of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company as the COP28 president. Days before COP28 commenced in Dubai, however, [leaked documents indicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67508331) that the UAE was using its presidency to seek lucrative oil and gas deals with a range of government officials. If true, this would show an unprecedented industry capture of the multilateral climate space, directly undermining global climate progress at a time when scientists warn that the [window to reach Paris Agreement goals is closing](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/time-running-out-defuse-climate-time-bomb).\n\nIn all of these cases, the industry’s anti-democratic strategy is clear: manipulate the levers of power to obstruct any climate policies that may reduce the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, even—or especially—when the public supports those policies.\n\n##### Read more\n\n* * *\n\n### Tactic 3: Directly undermine democratic functions and freedoms\n\nWhile polluting public discourse and manipulating governments represent indirect attacks on democratic systems, the fossil fuel industry and its allies further strengthen their influence by directly undermining the fundamental rights at the heart of free societies. They do this in three main ways: 1) by filing expensive, protracted [strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs)](https://earthjustice.org/experts/coby-dolan/its-time-to-end-strategic-lawsuits-against-public-participation-slapp); 2) by pushing anti-protest legislation; and 3) by promoting voter suppression policies.\n\nIn response to the 2016 Standing Rock protests in the United States, Dakota Access Pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners [filed](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/22/545310247/dakota-access-pipeline-owner-sues-greenpeace-for-criminal-activity) a [SLAPP](https://earthjustice.org/experts/coby-dolan/its-time-to-end-strategic-lawsuits-against-public-participation-slapp) against protesters to prevent similar demonstrations from spreading. Other instances abound, with fossil fuel companies often misusing anti-racketeering Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) laws against protesters simply to “[send a message](https://www.texasobserver.org/kelcy-warrens-defamation-suit-has-beto-orourke-spoiling-for-a-fight/),” even when they know their chan\nDoc 5(Title: These Fossil Fuel Industry Tactics Are Fueling Democratic Backsliding) \n, with fossil fuel companies often misusing anti-racketeering Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) laws against protesters simply to “[send a message](https://www.texasobserver.org/kelcy-warrens-defamation-suit-has-beto-orourke-spoiling-for-a-fight/),” even when they know their chances of winning these lawsuits are slim.\n\nSimilar examples of such lawsuits exist outside the United States. In Italy, for example, oil company Eni has similarly deployed lawsuits against protesters and fossil fuel dissenters to delay climate action: In July 2023, Eni [filed a SLAPP](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/italy-months-after-ngos-bring-first-climate-lawsuit-in-italy-eni-responds-with-a-slapp-lawsuit/) against Greenpeace Italy and ReCommon, and in 2021, the company [filed a claim](http://www.giannibarbacetto.it/2020/12/06/eni-la-super-causa-per-mettere-il-bavaglio-al-fatto-quotidiano/) against Italian newspaper _Il Fatto Quotidiano_ for defamation.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry’s attempts to undermine democratic freedoms also include [support](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-19/oil-companies-persuade-states-to-make-pipeline-protests-a-felony#xj4y7vzkg) for [anti-protest laws](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/) that seek to silence public criticism by criminalizing protest activity. As a result of these efforts, some U.S. states have [enacted anti-protest laws](https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/S58) that carry severe sentences for [vague, speech-chilling charges](https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/Senate/PDF/S58v7.pdf) such as attempting to “obstruct, impede, or impair the services or transmissions of an energy facility.”\n\nMeanwhile, in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has implemented both the [Public Order Act of 2023](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/police-powers-ban-protest-laws-suella-braverman/) and the [Policing, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/12/what-is-the-law-on-the-right-to-protest-in-the-uk) (PCSA), which undermine fundamental freedoms to assemble and demonstrate. Right-wing think tank Policy Exchange, which is funded by major fossil fuel companies and their allies, [helped draft](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/rishi-sunak-right-wing-think-tank-anti-protest-laws-policy-exchange/) [the legislation](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/braverman-jets-in-but-will-migrants-fly-out/). Since the passage of the PSCA, numerous U.K. climate activists, particularly those operating under the [Just Stop Oil](https://time.com/6334072/just-stop-oil-climate-change-activist-group/) umbrella, [have been arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/30/met-arrest-more-than-60-climate-activists-just-stop-oil-protest-first-use-powers-public-order-act) for their protest activities.\n\n> The oil and gas industry’s voter suppression efforts are directly connected to its goal of thwarting the fight against climate change.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has also played a major role in promoting voter suppression, which disproportionately affects voters who most strongly favor climate and environmental justice policies. Between 2015 and 2020, fossil fuel interests [donated millions](https://www.climatejusticecenter.org/publication/voter-suppression-and-the-pic) to state lawmakers who backed voter suppression bills. This support includes funding the organizations leading the voter suppression charge. For example, fossil fuel giant Koch Industries is a [key funder](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=ALEC_Corporations#For-Profit_Corporations) of organizations such as the [Honest Elections Project](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/09/the-big-money-behind-the-big-lie), a spinoff of the right-wing [American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/how-the-american-legi\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it appears that while there is a push towards renewable energy, fossil fuel industries are actively trying to obstruct climate policies and manipulate political systems to maintain their influence. However, the feasibility of replacing fossil fuels with alternative energies depends more on technological advancements and adoption rates rather than just political resistance. Let me search specifically on the technological feasibility:\n<search> Technological feasibility of replacing fossil fuels with alternative energy </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: upercharging the new energy era of renewables, efficiency, and electrification) 22 July 2025\nThis special report provides a high-level synthesis of the state of play of accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy, with a particular focus on the roles of renewables, electrification, and energy efficiency.\nReportUNCCD | Drought Hotspots Around the World 2023-2025\n2 July 2025\nThe latest report by UNCCD, the U.S. National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) and the International Drought Resilience Alliance (IDRA), identifies the regions most severely affected by droughts in 2023–2024.

A device that requires its own dedicated power plant would leave considerable evidence of its existence. Certain very capable organizations (such as national governments) might be able to conceal such a project, but doing so would not be easy and could well be impossible for smaller organizations.) The fourth reason has to do with the relative resources required for various quantum computing applications. As with most technical questions regarding the future of quantum computers, there is a huge amount of uncertainty here. But there is fairly strong theoretical evidence that many commercial applications of quantum computers will be significantly technically easier to implement than Shor's algorithm. There is already very active research into the question of whether even today's crude quantum computers, known as noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, might be able to deliver practical applications in the near future, although we don't yet know for sure.\nIn a more conservative technical scenario, all useful quantum applications might require a technically challenging hardware stabilization process known as quantum error correction, which has very high hardware requirements. But even in this scenario, there is evidence that some commercial applications of quantum computers (like the scientific modeling of chemical catalysis) will require lower hardware resources than Shor's algorithm does. For example, one recent analysis estimated that computationally modeling a chemical catalyst used for direct air carbon capture would require only 20 percent as many qubits as executing Shor's algorithm would. (A qubit is the basic building block of a quantum computer and one of the simplest ways to quantify its hardware performance.)\nThese analyses imply that commercial applications of quantum computing will very likely become technically feasible before decryption does. Unless an organization attempting to develop a CRQC is far more technically advanced than the commercial sector—which is unlikely, given the potentially huge economic value mentioned above—commercial companies will probably beat the organization to applications, and they will announce their success. Even in the unlikely event that an organization does manage to develop a CRQC before the commercial industry develops a commercially useful quantum computer, that organization will face an enormously high opportunity cost of not using its CRQC for commercial applications that could deliver billions of dollars of value. Even if the organization were government sponsored, its government sponsor would face an enormous economic incentive to use its quantum computer for commercial applications rather than for intelligence collection.\nWhat this means for policymakers is that the ultimate worst-case scenario, in which a hostile actor secretly deploys a CRQC for many years against totally unsuspecting victims, is highly unlikely. This does not in any way lessen the importance of quickly upgrading all critical communications systems to post-quantum cryptography, however, since doing so defends against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, in which a CRQC is deployed retroactively against saved encrypted data that was intercepted previously.\nOperators of communications systems that transmit highly sensitive information should already be preparing to upgrade those systems' cryptography to PQC, and they should perhaps develop contingency plans for even further accelerating that adoption if signs arise that CRQCs are approaching unexpectedly quickly. But policymakers should also understand that the commercial applications of quantum computers will probably emerge well before intelligence-collection applications do.

For instance, the [American Petroleum Institute](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/politics/big-oil-disinformation-record-profits-climate/index.html) (API) regularly publicizes its member companies’ [investments in renewable energy and carbon reduction technologies](https://www.api.org/climate).

Individuals within the oil and gas industry have [bluntly admitted](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/07/1198301817/oil-company-wants-to-be-a-big-player-in-carbon-sucking-climate-tech-with-a-catch) that proposals such as these serve more as ways to “shut up whoever we need to shut up” than to [actually solve the climate crisis](https://www.ciel.org/reports/direct-air-capture-big-oils-latest-smokescreen-november-2023/). Internal communications from major fossil fuel companies show [similar contradictions](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2022.09.14%20FINAL%20COR%20Supplemental%20Memo.pdf)—such as Shell’s guidance to employees urging them “not give the impression that Shell is willing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels that do not make business sense.”\n\nAnother influence tactic used by the fossil fuel industry and its allies is “[astroturfing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/climate/fti-consulting.html),” by which they create an artificial appearance of grassroots support for an industry-friendly policy while concealing the support’s true origins. For example, the [anti-offshore wind organization](https://newrepublic.com/article/173929/nj-county-drafts-right-wing-legal-movement-anti-wind-fight) [American Coalition for Ocean Protection](https://oceanlegaldefense.org/) (ACOP) is a project of the [Caesar Rodney Institute](https://www.caesar\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that while fossil fuel industries are trying to obstruct climate policies and manipulate political systems, technological advancements are rapidly improving the feasibility of transitioning to alternative energies.

For example, men who are imprisoned engage in sexual behaviors with other men, but do so out of sexual necessity, not because of erotic interest in another man. They desire the behavior and the sexual release it achieves, and the gender of the partner is secondary.) Why Men Have Sex with Men\nFor straight men who have sex with men, same-sex encounters aren’t about romance or sexual attraction and desire, but about sexual and physiological arousal—”getting off” with another who’s male and accessible. They don’t sexually desire or get aroused by looking at other men, only by the sexual act. But if they don’t actively desire other men, how do they get to the point of having sex with them? These men typically want to bond with and get affection from other men. Their behavior may reflect a desire to experiment, to engage in something that’s taboo, or to express inner psychological conflicts involving their sexual feelings and desires that have nothing to do with having a gay or bisexual identity.\nStraight men who have sex with men do so for a variety of reasons. Some have been sexually abused and are compulsively reenacting childhood sexual trauma by male perpetrators; some find sexual release with another man more accessible; some have sex with men because it’s easier and requires fewer social skills than those required to have sex with women; some are “gay for pay” and get financial rewards; some like the attention they receive from other men; some like anal sex, which they’re otherwise too ashamed to talk about or engage in with their female partners.\nWhen I learn that a straight client is having sex with men, I ask a series of questions: What is your interest in men? Do you prefer one type over another? Do you feel drawn and compelled to satisfy your sexual urges with men? Do you care about the physical appearance of the man? Do women play any role in the fantasy? Is it different for you if they aren’t? I also try to listen for the themes running through their sexual interests and fantasies, which often decode aspects of their personal identity and histories.\nI used this approach with Paul. When I asked him to describe his situation, he told me he was sexually aroused only by women, and that his fantasies mostly were about women and brought him to orgasm. I asked him what the men who were occasionally included in his fantasies looked like, and he told me that they were faceless; even their physiques didn’t matter to him. Paul also told me that he always had sexual fantasies about men “controlling him” by telling him to please them. His most common and peak erotic fantasies included being “hypnotized or drugged” by the man whose spell he was under.\nLinks with the Past\nIn subsequent sessions, I asked Paul about sexual abuse because it can lead to homosexual behavior (not homosexual orientation), but he denied it. His father, he told me, was an alcoholic who frequently physically abused and humiliated him. Because Paul wasn’t good at sports, his father taunted him, calling him a “girly” man. To test his mettle as a fighter, his father once initiated a fist fight that left Paul bruised and bleeding from his mouth. He longed to have his father’s love and acceptance, but didn’t know how to get it. His mother never intervened; instead, she’d comfort her son after these abusive episodes.\nPaul was sympathetic to his mother. He saw how his father humiliated and intimidated her. Although she was never beaten, she lived under the threat of violence. He recalled that, as a child, he hated his father and wished him dead, so that he and his mother could have a nice life together.\nI consider sexual fantasies and erotic interests—whether expressed in healthy or unhealthy ways—as inseparable extensions of our core identity.

While we may believe we’ve accurately assessed whether a client is gay, it isn’t up to us as therapists to make this judgment.\nUnderstanding Straight Men Who Have Sex with Men\nThere’s growing evidence that many men who have sex with men aren’t all gay or bisexual. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 3 million men who self-identify as straight secretly have sex with other men—putting their wives or girlfriends at risk for HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections.\nTo best treat these men, therapists and clients need to be able to differentiate four terms that are often confused: sexual identity and orientation; sexual preferences; sexual fantasies; and sexual behavior. Contrary to common usage, they aren’t always in alignment.\nSexual identity and orientation encompasses one’s sexual and romantic identity, in which thoughts, fantasies, and behaviors work together in concert. It’s the alignment of affectional, romantic, psychological, spiritual, and sexual feelings and desires for those of the same or opposite gender. Sexual orientation doesn’t change over time. One’s sexual behaviors and preferences might change, but like one’s temperament, one’s orientation remains mostly stable. The term also refers to how someone self-identifies, not how others may categorize him or her. Some people self-identify as straight, while others self-identify as gay or lesbian, bisexual, or questioning. It’s important as therapists to ask your clients how they self-identify, regardless of with whom they have sex.\nSexual preferences refer to sexual acts, positions, and erotic scenarios that someone prefers to have while engaging in sexual activity. The term takes into account what individuals like to do and get into sexually, not necessarily with whom they like to do it. Preferences and erotic interests can change over time, as one becomes more open or closed to certain thoughts and behaviors.\nSexual fantasies are any thoughts that one finds arousing. They can encompass anything—sexual positions, romantic encounters, body parts, clothing and shoe fetishes, even rape. Sexual fantasies aren’t necessarily acted out. In fact, in many cases, they aren’t.\nSexual behavior is any behavior intended to pleasure oneself and/or one’s sexual partner. It doesn’t necessarily reflect one’s orientation.

I consider sexual fantasies and erotic interests—whether expressed in healthy or unhealthy ways—as inseparable extensions of our core identity. They’re clues to the past. Often they’re unsuccessful attempts to resolve problems from childhood that are somehow eased in the erotic realm.\nI began to see Paul’s sexual contacts with men as an attempt to resolve the conflictual relationship with his father. As he attempted, unconsciously, to master the abuse and humiliation he received from his father as a child, he placed himself in sexual situations where he was at risk and felt humiliated all over again. With the other man in control, Paul was “helpless.” He was under the spell of the other man, who was intoxicated, just as his father had been.\nPaul soon began to understand that he was “returning to the scene of the crime” for several reasons. First, he realized that he was not only angry at his father, but also “hungry” for the father he’d never had. He’d sought sex with men as a way of finding the nurturance and male acceptance he never received from his father. He tried to talk to his father about all the anger he’d accumulated since his childhood, but his father—still an active drinker—just laughed and called him weak.\nFortunately, he was able to feel my empathy for him and my sorrow for what he’d been through. He allowed me to “father” him in appropriate therapeutic ways. For example, he didn’t have a lot of money, so he couldn’t come more than once weekly, but I thought he needed more frequent sessions. So I allowed him to call me outside the therapy hour on my cell phone if he felt like going out and having sex with a man, so I could help him withstand the urge. He needed to feel that I was there for him when he experienced anxiety and traumatic feelings, and was overwhelmed with what he felt was my sincere interest in being available to him. His calls never lasted more than 15 minutes and were never more frequent than twice weekly for several months. He brought in his journal and left it with me to read, and I didn’t charge him for my time.\nUltimately, Paul was able to hold his mother and father accountable for their negative behavior toward him in childhood. Having had an abusive father and neglectful mother, he came into treatment letting them off the hook and reenacting the trauma by displacing the anger and shame on himself and his fiancée. He needed a safe place to explore his sexual behavior without being labeled gay, bisexual, or even questioning. This wasn’t a case that revolved around whether he was gay, but rather what his original trauma was and how it could be resolved. Had Paul not been heterosexual, his gay identity would have surfaced during treatment.\nComing Out Straight\nTherapists who work with this population have to follow their clients’ leads. The work is as much about education as psychotherapy. It’s crucial to give each man who has sex with men information about homosexuality and the coming-out process, sexual abuse, sexual addiction, family-of-origin issues, and mood disorders that could contribute to the desire to have sex with males. However, as the work evolves, it’s up to the client himself to decide if this is the beginning of the coming-out process, a sign of early sexual abuse, a sexual addiction, or some other form of acting out. It could also just be that once-in-a-while sex with men is something that a man might want, and means nothing more than that.

Wrong. While the belief that sugar causes hyperactivity in children is widespread and perpetuated by the children themselves, it’s a myth, according to Sabiha Kanchwala, MD, general pediatrics specialist at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital.) The popularized Feingold diet, which eliminated food additives, brought sugar under close scrutiny in the 1970s. But some years later in the 1980s, the Feingold diet came under the same scrutiny, and multiple contradicting studies were established. The findings concluded sugar has no influence on children’s behavior.\n“We’re almost 40 years later, and people still think sugars make their kids really active or hyperactive,” Kanchwala says.\nExpectation and perception\nKanchwala says a large part of this myth comes from the power of our own minds. If we go into a situation expecting a certain outcome, we will likely see that outcome. It’s a placebo effect.\n“Even children know the power of their brains. They say, ‘I ate all this candy, I’m never going to go to sleep!’” Kanchwala says. “We know sugar in and of itself is not what’s making your child hyper, but there are a variety of other things leading to their excessive activity.”\nMost often, hyperactivity in children results from poor sleep. Kanchwala recommends following careful sleep hygiene to ensure your child sleeps enough. Turn off electronics well before bedtime, create a sleep conducive environment, follow a bedtime routine (including time), and make sure your child gets anywhere from 10-12 hours a night for school-aged children, and 8-10 hours a night for teenagers. Getting enough exercise during the day also helps children sleep.\n“Adults are more tired and somnolent throughout the day when they’re not getting good sleep; kids can be really hyper,” Kanchwala says. “One of the biggest factors for patient’s hyperactivity is lack of sleep.”\nA chronic condition can also cause hyper behavior, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Kanchwala says these kids’ behavior can look like hyperactivity when it’s not. If you believe your child struggles with a such a condition, speak to your pediatrician about an evaluation right away, particularly for school-aged children.\nOther factors include stress, trauma, or caffeine. Some candies, such as chocolate, contain caffeine and create a supposed ‘sugar rush.’ Caffeine can prevent drowsiness, cause restlessness, increase heart rate, and cause other side effects. It’s possible your child’s behavior matches up with caffeine intake.\nIt’s important to remember that children are children, and what a parent interprets as hyperactivity may be the natural, healthy energy of young life. Delve into the source of your child’s hyperactivity. Consider when and where your child’s hyperactivity blooms, if their hyperactivity corresponds with their sleep, or if another kind of behavioral health issue might play a role.\nSugar’s actual effect\nSugar itself may not make your child hyper, but it does affect your child’s health and future. Kanchwala says processed sugar intake leads to obesity in childhood. This major health problem results in both childhood and adulthood health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, liver disease, and even mental health conditions.\nProcessed sugar often shows up on labels of overall unhealthy foods — fast, processed foods that make easy grab-and-go snacks for a busy household.\n“Unfortunately, foods readily available are going to have added sugars that make it taste better and last longer,” Kanchwala says. “Parents should be mindful of the foods children eat that contain this processed sugar.”\nThe more unprocessed the diet, the healthier for the child, says Kanchwala. She recommends avoiding juice and other sugary snacks such as fruit gummies and replacing them with foods containing naturally occurring sugars.

A total of 107 students participated, and eight boys and one girl (8.4% of the total) categorized as high risk for ADHD according to diagnostic criteria. There were significant differences in the occupations and drinking habits of the respondents' fathers between the normal group and risk group. In a comparison of students' nutrition intake status with daily nutrition intake standards for Koreans, students consumed twice as much protein as the recommended level, whereas their calcium intake was only 60% of the recommended DRI (dietary reference intake). Regarding intake volume of vitamin C, the normal group posted 143.9% of the recommended DRI, whereas the risk group showed only 65.5% of the recommended DRI. In terms of simple sugar intake from snacks, students in the normal group consumed 58.4 g while the risk group consumed 50.2 g. These levels constituted 12.5% of their total daily volume of sugar intake from snacks, which is higher than the 10% standard recommended by the WHO. In conclusion, children who consumed less sugar from fruit snacks or whose vitamin C intake was less than RI was at increased risks for ADHD (P < 0.05). However, no significant association was observed between total volume of simple sugar intake from snacks and ADHD development.\nKeywords: ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), sugar consumption, dietary behavior\nIntroduction\nBalanced nutrition is very important during childhood, which is a period of vigorous growth, increased activity, and development of body functions and social cognitive ability. With rapid economic growth and increased personal income, and especially advances in food processing and manufacturing industries, the proportion of processed foods (e.g. snacks and cakes) in children's dietary life has noticeably increased [1-2]. It has also led to larger physiques of pre-adolescent children.\nRecently, the interest in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during childhood has increased. ADHD is defined as a neurobehavioral developmental disorder characterized by continuous inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness and is especially prevalent in childhood [3-4]. Unlike those showing simple hyperactivity features, children with ADHD have three subtype symptoms: predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, predominantly inattentive, and combined hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive [5-7]. The Conner Abbreviated Teacher Rating Scale (CATRS) is widely used to specifically measure the mental pathology behavior of children with ADHD [8]. The etiology of ADHD involves genetic, dietary, and environmental factors. Especially, dietary factors such as color agents or simple sugar have been determined to increase the risk of ADHD [6,9].\nSimple sugar consumption may cause hyperactivity, given that snacks containing high sugar content cause massive secretion of insulin from the pancreas, resulting in hypoglycemia [9]. This stimulates an increase in epinephrine, leading to activation of nervous reactions and hyperactivity disorder behaviors [9]. In other words, elevated intake of snacks might increase the potential of nutritional imbalance, lower emotional intelligence [10-11], and ADHD [12-14]. A recent study on sugar consumption suggested that higher consumption of sugar is positively correlated with a higher level of hyperactivity and attention deficiency similar to ADHD [1,9,11,15]. However, it is still controversial whether or not there is an association between ADHD and sugar consumption. A study by Wolraich et al. found that diets high in sucrose had no significant effects on behavior and cognitive performance in children [16]. Moreover, in Korea, there are little data on how much simple sugar children obtain from snacks or if higher consumption of simple sugar is associated with ADHD ris\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, there is a substantial body of research indicating that sugar does not cause hyperactivity in children. The belief often stems from the power of suggestion and expectations rather than any direct causative effect of sugar itself. Therefore, sugar is unlikely to be the cause of hyperactivity.\n\n<answer> No </answer>\n\nNo, sugar does not cause hyperactivity in children based on substantial research.",

    "agent_answer": "Based on the persistent nature of the allegations and the public responses, women who supported Trump previously due to his political stance or campaign promises are likely to reconsider voting for him if those factors were primarily influenced by his demeaning remarks towards women. Hence, it seems plausible that despite his insulting remarks, women might still vote for him but with a reduced inclination due to his history of disrespectful and inappropriate behavior.\n\n\n<answer> No </answer>\n\nThis conclusion suggests women would not fully disregard him, but the impact of his behavior might reduce their willingness to support him significantly.",

She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter that this is the first time a major party is picking a woman to be its nominee? Johnny McMahan, 65, a GOP delegate from Arkansas, said he had no problem with a woman being president but some of his friends felt differently. “They say women are too emotional to be president,” McMahan said. Though assailing the opposing candidate is standard fare at political conventions, this year the attacks have transcended policy positions and become intimately personal. The relentless spotlight on an opponent’s supposed criminality is another departure. Republicans maintain Clinton broke the law by sending classified information on her private email server. Trump’s campaign has worked to sow distrust by using vague insinuations against Clinton that are hard to prove or disprove. On Wednesday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort mused that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had “probably” given special information to Bill Clinton that helped his wife avoid criminal charges, during a brief airport meeting that Lynch has acknowledged was a mistake. He said the “Lock her up!” chant punctuating speeches at the conventions “probably reflects the attitude of a lot of people in America.” “They don’t understand why justice wasn’t done,” he said.

Donate now By — Josh Lederman, Associated Press Josh Lederman, Associated Press By — Erica Werner, Associated Press Erica Werner, Associated Press) CLEVELAND — Liar. Garbage. Lock her up. Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean tow\nDoc 4(Title: co.

She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter that this is the first time a major party is picking a woman to be its nominee? Johnny McMahan, 65, a GOP delegate from Arkansas, said he had no problem with a woman being president but some of his friends felt differently. “They say women are too emotional to be president,” McMahan said. Though assailing the opposing candidate is standard fare at political conventions, this year the attacks have transcended policy positions and become intimately personal. The relentless spotlight on an opponent’s supposed criminality is another departure. Republicans maintain Clinton broke the law by sending classified information on her private email server. Trump’s campaign has worked to sow distrust by using vague insinuations against Clinton that are hard to prove or disprove. On Wednesday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort mused that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had “probably” given special information to Bill Clinton that helped his wife avoid criminal charges, during a brief airport meeting that Lynch has acknowledged was a mistake. He said the “Lock her up!” chant punctuating speeches at the conventions “probably reflects the attitude of a lot of people in America.” “They don’t understand why justice wasn’t done,” he said.

Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean tow\nDoc 4(Title: co.

GOP Election Denialism Is Far Worse.) \ntwo‐​and‐​a‐​half years of Trump’s presidency, Clinton had kept a low profile and refrained from attacking Trump’s legitimacy. It seems that the most the GOP list‐​makers could find from before 2019 was that in [September 2017](https://www.npr.org/2017/09/18/551217204/hillary-clinton-says-shes-optimistic-about-our-country-but-i-am-not-naive), when repeatedly pressed by National Public Radio host Terry Gross, Clinton said she would not absolutely rule out questioning the legitimacy of the election if more information about Russian interference came out. She also stressed that there were no means to legally challenge it: “There are scholars, academics, who have arguments that it would be \\[legal\\], but I don’t think they’re on strong ground.… I just don’t think we have a mechanism.”\n\nLet’s not forget that a little less than a year earlier, in the immediate aftermath of the election, Hillary Clinton gave a [gracious concession speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khK9fIgoNjQ) on November 9, 2016 when it became clear that she had lost to Trump.\n\nIt’s true that some other high‐​level Democrats were more defiant. About [seventy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/16/more-than-30-democratic-lawmakers-now-skipping-trumps-inauguration/)—including the late Rep. John Lewis of Georgia and Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, refused to attend the inauguration in January 2017, some explicitly citing Trump’s alleged illegitimacy. And yes, some Democratic House members objected to the certification of their states’ votes. How many? [A total of _seven_.](https://www.congress.gov/115/crec/2017/01/06/CREC-2017-01-06-pt1-PgH185-8.pdf) Because no Democratic senators joined them, the objections were not even formally considered. By contrast, in January 2021, [139 Republican House members](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html) and eight Republican senators objected to the certification of Biden’s win. That’s 139 vs. 7 in the House and 8 vs. 0 in the Senate.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention massive Republican efforts at the state level, supported by [19 Republican attorneys general](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/529614-18-states-join-texas-case-seeing-to-overturn-biden-win/) and coordinated with Trump’s own legal team—and with Trump’s own active and aggressive participation—to invalidate the results of the vote in several swing states in an attempt to throw the Electoral College to Trump. In several states that Biden won, this effort included fraudulent electors sending to Washington phony certificates depicting Trump as the winner. Let’s leave aside for now the question of whether this effort could have worked if a few officials in key posts had caved to the pressure. The point is that it was a dogged, multipronged effort by people who absolutely wanted it to succeed.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention the events of January 6th, when a mob of Trump supporters—egged on by Trump himself to “[Fight like hell](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/trump-speech-riot.html)”—invaded the Capitol in a last‐​ditch attempt to stop the certification of Biden’s victory. (No, the violent [anti‐​Trump protests](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/19/politics/trump-inauguration-protests-womens-march) in Washington on Inauguration Day in 2017 are not remotely comparable; they were not intended to reverse the election results, and neither Clinton nor any other prominent Democratic politician cheered them on.)\n\nIn other words, comparing “election results denial” in 2016 and 2020 is not just comparing apples and oranges, it’s more like comparing a tricycle to an 18‐​wheeler.\n\n**II. The 2000 Presidential Race**\n\nThe finger‐​pointing at the 2000 election is equally specious. First of all, there actually was a hotly contested election that year and a controversial Supreme Court ruling to stop a recount. Ye\nDoc 2(Title: DONALD J. TRUMP, PETITIONER v. CYRUS R. VANCE, JR., IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK, ET AL., RESPONDENTS) \nthose particular privileges is not needed, may be\n\nappropriate.\n\n_Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_,\n\n558 U.S. 310 (2010)_,_ is apposite, too, in that its\n\nprotection against oppressive government reminds\n\nus that the President should not be an unpunished\n\noppressor and criminal himself.\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien has lessons not only\n\nre national injunctions (as a Court Member may\n\nhave noted), but also re the danger of letting the\n\nPresident cloak himself in invisibility and arrogance,\n\nif he insists he is above criminal proceedings.\n\nA Biblical view, seeing King David repenting\n\nafter Nathan revealed his sin to him, and the Lord\n\ntelling Ezekiel to warn people of their sins, is\n\nrelevant here.\n\nGiven the current Chief Executive’s proclivities\n\ntowards unlimited power, the current moment is a\n\nstrikingly poor time to further allow him—or all\n\nfuture Presidents—further license.\n\n4\n\nFinally, Shakespeare’s _Coriolanus_ illustrates the\n\nevil and chaos that happen when leaders betray\n\ntheir country’s best interests, and lack of legal\n\nprocess to try those leaders properly makes things\n\neven worse. The Court should take heed.\n\n**ARGUMENT**\n\n**I. NOTES ON CHANGE IN AMICUS PRACTICE:**\n\n**OR, THE SOFT STATISM OF REDUCING**\n\n**AMICUS BRIEFS TO 8000 WORDS**\n\nFirst off, a quick procedural comment or two:\n\nAmicus notes he has had, “for whatever reason”, a\n\nhiatus of some years since writing the Court. He also\n\nnotes that mysteriously, the rules have changed so\n\nthat the average amicus or amica—one who is not\n\npart of a state entity—is now limited to 8000 words,\n\ninstead of the 9000 he/she used to have. Amicus\n\nwonders if this new rationing of core legal and/or\n\npolitical (since law and politics overlap) speech is a\n\ngood idea.\n\n_Inter alia_, state entities, being large, established,\n\nand powerful, have plenty of ways of making\n\nthemselves heard. By contrast, it is, say, the small-\n\ntime country lawyer, writing her first and only brief\n\nto this Court, who may need all 9000 words to make\n\nimportant and complicated arguments to the Court.\n\nMaybe the government amici, not the “little people”,\n\nso to speak, should have been restricted to 8000\n\nwords, Thus, there is arguably a sort of statism, even\n\nif soft statism, in the new 8000-word wall. Perhaps\n\nthe Court can revisit its unnecessary speech-\n\nrationing at some point.\n\n5\n\n(Amicus is not “resentful” of the 8000-word limit;\n\nif he were, then, like Achilles sulking in his tent,\n\nHomer, _The Iliad_, he might have refused even to\n\nwrite this brief, or any amicus brief. But sulking\n\nmay achieve little, so here is Amicus, with his brief.)\n\n…True, some amici may be able to shoehorn their\n\nentire brief into, say, the length of a 17-syllable\n\n_haiku_. This is not always going to happen, though.\n\nEnough on that point for now: speaking of\n\nstatism, far more important forms of statism exist to\n\nbe criticized here, such as the deep state of\n\ncorruption created at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if\n\nthe President is deemed immune to criminal\n\nproceedings during his tenure in office.\n\n**II.

Currently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the popular vote nationally. For example, in this last election a Republican elector from Ohio would have to vote for Hillary Clinton because she won the popular vote nationally. A provision of the law is that it only takes effect when states comprising 270 electoral votes – a majority – all pass it. That’s nowhere close yet. Twelve states have passed this law. Connecticut had it before the legislature three or four years ago and it did not work its way through, but there is support for it here.\nShould there be electors in some states that change their vote on Dec. 19 and go against how they are supposed to vote, and the election results change, how could that be dealt with?\nBefore the Republican convention there was a lot of discussion of delegates not voting for Donald Trump. That didn’t happen. I don’t think it’s going to happen this time. If it did, it would be the kind of issue that makes your head explode. There would be an affirmation of the popular vote but it would be people voting not according to the way the people in their state dictated that they should vote. As noted, there have been faithless electors over time, but it’s never shaped the outcome of an election. This time around it would be, as Donald Trump would say, huge.\nWe advocate to other nations as they are moving toward democracy to let the people decide their elected representatives, but the people don’t really decide here if the winner of the popular vote doesn’t win. How do we as nation reconcile that?\nMost democracies are parliamentary systems, not a three branch system such as we have. It has not been uncommon in Great Britain, for example, for one party to get more aggregate votes for its parliamentary delegation, yet the other party gets more seats. We’re not unique in that regard. Secondly, we are a federal system, and the Electoral College is one of the things that makes federalism real. If you think federalism is a good thing, then you want to keep the Electoral College. Concurrent with the existence of the Electoral College, even with several occasions when the winner of the popular vote hasn’t won the election, advocates of the present system might say that the United States emerged as the most powerful and at times richest country in history. We defeated communism and fascism, we had some great political leaders and some duds as well. The Electoral College has not destroyed American democracy.\nYou served as a Connecticut elector in 2012. What was that experience like for you?\nIt was really just one of the rituals of American democracy. One of the electors was criticized in the early days of the republic because he had been chosen to vote as a Federalist but voted for the Jeffersonians. One of his critics said, “We employed you not to think, but to act.” I acted and cast my ballot, placing it in a box that was carved out of the original Charter Oak Tree used every four years only for this purpose. The ballots were already marked for Obama and Biden. There was not much discretion there. It seemed to me it was a symbolic way of affirming the ongoing nature of the Presidency. I didn’t have to think – just to act.\nDoc 4(Title:  day that President Trump’s so-called Commission on Election Integrity sent letters to all 50 states demanding intrusive and highly sensitive personal data about all registered voters.)

GOP Election Denialism Is Far Worse.) \nWhen Democrats voice dismay at MAGA Republicans’ belief that Donald Trump got cheated out of victory in the 2020 election, a common response goes: “[Well, Democrats do it too!](https://www.journal-news.net/election-denial-has-long-been-a-democrat-talking-point/article_3218f9e5-8926-517a-b1d0-fb5ebfb83d30.html)” _But Hillary!_ _But Stacey Abrams!_ _But Al Gore!_ _But Jimmy Carter!_ Anti‐​anti‐​Trump types are willing to concede that Trump’s claims about the 2020 “steal” were baseless, but they insist that the problem exists on Both SidesTM, and that it’s rank partisanship—not to mention hypocrisy—to claim that the Trumpified GOP’s election denialism should be uniquely disqualifying.\n\nThere are many instances in which a nuanced view of an issue gets unfairly slammed as “bothsidesism.” This isn’t one of them.\n\nHave politicians (and other public figures) from both parties made ill‐​advised, and sometimes entirely spurious, statements questioning the legitimacy of elections that favored the other party? Yes, they have, and it’s a bad and toxic habit. In particular, there are good reasons to be harshly critical of some Democratic claims casting aspersions on election integrity in the United States, and the Democratic party needs to so some serious soul‐​searching on the subject. But the GOP’s post‐​2020 election denialism is in an entirely different league. It is vastly more toxic. And it is uniquely dangerous.\n\nWhile Republican activists have compiled a long list of “[Democrats denying election results](https://gop.com/research/over-150-examples-of-democrats-denying-election-results-rsr/)” (there’s even a [12‐​minute supercut](https://gop.com/video/12-minutes-of-democrats-denying-election-results/) of clips put out by the Republican National Committee), they revolve mainly around three issues: the 2016 election, the 2000 election, and the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia which Stacey Abrams lost to Brian Kemp. Let’s deal with each of these in turn.\n\n**I. The 2016 Presidential Race**\n\nThe Republicans’ favorite smoking guns relating to the 2016 election are a couple of video clips of Hillary Clinton expressing the view that the election was “[stolen](https://youtu.be/77i_pC3lp04)” from her or that Trump was an “[illegitimate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-trump-is-an-illegitimate-president/2019/09/26/29195d5a-e099-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html)” president.\n\nThe first thing to note is that Clinton’s comments were made in 2019, nearly three years after the 2016 election. The “stolen election” remark is from May 2019, two weeks after the publication of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s [report](https://www.thebulwark.com/read-the-mueller-report-here/), which stated that while there was no evidence of active conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, there had in fact been [a Russian conspiracy](https://www.thebulwark.com/no-russiagate-wasnt-the-hoax-that-team-trump-claims-it-was/) intended to help elect Trump. And Clinton’s remark about Trump being an “illegitimate” president came in September 2019, in the midst of the [Trump‐​Ukraine scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/ukraine-trump.html) that soon led to Trump’s (first) impeachment, for trying to use military aid to Ukraine to leverage demands for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to provide information that would damage then‐​Democratic candidate Joe Biden and cast doubt on Russian election interference in 2016. By then, Trump was already widely seen as an illegitimate president by his critics.\n\nBy contrast, during the first two‐​and‐​a‐​half years of Trump’s presidency, Clinton had kept a low profile and refrained from attacking Trump’s legitimacy. It seems that the most the GOP list‐​makers could find from before 2019 was that in [September 2017](https://www.npr.org/2017/09/18/551217204/hillary-clinton-says-shes-optim\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that Hillary Clinton did express some skepticism about Trump's legitimacy in later years, but it appears that Donald Trump did not publicly propose specific methods on how to stop future elections from being \"rigged\" in the sense described, focusing more on broader partisan attacks rather than constructive solutions.

The survey in Ukraine also finds a clearly negative reaction to the role Russia is playing in the country. By contrast, the poll in Russia reveals a public that firmly backs Vladimir Putin and Crimea’s secession from Ukraine.) Among Ukrainians, 77% say Ukraine should remain united, compared with 14% who think regions should be permitted to secede if they so desire. In Ukraine’s west, which includes the central region around Kyiv (Kiev), as well as portions of the country that border Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, more than nine-in-ten (93%) think their nation should remain unified. A smaller majority (70%) in the country’s east – which includes areas along the Black Sea and the border with Russia – also prefer unity. Only in the breakaway territory of Crimea do more than half (54%) voice support for the right to secede.\nThe survey in Ukraine finds that ethnic Ukrainians and ethnic Russians largely have favorable views of one another. Nonetheless, there are stark regional divides, especially when it comes to the issues of official languages and governance. In western Ukraine, nearly two-thirds (66%) think only the Ukrainian language should have legal standing. By contrast, roughly seven-in-ten in eastern Ukraine (73%) say both Russian and Ukrainian should be official state languages. This view is especially widespread among the region’s Russian-only speakers1: 86% in this group think the Russian and Ukrainian languages should share official status. Meanwhile, in Crimea nearly three-quarters (74%) say both languages should have legal status on the Crimean peninsula.\nLack of confidence in the central government is pronounced. Not including Crimea, fewer than half of Ukrainians (41%) say the current government in Kyiv is having a good influence on the way things are going in the country. Similar to views on official state languages, sharp regional divides are evident: six-in-ten in the country’s west rate Kyiv’s influence favorably, compared with only about a quarter in eastern Ukraine (24%) who share this assessment.\nUkrainians are also divided in their hopes for the upcoming presidential elections. About six-in-ten in the country’s west (59%) expect the May 25th vote to be free and fair, compared with fewer than three-in-ten who share this view in eastern Ukraine (27%) and Crimea (20%).\nWhoever leads Ukraine next will face a steep challenge when it comes to repairing the public’s faith in the central government. Although half in western Ukraine say they trust Kyiv to guarantee personal freedoms, far fewer in eastern Ukraine (21%) and Crimea (7%) agree. Moreover, majorities in both the country’s east (71%) and west (55%) point to the nation’s lack of political leadership as a very big problem.\nThese are the principal findings from the latest survey in Ukraine by the Pew Research Center. Based on face-to-face interviews between April 5-23, with 1,659 randomly selected adults from across the country, the poll finds that along with questions about the country’s leadership, Ukrainians are far from satisfied with the involvement of foreign powers to date. The European Union fairs best in the eyes of Ukrainians, with a 45%-plurality describing its influence in Ukraine as good. Meanwhile, assessments of the U.S. impact on Ukraine are split: 38% positive, 38% negative.\nRussia is viewed with the greatest suspicion. Three times as many Ukrainians say Russia is having a bad influence on their country as say it is having a good impact (67% vs. 22%).

Russian-Ukrainian relations are seriously affected by such controversies. The range of conflict areas in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine is rather large -- the two nations have differences on ethnic, political, economic, territorial, and military issues. It has been especially difficult for many Russians to accept the secession of Ukraine. In imperial Russia, Ukraine was considered a sub-division of a larger Russia. The Bolsheviks rejected this idea and, through the Soviet era, officially acknowledged the existence of Ukraine as a separate East Slavic nation. At present, Russia has been trying to gain its role as the \"elder brother\" of Ukraine, while Ukraine, having gained formal political independence, wishes to establish its new identity. The search by both Russians and Ukrainians for their identities, and both Kiev's and Moscow's wishes to make as many political, economic, and military gains as possible from the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union, are the main characteristic features of the relationship between the two states. Due to the large set of conflict areas in bilateral relations, and having domestic instability and a lack of democratic institutions in both states, the Russian-Ukrainian disputes are likely to be long-term ones.\nIn 1992-93 the two most controversial issues in the Russian-Ukrainian relationship were the disputes over Ukraine's denuclearization, and provisions to Ukraine from Russia. Since early 1994, the division of the Black Sea Fleet and developments in Crimea have become the dominant (or, at least, very significant) aspects in Russian-Ukrainian relations. The Crimean peninsula has become an arena for the duel between Kiev and Moscow on political, economic, military, and territorial disputes. The upcoming Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between Russia and Ukraine was supposed to settle these disputes. However, it was decided by negotiating delegations led by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Evgyeniy Marchuk in October 1994 to give this treaty a status of a \"frame-work,\" leaving disputes over Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet unsettled. In this paper, I discuss the role and significance of the disputes over the Black Sea Fleet and Crimea within the context of Russian-Ukrainian relations.\nRussian-Ukrainian Relations: A General Outlook\nUkraine's Independence\nIn Kiev in November 1990, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk signed a friendship treaty in which Russia and Ukraine recognized each other as sovereign states. It was a tactical alliance between two provincial leaders, who were demonstrating their opposition to Gorbachev's rule and fostering the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In a referendum on December 1, 1991, more than 90 percent of the Ukrainian population voted for independence, and within a week, Yeltsin recognized Ukraine's independence unconditionally.\nSince \nDoc 5(Title:  Crimea's independence. Independence alone will allow us to solve our economic problems. The results of the presidential elections confirmed the population's orientation to economic, cultural and other links with Russia, and to reunion with Russia....The Black Sea Fleet must be indivisible, belong to Russia and be based in Sevastopol which is an inalienable part of the Republic of Crimea.27) On February 15, 1994, Meshkov sent the order addressed to the commander of Ukraine's Navy, arguing that citizens of Crimea should undergo military service on the territory of the Republic of Crimea. In fact, this could be viewed as the beginning of raising independent armed forces in Crimea and inspiring secessionist aspirations. Representatives of Ukraine's Navy stated that they are subordinated to Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and to Kravchuk.28 Also, Meshkov's statement about making the Russian ruble legal tender in Crimea was condemned by Kiev's officials as \"ill-conceived and premature.\" According to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, \"the budgetary relations (with Crimea) will remain largely unchanged, ...and the Russian ruble will never be legal in Ukraine.\"29\nAnother area of controversy is Meshkov's intention to call for a referendum on. Crimea's independence. On March 10, 1994, Meshkov issued an order authorizing the so-called \"public poll\" on independence of Crimea. Kravchuk immediately abandoned the order and declared it invalid. In official statements, Kiev leaders argue that the idea of secession of Crimea runs counter to the Trilateral Statement of January 14, 1994, and to the provisions of the final act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. According to Vladimir Kryzhanovsky, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia, the idea of incorporation of Crimea into Russia through a referendum is the same as \"the incorporation of Russia's Kurile Islands into Japan on the basis of a referendum by the Kurile population.\"30\nRestoration of the Constitution of May 5, 1992\nThe most obvious attempt to explore the ground as to Kiev's and Moscow's approach to independence of Crimea was made by Crimean leadership in May 1994. The idea to revise the Crimean Constitution was used as a touchstone to clarify the positions of both Kiev and Moscow. As stated previously, the provisions on Crimea's independence, dual Crimean-Russian citizenship, and independent military units of Crimea were excluded from the original text of the constitution. In mid-May 1994, Yuri Meshlcov suggested the Crimean parliament should restore these provisions. In response, President Kravchuk warned that \"(Kiev) will act decisively and consistently, proceeding from the fact that Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine.\"31 Despite this warning, on May 20, 1994, the parliament of Crimea overwhelmingly voted for the restoration of the text of the Constitution of May 6, 1992. Also, Meshkov refused to recognize President Kravchuk's decree which transferred the Crimean Republic's Ministry of Interior over to the Interior Ministry of Ukraine. The heads of the independent Crimean Interior Ministry, Security Service, and Ministry of Justice were elected.32 These developments caused a stormy reaction in Kiev. President Kravchuk and the Verhovna Rada immediately abandoned the May 20, 1994 resolution and called the Crimean parliament to bring its legislation into compliance with Ukrainian legislative acts. In his rather decisive statement, the former Ukrainian Defense Minister Radetsky pointed out that \"Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine, and violators of the territorial integrity of Ukraine will be severely punished .... We will never give up Crimea.\"33 Former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko, in an address to the UN Security Council and other international organizations, stated: \"Ukraine reserves the right, should the tension in the region escalate, to take all measures necessary for preserving the integrity of its territory. \"34\nSurprisingly, Russia was in\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems Crimea's status is disputed.

Due to the large set of conflict areas in bilateral relations, and having domestic instability and a lack of democratic institutions in both states, the Russian-Ukrainian disputes are likely to be long-term ones.\nIn 1992-93 the two most controversial issues in the Russian-Ukrainian relationship were the disputes over Ukraine's denuclearization, and provisions to Ukraine from Russia. Since early 1994, the division of the Black Sea Fleet and developments in Crimea have become the dominant (or, at least, very significant) aspects in Russian-Ukrainian relations. The Crimean peninsula has become an arena for the duel between Kiev and Moscow on political, economic, military, and territorial disputes. The upcoming Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between Russia and Ukraine was supposed to settle these disputes. However, it was decided by negotiating delegations led by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Evgyeniy Marchuk in October 1994 to give this treaty a status of a \"frame-work,\" leaving disputes over Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet unsettled. In this paper, I discuss the role and significance of the disputes over the Black Sea Fleet and Crimea within the context of Russian-Ukrainian relations.\nRussian-Ukrainian Relations: A General Outlook\nUkraine's Independence\nIn Kiev in November 1990, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk signed a friendship treaty in which Russia and Ukraine recognized each other as sovereign states. It was a tactical alliance between two provincial leaders, who were demonstrating their opposition to Gorbachev's rule and fostering the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In a referendum on December 1, 1991, more than 90 percent of the Ukrainian population voted for independence, and within a week, Yeltsin recognized Ukraine's independence unconditionally.\nSince \nDoc 4(Title:  Crimea's independence. Independence alone will allow us to solve our economic problems. The results of the presidential elections confirmed the population's orientation to economic, cultural and other links with Russia, and to reunion with Russia....The Black Sea Fleet must be indivisible, belong to Russia and be based in Sevastopol which is an inalienable part of the Republic of Crimea.27) On February 15, 1994, Meshkov sent the order addressed to the commander of Ukraine's Navy, arguing that citizens of Crimea should undergo military service on the territory of the Republic of Crimea. In fact, this could be viewed as the beginning of raising independent armed forces in Crimea and inspiring secessionist aspirations. Representatives of Ukraine's Navy stated that they are subordinated to Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and to Kravchuk.28 Also, Meshkov's statement about making the Russian ruble legal tender in Crimea was condemned by Kiev's officials as \"ill-conceived and premature.\" According to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, \"the budgetary relations (with Crimea) will remain largely unchanged, ...and the Russian ruble will never be legal in Ukraine.\"29\nAnother area of controversy is Meshkov's intention to call for a referendum on. Crimea's independence. On March 10, 1994, Meshkov issued an order authorizing the so-called \"public poll\" on independence of Crimea. Kravchuk immediately abandoned the order and declared it invalid. In official statements, Kiev leaders argue that the idea of secession of Crimea runs counter to the Trilateral Statement of January 14, 1994, and to the provisions of the final act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. According to Vladimir Kryzhanovsky, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia, the idea of incorporation of Crimea into Russia through a referendum is the same as \"the incorporation of Russia's Kurile Islands into Japan on the basis of a referendum by the Kurile population.\"30\nRestoration of the Constitution of May 5, 1992\nThe most obvious attempt to explore the ground as to Kiev's and Moscow's approach to independence of Crimea was made by Crimean leadership in May 1994. The idea to revise the Crimean Constitution was used as a touchstone to clarify the positions of both Kiev and Moscow. As stated previously, the provisions on Crimea's independence, dual Crimean-Russian citizenship, and independent military units of Crimea were excluded from the original text of the constitution. In mid-May 1994, Yuri Meshlcov suggested the Crimean parliament should restore these provisions. In response, President Kravchuk warned that \"(Kiev) will act decisively and consistently, proceeding from the fact that Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine.\"31 Despite this warning, on May 20, 1994, the parliament of Crimea overwhelmingly voted for the restoration of the text of the Constitution of May 6, 1992. Also, Meshkov refused to recognize President Kravchuk's decree which transferred the Crimean Republic's Ministry of Interior over to the Interior Ministry of Ukraine. The heads of the independent Crimean Interior Ministry, Security Service, and Ministry of Justice were elected.32 These developments caused a stormy reaction in Kiev. President Kravchuk and the Verhovna Rada immediately abandoned the May 20, 1994 resolution and called the Crimean parliament to bring its legislation into compliance with Ukrainian legislative acts. In his rather decisive statement, the former Ukrainian Defense Minister Radetsky pointed out that \"Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine, and violators of the territorial integrity of Ukraine will be severely punished .... We will never give up Crimea.\"33 Former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko, in an address to the UN Security Council and other international organizations, stated: \"Ukraine reserves the right, should the tension in the region escalate, to take all measures necessary for preserving the integrity of its territory. \"34\nSurprisingly, Russia was in\nDoc 5(Title: sals for autonomy. In September 1991, the Crimean parliament declared its sovereignty albeit as a constituent part of Ukraine. A slight majority (54 percent) of voters in Crimea supported Ukrainian independence in the December 1991 referendum.24) On May 5, 1992 the Crimean parliament declared its independence, and on May 6, 1992, it voted for a Constitution establishing the independence and providing dual citizenship with Russia for the Crimean population. Also, the Crimean parliament passed a resolution calling for a referendum on independence from Ukraine. The Verhovna Rada of Ukraine responded by declaring the independence declaration invalid. It instructed the Crimean parliament to reverse its decision and review some provisions of the Constitution, or face direct presidential rule from Kiev. At the same time, the Republican Movement of Crimea, a Russian-inspired organization, was very active in gathering the requisite number of signatures needed to hold a Crimean referendum on independence from Ukraine. The Kiev leadership, including chairman of the Crimean parliament Nikolay Bagrov, did their best to prevent escalation of the conflict. Their efforts resulted in a compromise between Kiev and Simferopol. Kiev made certain concessions, adopting the Act on Division of Powers Between Authorities of Ukraine and Republic of Crimea.\nThe Act has granted Crimea wide-ranging powers to determine its own foreign economic relations, as well as social and economic policies. It also proclaimed the peninsula an autonomous integral part of Ukraine, and stated that the territory can not be transferred to another state without the consent of both the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments. For its part, the Crimean parliament abandoned its claims for complete independence and dual citizenship. The revised Constitution of Crimea was adopted on September 25, 1992.\nThe dispute between Kiev and Simferppol was an encouraging signal for Russian officials, who were irritated by Ukraine's independence and its consequences, particularly Ukraine's stance on the division of the Black Sea Fleet. In January 1992, Vladimir Lukin, then chairman of the Russian parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, suggested that in order to pressure Ukraine to give up its claim to the Black Sea Fleet, Russia should question Ukrainian control over Crimea.25 This statement was followed by a resolution of the Russian Parliament to investigate the circumstances of Crimea's transfer from Russia to Ukraine in 1954. Finally, the Russian Parliament passed a resolution in May 1992 declaring the 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine illegal. In February 1993, the former Russian Vice-President Rutskoi stated that the International Court of Justice should decide whether Crimea belongs to Russia or Ukraine. This suggestion was supported by Russia's Ambassador to Ukraine, Leonid Smolyakov, who commented at a press conference in early 1993 that Russia had received 20,000 requests for Russian citizenship from Crimeans and that if Crimea should vote to become independent, the Russian government would support the move.26\nThe Era of Meshkov\nThe Strive For \"Crimea's Independence\" -- The Initial Stage\nIn early 1994, Crimea elected Yuri Meshkov as President. Meshkov, an ethnic Russian and former K.G.B. border guard, won overwhelming support from fellow ethnic Russians in a campaign managed by a reputed covert operative from Moscow. Meshkov's pro-Russian position and claims for Crimea's independence had complicated relations between Kiev and Simferopol, and between Kiev and Moscow. The first Crimean president expressed his views to reporters in mid-February 1994 as follows:\nThe main aspect of my policy is Crimea's independence. Independence alone will allow us to solve our economic problems. The results of the presidential elections confirmed the population's orientation to economic, cultural and other links with Russia, and to reunion with Russia....The Black Sea Fleet must be indivisible, belong t\n</information>\n\n\n</think>\n\nBased on the information provided, there is no clear international consensus on whether Crimea is part of Russia or Ukraine.

Corporate entities with no natural limits and endless resources can wage a long-term, sustained attack across policymaking pressure points. For example, if a law is passed that corporate interests oppose, relentless industry pressure can be brought to bear on the agencies charged with enforcing that legislation. Again, in his book, Sen. Whitehouse describes “heavy lawyering of the rulemaking and enforcement processes, often as simple brute pressure to cause delay and cost” on the part of corporate interests. Furthermore, any final rule may be challenged in [courts](https://americanprogress.org/issues/courts/reports/2017/03/13/427905/trumps-supreme-court-nominee-puts-rights-corporations-individuals/) that are increasingly friendly to corporate forces at the expense of people.\n\nIn the short time that President Donald Trump has been in office, the revolving door between industry and the federal agencies regulating them is back in full swing thanks to the administration loosening restrictions on lobbyists taking posts at agencies they previously sought to influence on behalf corporate clients. The independent nonprofit newsroom [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-hundreds-of-officials-trump-has-quietly-installed-across-government) discovered dozens of federally registered lobbyists who were among the first Trump appointees to take positions in federal agencies. For example, lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry and health insurance companies are now in key posts at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; a lobbyist for the construction industry who fought wage and worker safety standards now works for the U.S. Department of Labor; a lobbyist for the extractive resources industry is now at the U.S. Department of Energy; and a for-profit college lobbyist who sought to weaken protections for students worked at the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nIn the Trump administration, as noted by Eric Lipton at _The_ _New York Times_, we continue to see “the [merging](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/us/politics/carl-icahn-trump-adviser-red-flags-ethics.html) of private business interest with government affairs.” In just one example, billionaire investor Carl Icahn has been named “special adviser to the president,” but because he is not officially a government employee, he is not subject to the same conflict of interest divestment requirements. As a consequence, Icahn maintains his majority holdings in an oil refinery while zealously advocating for a rule change that would have saved his refinery more than $200 million the previous year. We have reached an apotheosis of concentrated wealth running government for their interests—Trump’s [cabinet](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/310566-trumps-cabinet-picks-have-more-money-than-third-of-american) has more wealth than one-third of American households, and [Icahn](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/us/politics/carl-icahn-trump-adviser-red-flags-ethics.html) is wealthier than all of them combined.\n\n[_Captured_](http://thenewpress.com/books/captured)_: The Corporate Infiltration of American Democracy_ tells hard truths about the central threat posed by the rule of the rich—plutocracy—and how it is overwhelming American democracy. Sen. Whitehouse writes, “Corporate money is calling the tune in Congress; Congress is unwilling or unable to stand up to corporate power (indeed, Congress is often its agent).” These are truths that must be faced to be fixed.\n\nOur democratic society\nDoc 2(Title: Lobbying and influence) \n![Image 1](https://www.oecd.org/media/oecdorg/directorates/directorateforpublicgovernance/2024/lobbying-birds-300x237.JPG)\n\nA wide range of stakeholders should have a fair and equitable opportunity to contribute to public decision-making, allowing policymakers to decide on the best course of action on any given policy issue.\n\nPublic decision-making however may at times only consider the interests of a few, and undue influence can also be exercised without the direct involvement or knowledge of public decision makers or citizens. These challenges increase in today’s environment of information overload, with new mechanisms and channels of influence, such as social media and artificial intelligence tools, and lobbying and influence by foreign actors, including foreign governments and their related entities or individuals.\n\nLobbying and influence activities that seek to manipulate and deceive decision makers or the broader public, skew democratic processes in favour of narrow interest groups, or intentionally harm the collective interest of societies, can exacerbate economic and social inequalities, bias the outcome of an election, or even lead to deadly policy outcomes.\n\n**An ambitious, state-of-the art standard to strengthen transparency and integrity in lobbying and influence**\n\nThe 2024 OECD Recommendation on Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying and Influence provides concrete guidance for governments on ensuring lobbying and influence activities support public decision-making while safeguarding integrity, transparency and equity in public decision-making processes.\n\n**  \nConcretely, the Recommendation:**\n\n*   Covers all actors involved in lobbying and influence activities, including traditional lobbyists, as well as other actors, like businesses, civil society organisations, think tanks, lobbying firms or law firms representing third-party clients, business and trade associations, trade unions, and the natural persons who are mandated to represent these interests, whether or not they receive compensation for their activities.\n*   Encompasses the broad toolbox of influence activities that lobbying and influence actors use to engage in public decision-making processes and shape policy discourses. This includes, for example, activities to shape public opinion and policy debates through communications campaigns or influencing journalists, as well as providing contributions to political parties and candidates.\n*   Addresses the risks of interference by foreign powers in democratic processes through covert and deceptive lobbying and influence practices, by recommending the disclosure of all lobbying and influence activities conducted by any lobbying and influence actor on behalf of foreign state interests, including foreign governments, foreign political parties, or foreign state-owned and controlled entities. The principles also encourage governments to better account for these risks in their pre/post-public employment regulations.\n*   Provides for transparency and integrity rules for all those who are hired to provide advice or consultancy services to the government, for example individual experts or private consultancy firms, to limit the risks of undue influence and conflicts of interest.\n*   Provides a framework to support businesses and other influence actors in conducting their lobbying and influence activities in a responsible manner, including ensuring that these activities align with their public commitments on broader environmental, social and governance goals.\nDoc 3(Title: Corporate Capture Threatens Democratic Government) \nfirst federal ban](http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a1907tillmanact) on corporate political contributions. But now America’s rules for using money in politics are out of date, and our system of government is out of balance. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has turned its back on reasonable limits for how concentrated wealth can be used to shape government and public choices. In 2010, _Citizens United_ allowed corporate money to be used to support or attack candidates and influence American elections. Previously, in a case overruled by _Citizens United_, the Court [upheld](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/494/652.html) corporate political spending rules, decrying “the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” In his book, Sen. Whitehouse calls out the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, which has “obediently repaid the corporate powers by changing the basic operating systems of our democracy in ways that consistently give big corporate powers even more power in our process of government, rewiring our democracy to corporate advantage.”\n\nCorporate interests can vastly outspend labor or public interest groups on elections. For example, in 2014, business interests spent [$1.1 billion](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2016-04-06/corporate-money-is-playing-a-shadowy-role-in-2016-politics) on state candidates and committees compared to the $215 million that labor groups spent. That same year, business political action committees, or PACs, [spent](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php?cycle=2014) nearly $380 million in federal elections, while labor union PACs gave close to $60 million. In 2016, it is estimated that $1 out of every $8 that went to super PACs came from corporate sources. Super PACs—which didn’t exist before 2010—raised almost $1.8 billion for the 2016 elections. Recently developed dark money channels have exploded, and more than [$800 million dollars](https://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money/basics) of political spending with no disclosure of donors has occurred since 2010. This denies voters information and blocks accountability by hiding the identity of political spenders who want to push their agendas and points of view without leaving fingerprints. Dark money has led to an increase in negative campaigning and deceptive statements in political advertisements, feeding the politics of destruction.\n\nMoreover, the anti-democratic influence of money in politics doesn’t end on election day. The dominance of corporations and business interests exists not just in election spending but also in lobbying elected officials and decision-makers. In 2012, an important study of political influence, [_Unheavenly Chorus_](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9685.html), looked at organized-interest activity aimed at influencing policymaking in Washington, D.C.. According to the [study](http://www.demos.org/stacked-deck-how-dominance-politics-affluent-business-undermines-economic-mobility-america), social welfare and labor organization made up just 2 percent of all organized-interest activity—corporations, trade associations, and business groups accounted for 48 percent. Corporations and business groups spend much more on [lobbying](http://www.demos.org/stacked-deck-how-dominance-politics-affluent-business-undermines-economic-mobility-america) than organizations that represent large constituencies of Americans. For example, between 1998 and 2016, OpenSecrets.org reports that the [U.S. Chamber of Commerce](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s&showYear=a)—just one of many groups advocating for the interests of big business—spent $1.3 billion on lobbying the federal government compared to $720 million spent by [all labor unions](https:/\nDoc 4(Title: Corporate Capture Threatens Democratic Government) \nAmerica faces a crisis of corporate capture of democratic government, where the economic power of corporations has been translated into political power with disastrous effects for people’s lives. In his new book, [_Captured_](http://thenewpress.com/books/captured)_: The Corporate Infiltration of American Democracy_, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) warns that “corporations of vast wealth and remorseless staying power have moved into our politics to seize for themselves advantages that can be seized only by control over government.” The book illustrates what he calls, the “immense pressure deployed by the corporate sector in our government.” We must rebalance our democracy by changing the rules to limit the power of money over government and empower people to engage politically as a countervailing force.\n\nCurrently, the domination of big money over our public institutions prevents government from being responsive to Americans. This certainly is not a new phenomenon—but it is growing. Even in 2009, before the _Citizens United v. FEC_ [ruling](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/08-205.html) removed constraints on corporate political spending, 80 percent of Americans agreed with the following statement:\n\n> I am [worried](http://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/McCutcheon-document.pdf) that large political contributions will prevent Congress from tackling the important issues facing American today, like the economic crisis, rising energy costs, reforming health care, and global warming.\n\nIn the first presidential contest after the _Citizens United_ decision, 84 percent of Americans agreed that corporate political spending drowns out the voices of average Americans, and 83 percent believed that [corporations](http://www.demos.org/publication/citizens-actually-united-bi-partisan-opposition-corporate-political-spending-and-support) and corporate CEOs have too much political power and influence. This aligns with more recent research showing that 84 percent of people think [government](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/08115321/TrustInGovernmentSlidesPublic.pdf) is benefitting special interests, and 83 percent think government is benefitting big corporations and the wealthy.\n\nAs already noted, the undue influence of corporate interests on the functions of government is not new, and Sen. Whitehouse’s book explains how Americans have faced and overcome this threat before. America’s founders recognized the danger of corporate capture: In 1816, Thomas [Jefferson](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-10-02-0390) warned the new republic to “crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of their country.” Almost a century later, President Theodore [Roosevelt](https://books.google.com/books?id=eyy4DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT28&lpg=PT28&dq=theodore+roosevelt+In+order+to+insure+a+healthy+social+and+industrial+life&source=bl&ots=hjv4_E0P9G&sig=QDAEzpW2UENcXihvSkUouuIatD8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixwaqdjPfSAhWos1QKHRvOBlsQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&q=theodore%20roosevelt%20In%20order%20to%20insure%20a%20healthy%20social%20and%20industrial%20life&f=false), in his annual address to Congress in 1907, said:\n\n> The fortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, and vest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of necessity to give to the sovereign—that is, to the Government, which represents the people as a whole—some effective power of supervision over their corporate use.\n\nPresident Roosevelt was responsible for the [first federal ban](http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a1907tillmanact) on corporate political contributions. But now America’s rules for using money in politics are out of date, and our system of government is out of balance.

Notably, voter suppression [disproportionately disenfranchises](https://www.climatejusticecenter.org/newsletter/the-corporate-polluters-bankrolling-voter-suppression) communities of color, low-income groups, and Indigenous peoples—communities that [favor environmental regulation and climate change legislation](https://latinodecisions.com/blog/environmental-issues-will-affect-latino-voting-behavior-in-this-election/) significantly more than other demographics.

It does this by spreading misinformation, manipulating policy for self-interest against the public will, and stifling democratic rights through lawsuits, anti-protest laws, and voter suppression. In the case of the UAE’s COP28 presidency, the industry capture of these spaces is complete, with a state-backed fossil fuel company threatening to interfere with multilateral climate progress at the highest and most consequential level. As warning lights of democratic backsliding strobe across the world and endanger critical efforts to address the climate crisis, the twin threat of the fossil fuel industry’s attacks on climate action and the democratic functions necessary to take that action must not be ignored.\n\n> Unchecked, the oil and gas industry skews democracy, making governments more responsive to corporations than their own citizens.\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that corporate lobbying can be seen as both a legitimate and illegitimate practice depending on the context and manner in which it is carried out.

Technology also has enabled speech around the world, allowing access to information and giving people of every kind and category new avenues to organize. In some countries ruled by an authoritarian political regime, the ability to speak anonymously on the internet has been a boon. In places where expressing your opinion under your own name can be dangerous, the anonymity of the internet has allowed free opinion and expression to survive.\nBut this amazing technology has simultaneously accelerated a few unsettling trends.

We engage with stories that confirm our assumptions and biases, that do not challenge or expand our view of the world. Online monologues allow their writers to dig deeper and deeper into their own thoughts without considering the views of others. We become more entrenched in our own views. In some cases, it is almost as if we’re just talking to ourselves.\nAs this happens, the algorithms figure out what we want, what is comfortable, and they just keep feeding us more of the same.

In the process, our common ground gets eroded, and one of free speech’s most potent uses—as a check on power, often in the form of journalism—becomes undervalued.\nThe responsibility to listen\nFor our freedom of speech to work—to have meaning or the power to improve our democracy—we need to listen to one another.\nIn fact, we have a responsibility to listen, because listening allows us to extend the freedom of speech to others. This is why the right to assemble is so closely linked to the right to free speech. They share an amendment because speech is meaningless without an audience.\nWithout a congregation of listeners, there’s no difference between the preacher on a Sunday morning and the subway platform. Without a jury of open-minded and engaged listeners, or an attentive judge, or proper accountability, a trial becomes less just. If our elected officials do not consider the opinions of their constituents, then our political speech does little to advance our interests. Without the backing of a country or a congress, women’s suffrage does not achieve the Nineteenth Amendment, the Civil Ri\nDoc 2(Title:  of Afghanistan and Iraq by bombing them back to the Stone Age. Put freedom, liberty, patriotism, and other political buzz words on whatever you’re trying to sell and gullible people will buy it without a taking a second to even consider what they are actually being sold. As John Steinbeck (or Ronald Wright) said (it’s a disputed quote), “Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.” People seem to be okay being slaves so long as they believe there is a chance they can become slave owners if they “work hard enough” but it’s not true. You can work as hard as you want but if you weren’t afforded major advantages like a large inheritance or a father with a monopoly, you will likely never become one of those masters. People have to stop wanting to be a part of the bourgeoisie 1% we are supposed to be fighting. If you read the writings of real anarchists like Mikhail Bakunin, (who also warned us about the potential for “Red Terror” and an oppressive, pseudo “People’s state” Marxism would bring) James Guillaume, Nestor Makhno, Kropotkin, Camillo Berneri, Emma Goldman, and Adhémar Schwitzguébel, you will see they say there is no anarchy without abolishing wage slavery and freeing ourselves from our economic masters who have far more power than politicians. Anarchism evolved in tandem with many revoluntionary, socialist movements and that is the reason.) Why do ancaps believe market competition is the solution to everything? The more competition there is in the marketplace, the more incentive there is for lower wages, worse working conditions, more unethical practices, and so on as it becomes harder and harder to make a profit. Not everything in this world should have a price tag! I don’t know why that’s not obvious to everyone. Cooperation, collaboration, and collective ownership are much more conducive to productivity, innovation, and well-being in our economic, social, and environmental spheres. This doesn’t mean we should revert to communism. Due to Western propaganda, much of the West believes there is some dichotomy between capitalism and communism. But that is absurd. There are an infinite number of ways economies can run that are a far cry from either system. Communism involves the state (taking over that power and using it) and we have seen the disasterous dictatorships like the Soviet Union who have used “communism” as a justification for their despotism. Barter, resource based economies, gift economies, and cryptocurrencies work infinitely better. Elements of libertarian socialism (NOT state socialism) are also useful as they promote collective ownership of the means of production and distribution by need, as opposed to greed.\nPoliticians are just figure heads or puppets for the super rich. The people with the real power are the super rich like the Rothschilds who print money that they then lend to the government, so that the people are perpetually “in debt” to them. The regulations sensible people want on corporations don’t impede “mom and pop” small businesses. These regulations target the exploitative and ecocidal practices of mutlibillion dollar corporations. The only reason anyone should not want those regulations is because they profit from these corporations or they aspire to. And these types of regulations don’t require governments to enforce them so there’s nothing statist about wanting to reign in these massive, destructive corporations. These corporations would be put in check without governments. The starving populace wouldn’t put up with billionaires and their ridiculous bourgeois lifestyles if it wasn’t illegal to take their ill-gotten riches. To think less government regulations on corporations are the answer to our woes is beyond naive; It is incredibly dangerous. The banks robbed our economy and the American government bailed them out with $700 billion of taxpayer money. Corporations and governments are in b\nDoc 3(Title: hungry each night. Well that was probably true. They were all on a diet. But now we're told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty-stricken on the basis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a year. Welfare spending [is] 10 times greater than in the dark depths of the Depression. We're spending 45 billion dollars on welfare. Now do a little arithmetic, and you'll find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 million poor families, we'd be able to give each family 4,600 dollars a year. And this added to their present income should eliminate poverty. Direct aid to the poor, however, is only running only about 600 dollars per family. It would seem that someplace there must be some overhead.) Now, so now we declare \"war on poverty,\" or \"You, too, can be a Bobby Baker.\" Now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we're spending, one more program to the 30-odd we have -and remember, this new program doesn't replace any, it just duplicates existing programs - do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic? Well, in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't duplicated. This is the youth feature. We're now going to solve the dropout problem, juvenile delinquency, by reinstituting something like the old CCC camps [Civilian Conservation Corps], and we're going to put our young people in these camps. But again we do some arithmetic, and we find that we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4,700 dollars a year. We can send them to Harvard for 2,700! Course, don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency.\nBut seriously, what are we doing to those we seek to help? Not too long ago, a judge called me here in Los Angeles. He told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce. She had six children, was pregnant with her seventh. Under his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month. She wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise. She's eligible for 330 dollars a month in the Aid to Dependent Children Program. She got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very thing.\nYet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals. They say we're always \"against\" things - we're never \"for\" anything.\nWell, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so.\nNow, we're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end we've accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the problem.\nBut we're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood. They've called it \"insurance\" to us in a hundred million pieces of literature. But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare program. They only use the term \"insurance\" to sell it to the people. And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government, and the government has used that tax. There is no fund, because Robert Byers, the actuarial head, appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole. But he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax, they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble. And they're doing just that.\nA young man, 21 years of age, working at an average salary - his Social Security contribution would, in the open market, buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65. The \nDoc 4(Title: S.Hrg. 107-1050 — HUMAN CLONING) \nrecognizing the difficulties. For \nthere are indeed many features of modern life that will conspire to \nfrustrate efforts aimed at the human control of the biomedical project. \nFirst, we Americans believe in technological automatism: where we do \nnot foolishly believe that all innovation is progress, we \nfatalistically believe that it is inevitable (\\`\\`if it can be done, it \nwill be done, like it or not&#x27;&#x27;). Second, we believe in freedom: freedom \nof scientists to inquire, technologists to develop, and entrepreneurs \nto invest and profit, and freedom of private citizens to make use of \nexisting technologies to satisfy any and all personal desires, \nincluding the desire to reproduce by whatever means. Third, the \nbiomedical enterprise occupies the moral high ground of compassionate \nhumanitarianism, upholding the supreme values of modern life--cure \ndisease, prolong life, relieve suffering--in competition with which \nother moral goods rarely stand a chance. (\\`\\`What the public wants is \nnot to be sick,&#x27;&#x27; says James (DNA) Watson, \\`\\`and if we help them not to \nbe sick, they&#x27;ll be on our side.&#x27;&#x27;) Fourth, regarding other moral \ngoods, our cultural pluralism and easy-going relativism make it \ndifficult to reach consensus on what we should embrace and what we \nshould oppose: moral objections to this or that biomedical practice are \noften facilely dismissed as religious or sectarian. Many people are \nunwilling to pronounce judgments about what is good or bad, right and \nwrong, even in matters of great importance, even for themselves, never \nmind for others or society as a whole. Fifth, the biomedical project is \nnow deeply entangled with commerce: there are increasingly powerful \neconomic interests in favor of going full steam ahead, and no economic \ninterests in favor of going slow. Sixth, because we live in a \ndemocracy, we face political difficulties in gaining a consensus to \ndirect our future, and we have almost no political experience in trying \nto curtail the development of any new biomedical technology. Finally, \nand perhaps most troubling, our views of the meaning of our humanity \nhave been so transformed by the scientific-technological approach to \nthe world that we are in danger of forgetting what we have to lose, \nhumanly speaking.\n    But though the difficulties are real, our situation today is far \nfrom hopeless. Regarding each of the aforementioned impediments, there \nis another side to the story. Though we love our gadgets and believe in \nprogress, we have lost our innocence regarding technology. The \nenvironmental movement especially has alerted us to unintended damage \ncaused by unregulated technological advance and has taught us how \ncertain dangerous practices can be curbed. Though we favor freedom of \ninquiry, we recognize that experiments are deeds not speeches, and we \nprohibit experimentation on human subjects without their consent, even \nwhen cures from disease might be had by unfettered research. And we \nlimit so-called reproductive freedom by proscribing incest, polygamy, \nand the buying and selling of babies. Although we esteem medical \nprogress, biomedical institutions have ethics committees that judge \nresearch proposals on moral grounds, and, when necessary, uphold the \nprimacy of human freedom and dignity even over scientific discovery. \nNotwithstanding our moral pluralism, national commissions and review \nbodies have sometimes reached moral consensus to recommend limits on \npermissible scientific research and technological application. On the \neconomic front, the patenting of genes and life forms and the rapid \nrise of genomic commerce have elicited strong concerns and criticisms, \nleading even former enthusiasts for the new biology to recoil from the \nimpending commodification of human life. Though we lack political \ninstitutions experienced in setting limits on biomedical innovation, \nfederal agencies years ago rejected the develo\nDoc 5(Title: wners talking about their freedom to own people and use them as slaves. Some so-called “freedoms” impinge on other people’s freedoms. The freedom to bomb children, for example, (a “freedom” which is enjoyed by many politicians) is not a good freedom. But when certain people see the word “freedom” or “free” attached to anything, they dogmatically support it without really giving it much thought. The slave owner’s “freedom” to own slaves takes away the slave’s actual freedom. The same is true of capitalism, except the slavery in practice is wage slavery. When the relationship between employer and employee in unethical corporations is usually zero sum, what’s in one’s interest is often against the others. Higher wages for workers means less income for employers and higher income for employers generally means lower wages for workers as the easiest way to make more money is to cut worker’s wages or lay them off.) The myths that the “market will sort out” all the problems of the world and that “capitalism works if you vote with your wallet” have so many inherent problems. Firstly, as mentioned 80% of the world lives on less than $10 a day while the richest 1% own half of the world’s assets. That is hardly one man/woman, one vote, which is the principle the whole idea of voting is contingent upon. Secondly, the former group does not have the resources to “vote” with their wallets i.e. reward the most sustainable, fair-trade, ecologically conscious companies because the capitalist mass producers (the Wal-Marts of the world) use cheap labor and steal resources, undercutting all competition and when you barely have enough money to survive as a poorer person, you’re likely going to buy their products because they’re the cheapest, even when you would rather support the more ethical companies (that generally have more expensive products due to the costs involved in paying workers their fair share and sustainably and ethically acquiring resources). The poorest people end up shopping at companies they detest and that exploit people like them because they have very few options. What’s most profitable is not environmentally conscious or moral. It is the most depraved, iniquitous practices (destroying the Earth, stealing resources, robbing people, forcing people to work) that is most profitable and that’s what capitalism rewards.\nAnarchy doesn’t mean chaos or anything goes. Perfect anarchy can create widespread peace. Anarchy can have rules but only rules that everyone in the voluntarily created commune or group agrees to. In an autonomous or anarchic system, members can govern themselves and police their own communities, instead of electing representatives to “represent them” and having mindless police forces that just want to punish, harm, incarcerate, terrorize, steal, and rule over people. Anarchy is a huge part of the answer, but capitalism is one of the largest problems the world faces. However, “free market” propaganda in the West is so pervasive that many in the “freedom crowd” think it actually has something to do with freedom. “Free markets” don’t mean freedom for common people. They refer to the freedom masters of labor and economies have to exploit and enslave the populace.\nThey have the “freedom” to dig up resources like water from aquifers that should be considered parts of the commons and left alone for the health of the soil. They steal this water from the commons and sell it back to us at $3 a bottle and if you’re dying of dehydration and don’t have a cent, that bottle of water is still the same price and you will go to jail if you try to take it as an individual. What does that have to do with our freedom? Even in a society without government should corporate monopolies continue to exist, they would just replace every oppressive government institution. State and local jails would be replaced by private prisons. State armies would be replaced by private military contractors and mercenaries. Private police would replace state and\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that people may feel more evil today because of the anonymity and lack of consequences on the internet which enables hate speech and harassment.

However, giving raw bones under supervision can be safer compared to cooked bones. It's generally safer to provide commercially available chew toys and simulated dog bones that are made specifically for dogs.\n\n<answer> No </answer>\n\nThe safety depends on the type of bone (cooked vs. raw), size, and supervision.

Try a Bone After a Meal\nBecause they’ve just eaten, your dog is already full. As a result, they’re not likely to chew the bone as quickly.\nPut the Bone in the Fridge After 10 to 15 Minutes\nAfter your dog has spent 10 to 15 minutes chewing on the bone, take it away and put it in the refrigerator. Dogs have powerful jaws, and you don’t want your dog to ingest too much bone.\nThrow Out a Bone After a Few Days\nDispose of a bone after three or four days. Bacteria can grow on the surface and cause intestinal problems for your dog.\nGive Large Breeds Large Bones\nBones should be larger than the length of the dog’s muzzle, so they can’t be swallowed whole. So try giving large breeds, such as German Shepherd Dogs, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs, large bones. A beef shank bone is a good example of the type of bone to give to a large dog.\nSupervise Your Dog\nIt’s very important to check periodically on your dog when they are chewing a bone. Be ready to remove the bone if it’s breaking apart or getting too small.\nBone Alternatives\nConsider playing it safe and only providing commercially available chew toys and simulated dog bones that are made for dogs of all sizes.\nDoc 2(Title: AKC is a participant in affiliate advertising programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to akc.org. If you purchase a product through this article, we may receive a portion of the sale.) We’ve all heard the phrase “give a dog a bone,” but you might want to consider alternative treats to dog bones.\nBones can be a good source of minerals and other nutrients and help satisfy your dog’s appetite. Chewing stimulates saliva enzymes and helps prevent plaque buildup on teeth and gum disease. And a dog chewing on a bone is less inclined to excessively scratch or lick their paws.\nHowever, chewing bones can pose potential dangers to dogs. If you’re considering giving your dog a bone, consider whether it’s the right treat for your pet.\nPotential Health Hazards\nFatty Bones Can Cause Pancreatitis\nRib bones, especially pork rib bones, are high in fat. Dogs aren’t built to handle this amount of saturated fat, which can cause pancreatitis.\nPancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, often caused by too much fat in the diet. It can range from mild to severe, but symptoms typically include vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. Severe cases can be deadly, so it’s important to seek veterinary attention right away if you suspect your dog may have pancreatitis.\nCooked Bones Can Shatter and Cause Damage\nCooked bones splinter into shards. So if your dog eats one, they might choke on the tiny pieces. These pieces can cause serious damage to the dog’s mouth, throat, or intestines. Cooking can also remove nutrients from the bone.\nIf your dog does ingest cooked bones, give your veterinarian a call for advice or schedule an appointment to rule out any serious outcomes. Be careful to keep platters containing bones out of reach when you’re cooking or putting food on the table. And avoid putting bones in any trash cans that your dog might be able to get into.\nFragments Can Be Choking Hazards\nWhen your dog gnaws on a bone, they might chew it down into small pieces. Those fragments are a major choking hazard. Bone fragments can easily get lodged in your dog’s throat, blocking the airways and creating an emergency situation.\nAlso, these chunks are typically very sharp. They can puncture and cut the inside of your dog’s mouth, tongue, stomach, and intestines. Fragments of bone, especially rib bones, can also lodge in the descending colon near the rectum, causing constipation-like symptoms and pain. If this occurs, bring your dog to the veterinarian or emergency clinic for treatment.\nChunks of Bone Might Cause Blockages\nThe chance of bone chunks getting stuck in the intestines is fairly high. Blockages can occur if a bone fragment is too large to pass through the gut and obstructs the flow of all other digested food through the gastrointestinal tract. Obstructions are very serious and can quickly lead to severe illness and death.\nBones Can Irritate Canine Stomachs\nA bone and its marrow can cause diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome. Bones could also further irritate already sensitive stomachs.\nWhat to Do When Giving Your Dog a Bone\nAsk Your Vet About Raw Meat Bones\nSome veterinarians suggest raw meat bones for dogs. But raw meat bones may carry bacteria like salmonella. And bones that are too hard, even raw bones, could damage your dog’s teeth. If a bone is harder than a tooth, the tooth can fracture and your dog will need an expensive dental evaluation and treatment. So before giving your dog a raw meat bone, ask your vet if this would be a safe treat.\nGive Your Dog a Bone if They’re Alone\nIt’s a good idea not to give your dog a bone if there’s another dog visiting. Even friendly dogs can be very protective of their bones.\nTry a Bone After a Meal\nBecause they’ve just eaten, your dog is already full. As a result, they’re not likely to chew the bone as quickly.\nPut the Bone in the Fridge After 10 to 15 Minutes\nAfter your dog has spent 10 to 15 minutes chewing on the bone, take it away and p\nDoc 3(Title: Weâre sorry, this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.)

Therefore, it's up to you to decide what's best for you. Some tips to keep in mind are below.) - Herbal supplements may be harmful when taken by themselves, with other substances, or in large doses. For example, some studies have shown that kava kava, an herb that has been used to help with stress and anxiety, may cause liver damage. And St. John, which some people use for depression, may cause certain cancer drugs to not work as well as they should.\n- Tell your doctor if you're taking any dietary supplements, even vitamins, no matter how safe you think they are. This is very important. Even though there may be ads or claims that something has been used for years, they do not prove that it's safe or effective. This is even more true when combined with your medicines.\nDiet alone cannot control cancer\nIt's common for people with cancer to have questions about different foods to eat during treatment. Yet it's important to know there isn't just one food or special diet that has proved to control cancer.\n- We all have different bodies and ways we metabolize food. What is best for someone else may not be right for you. Because of your individual nutrition needs, it’s best to talk with the doctor in charge of your treatment about the foods you should be eating.\n- It's always important for you to have a healthy diet, but especially now. Do the best you can to have a well-rounded approach, eating a variety of foods that are good for you. For advice about eating during and after cancer treatment, see the NCI booklet, Eating Hints.\nIt’s important to know that there are no studies that prove that any special diet, food, vitamin, mineral, dietary supplement, herb, or combination of these can slow cancer, cure it, or keep it from coming back. In fact, some of these products can cause other problems by changing how your cancer treatment works.\nTalk with your doctor before you use CAM\nCancer patients who want to use CAM should talk with their doctor or nurse. This is an important step because things that seem safe could be harmful or even interfere with your cancer treatment. It's also a good idea to learn if the therapy you're thinking about has been proven to do what it claims to do. Some examples of questions to ask:\nWhat types of CAM therapies might help me\n- reduce my stress and anxiety?\n- feel less tired?\n- deal with cancer symptoms and side effects, such as pain or nausea?\n- sleep better?\nAlways tell your doctor about what complementary health approaches you’re using. Whether it's something that seems simple, such as massage or a type of exercise, it's good to let your doctor or nurse know what you're doing. Don’t forget to tell them about over-the-counter and prescription medicines that you're taking. Make a list in advance and take it with you.\nDon't be afraid to ask questions. It's okay to feel hesitant when asking about using CAM. But doctors want to know what concerns you have so they can give you the best possible care. Let them know that you would like to use CAM methods and want their input.\nQuestions to ask a CAM practitioner\nChoosing a CAM practitioner should be done with the same care as choosing a doctor. Ask your doctor, nurse, or social worker at your cancer center to help you find a practitioner for you.

Many Americans, especially black individuals, believe that the legacy of slavery impacts the current social standing of black people and perceive systemic inequalities and discrimination.

Most say legacy of slavery affects black people’s position in society a great deal or fair amount\nFor the most part, Americans believe slavery continues to have an impact on black people’s status. About six-in-ten U.S. adults say the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people in American society today either a great deal (31%) or a fair amount (32%). Some 36% say slavery doesn’t have much or anything at all to do with the current situation of black people.\nBlacks are by far the most likely to say slavery continues to have an impact. More than eight-in-ten say slavery affects the position of black people at least a fair amount, including 59% who say it does so a great deal. By comparison, 26% of whites, 29% of Hispanics and 33% of Asians say slavery affects the situation of black people today a great deal, though majorities of each group say it does so at least a fair amount.\nAmong whites, 18- to 29-year-olds are the most likely to say slavery still has an impact today. About two-thirds of whites in that age group say this (68%), compared with 55% of 30- to 49-year-olds, 54% of 50- to 64-year-olds and 60% of those 65 and older. Age differences are less evident among blacks.\nEducation is also associated with views of whether slavery still has an effect today, and this is the case among whites and blacks. Whites with a bachelor’s degree or higher (67%) are more likely to say that slavery continues to have a great deal or a fair amount of influence on black people’s position in society, compared with 56% of those with some college experience and 50% of those with a high school diploma or less. Blacks with at least a bachelor’s degree or some college experience (90% of each group) are also more likely than those with a high school diploma or less (76%) to say this.\nWhite Democrats are twice as likely as white Republicans to say that the legacy of slavery has had a lasting impact (80% vs. 40%). Black Democrats are even more likely to say this is the case (87% do so).\nDoc 2(Title: More than four-in-ten Americans say the country still has work to do to give black people equal rights with whites. Blacks, in particular, are skeptical that black people will ever have equal rights in this country.) Americans generally think being white is an advantage in society, while about half or more say being black or Hispanic hurts people’s ability to get ahead. Opinions are more mixed when it comes to what impact, if any, being Asian or Native American has.\nMost adults, regardless of race or ethnicity, say blacks are treated less fairly than whites in encounters with police and by the criminal justice system, but there’s less consensus about the treatment of blacks in other situations, such as when applying for a loan or mortgage or in stores or restaurants.\nThis chapter also explores what Americans see as obstacles for black people getting ahead as well as attitudes about what impact, if any, the legacy of slavery has on the current status of blacks.\nMajorities see advantages for whites, disadvantages for blacks\nA majority of adults say that being white helps people’s ability to get ahead in the country at least a little (59%); 28% say being white neither helps nor hurts and 12% say it hurts. On the flip side, a majority (56%) sees being black as a disadvantage, with 25% saying it hurts people’s ability to get ahead a lot. About a quarter (26%) say being black neither helps nor hurts and 17% say it helps at least a little.\nMore also say that being Hispanic hurts people’s ability to get ahead in this country (51%) than say it helps (18%) or that it neither helps nor hurts (30%). Opinions are more split when it comes to the impact of being Native American – about the same shares say this hurts as say it neither helps nor hurts, while a smaller share says it helps. And while a plurality says being Asian neither helps nor hurts, more say it helps (34%) than hurts (21%) people’s ability to get ahead.\nMajorities across racial and ethnic groups say being white helps one’s ability to get ahead, though Asians (73%), blacks (69%) and Hispanics (61%) are more likely than whites (56%) to say this.\nAmong whites, education and partisanship are linked to perceptions of white advantage. About three-quarters of whites with at least a bachelor’s degree (72%) say being white helps at least a little, compared with 52% of those with some college experience and 43% of those with a high school education or less.\nWhite Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are about twice as likely as white Republicans and Republican leaners to say being white helps one’s ability to get ahead (78% vs. 38%). Meanwhile, 22% of white Republicans say being white hurts people’s ability to get ahead at least a little (compared with 3% of white Democrats). White Democrats are more likely than black Democrats to say whites have an advantage (78% vs. 71%).\nAmong blacks, 76% of those with a bachelor’s degree or more education say being white helps a lot, compared with 61% of those with some college and 49% of those with a high school diploma or less education (a majority in this group – 57% – says being white helps at least a little). And while about six-in-ten blacks ages 30 and older say there’s a lot of advantage in being white, about half (49%) of those younger than 30 say the same (again, majorities of blacks across age groups say being white helps at least a little).\nAsked about the extent to which being black helps or hurts one’s ability to get ahead, 68% of blacks and 64% of Asians say being black hurts at least a little; 55% of whites and half of Hispanics say the same. Blacks are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to say being black hurts a lot: 42% say this vs. a third or fewer among Asians, whites and Hispanics.\nAmong whites, blacks and Hispanics, those with at least a bachelor’s degree are more likely than those with less education to say race hurts blacks’ ability to get ahead.

White Democrats are also far more likely than white Republicans to say blacks are treated less fairly when seeking medical treatment, in stores or restaurants, when applying for loans, and in hiring, pay and promotions.) Similar shares of white and black Democrats say black people are treated less fairly than whites in dealing with the police, by the criminal justice system, and when voting in elections. Black Democrats are more likely than their white counterparts to say this is the case in hiring, pay and promotions (86% of black Democrats say black people are treated less fairly), when applying for a loan or mortgage (78%), in stores or restaurants (73%), and when seeking medical treatment (61%).\nPlurality says country hasn’t gone far enough in giving black people equal rights with whites\nMore than four-in-ten U.S. adults (45%) say the country hasn’t gone far enough in giving blacks equal rights with whites; 15% say it’s gone too far and 39% say it’s been about right. Among those who say the country still has work to do, most think there will eventually be racial equality, but views on the country’s racial progress so far and in the future vary considerably across racial and ethnic groups.\nAbout eight-in-ten blacks (78%) say the country hasn’t gone far enough in giving black people equal rights with whites. Among whites, 37% say the country hasn’t gone far enough, while 19% say it’s gone too far and 43% say it’s been about right. Hispanics fall between whites and blacks, with 48% saying the country has not gone far enough in giving blacks equal rights with whites.\nSimilar shares of blacks across age groups say the country hasn’t gone far enough when it comes to giving black people equal rights with whites. And large shares of blacks across education levels say this is the case, although those with a bachelor’s degree or more education are particularly likely to do so: 87% say the country hasn’t gone far enough vs. 77% of those with some college and 75% of those with less education.\nAmong whites, those under 30 are much more likely to say the country still has work to do to achieve equality between blacks and whites – 51% say this, compared with 38% of whites ages 30 to 49, 28% of those 50 to 64 and 37% of those 65 and older. There are also differences by education, with whites with at least a bachelor’s degree more likely than those with less education to say the country hasn’t gone far enough on this issue.\nWhite Democrats and Republicans also differ widely in their assessments of the country’s progress on racial equality. Most white Democrats (64%) say the country hasn’t gone far enough in giving black people equal rights with whites. Among white Republicans, about half (53%) say it’s been about right, while a sizable minority (31% vs. 5% of white Democrats) say the country has gone too far. Black Democrats are even more likely than white Democrats to say the country still has work to do: 82% say it hasn’t gone far enough in giving black people equal rights with whites.\nBlacks are skeptical about prospects for racial equality\nMost blacks (64%) who say the country hasn’t gone far enough in giving black people equal rights with whites – and half of all black adults – say it’s not too or not at all likely that the country will eventually achieve racial equality. Whites who say the country still has work to do on this front are more optimistic: 80% say it’s very or somewhat likely that black people will eventually have equal rights in this country. Hispanics’ views are more mixed. Of those who say the country hasn’t gone far enough in giving black people equal rights with whites, 54% say this is likely to happen eventually and 46% say it’s not too or not at all likely.\nMost say legacy of slavery affects black people’s position in society a great deal or fair amount\nFor the most part, Americans believe slavery continues t\nDoc 4(Title: y the same.) The views of blacks and whites are more closely aligned when it comes to the impact that family instability (57% and 55%, respectively) and a lack of good role models (51% and 52%) has on black progress. However, the relative ranking of these items varies among blacks and whites. While whites rank family instability and a lack of good role models above or on a par with societal factors as major reasons that blacks may have a harder time getting ahead than whites, fewer blacks say these items are major reasons than say the same about lower quality schools, discrimination, and lack of jobs.\nBlacks are more likely than whites to say a lack of motivation to work hard may be holding blacks back: 43% of black adults and 30% of whites say this is a major reason blacks are having a harder time getting ahead than whites. 3\nMore whites and blacks say individual discrimination is a bigger problem than institutional racism\nOn balance, the public thinks that when it comes to discrimination against black people in the U.S. today, discrimination that is based on the prejudice of individual people is a bigger problem than discrimination that is built into the nation’s laws and institutions. This is the case among both blacks and whites, but while whites offer this opinion by a large margin (70% to 19%), blacks are more evenly divided (48% to 40%).\nStill, large majorities of black adults say that blacks in this country are treated unfairly in a range of institutional settings – from the criminal justice system, to the workplace to banks and financial institutions.\nRoughly two-thirds of black adults say that blacks are treated less fairly than whites when applying for a loan or mortgage (66%) and in the workplace (64%). Somewhat smaller shares – though still upwards of four-in-ten – see unfair treatment for blacks in stores and restaurants (49%) and when voting in elections (43%).\nAcross all of these realms, whites are much less likely than blacks to perceive unequal treatment – with differences ranging from 23 to 42 percentage points.\nPersonal experiences with discrimination\nA majority of blacks (71%) say that they have experienced discrimination or been treated unfairly because of their race or ethnicity. Roughly one-in-ten (11%) say this happens to them on a regular basis, while 60% say they have experienced this rarely or from time to time.\nAmong blacks, men and women are equally likely to report having personally experienced racial discrimination, and there are no large gaps by age. There is an educational divide, however: Blacks with at least some college experience (81%) are much more likely than blacks who never attended college (59%) to say they have been discriminated against because of their race.\nExperiences with racial discrimination are far less common among whites, but a sizable minority (30%) of white adults report that they have been discriminated against or treated unfairly because of their race or ethnicity. Only 2% say this happens to them regularly and 28% say it occurs less frequently. Whites who say they have a lot of contact with blacks are more likely to say they’ve been discriminated against because of their race than are whites who have less contact with blacks.\nWhile some whites report being treated unfairly at times because of their race, the overall impact is relatively minor. Only 5% of whites say their race or ethnicity has made it harder for them to succeed in life. A majority of whites (62%) say their race hasn’t made much of difference in their ability to succeed, and 31% say their race has made things easier for them.\nThere is a sharp educational divide among blacks on the overall impact their race has had on their ability to succeed. Fully 55% of blacks with a four-year college degree say their race has made it harder for them to succeed in life. Some 45% of blacks who attended college but did not receive a bachelor’s degree say the same. Among blacks with a high school education or less, a far l\nDoc 5(Title: ) white Democrats say the country needs to continue making changes to achieve racial equality between whites and blacks, just 36% of white Republicans agree; 54% of white Republicans believe the country has already made the changes necessary for blacks to have equal rights with whites.) How blacks and whites view the state of race in America\nThere are large gaps between blacks and whites in their views of race relations and racial inequality in the United States. Explore how the opinions of blacks and whites vary by age, education, gender and party identification in key questions from our report.\nThe economic realities of black and white households\nTrends in key economic and demographic indicators provide some context for the experiences and outlook of blacks today. While there has been clear progress in closing the white-black gap in some areas – particularly when it comes to high school completion rates – decades-old black-white gaps in economic well-being persist and have even widened in some cases.\nThe racial gap extends to household wealth – a measure where the gap has widened since the Great Recession. In 2013, the most recent year available, the median net worth of households headed by whites was roughly 13 times that of black households ($144,200 for whites compared with $11,200 for blacks).\nFor most Americans, household wealth is closely tied to home equity, and there are sharp and persistent gaps in homeownership between blacks and whites. In 2015, 72% of white household heads owned a home, compared with 43% of black household heads.\nAnd on the flipside of wealth – poverty – racial gaps persist, even though the poverty rate for blacks has come down significantly since the mid-1980s. Blacks are still more than twice as likely as whites to be living in poverty (26% compared with 10% in 2014).\nBlacks and whites are divided on reasons that blacks may be struggling to get ahead\nDespite these economic realities, when asked about the financial situation of blacks compared with whites today, about four-in-ten blacks either say that both groups are about equally well off (30%) or that blacks are better off than whites financially (8%). Still, about six-in-ten (58%) blacks say that, as a group, they are worse off than whites.\nAmong whites, a plurality (47%) say blacks are worse off financially, while 37% say blacks are about as well off as whites and 5% say blacks are doing better than whites.\nBlacks and whites with a bachelor’s degree are more likely than those with less education to say blacks are worse off financially than whites these days. Roughly eight-in-ten (81%) blacks with a four-year college degree say this, compared with 61% of blacks with only some college education and 46% of blacks with a high school diploma or less. In a similar pattern, about two-thirds (66%) of white college graduates say blacks are worse off financially than whites, while fewer among those who attended college but did not receive a degree (47%) and those who did not attend college (29%) say the same.\nWhen asked about the underlying reasons that blacks may be having a harder time getting ahead than whites, large majorities of black adults point to societal factors. Two-thirds or more blacks say failing schools (75%), racial discrimination (70%) and a lack of jobs (66%) are major reasons that black people may have a harder time getting ahead these days.\nOn each of these items, the views of blacks differ significantly from those of whites. But, by far, the biggest gap comes on racial discrimination, where only 36% of whites say this is a major reason that blacks may be struggling to get ahead, 34 percentage points lower than the share of blacks who say the same.\nThe views of blacks and whites are more closely aligned when it comes to the impact that family instability (57% and 55%, respectively) and a lack of good role models (51% and 52%) has on black progress.

One night I burnt my hand at around midnight and he came down the stairs, took my phone, and screamed about how I was being “Too loud” I showed him my hand and he said “Does it look like that’s my problem?!” The only reason I choose not to call CPS is because she takes the time to listens to me and my opinions and problems. At my dad’s house it’s the opposite, we have a clean and organized house with good food and nice rooms, but on the other hand, my father doesn’t care about my emotions or mental health AT ALL. I’m forced to take all advanced classes while I’m also expected to be on our varsity team for track and cross country. Right now (summer) I’m expected to run at least 30 miles a week and get up at 5 am to do so, even though I’d much rather sleep. Any time I attempt to bring up the fact that it is very unpleasant for me to have to do all these things and run my dad forces me too and disregards any shred of sympathy. I’ve been grounded from my phone for months at a time for ridiculous things like texting a friend he’s never met. The funny thing is is that he treats my stepsister like a perfect little princess even though she’s more of a trouble maker than I am. She fails classes, messes around with guys, and has nothing expected from her other than to keep her room clean. I’m constantly being lectured about things I’ve never done, and I feel like I have no voice around him or good options regarding my situation. At one point I felt so hurt by his lack of love I started self-harming. I tried to hide it from him, but when he found out instead of being worried, he yelled at me and lectured me. I have major anxiety issues and I’m extremely self-conscious, I’m easily hurt by people’s words and am scolded for crying over small things. On top of my parents I have abusive siblings who pick on me, gossip about me, and physically hurt me and my parents do nothing about it. I hate myself, the way I look, just everything… I wish I could be more like my siblings.)

It’s still unknown what mental damage that (evidently) caused me. Before finishing primary school I was kicked so hard in the testicles by a much older and stronger girl that one of them failed to develop and drop properly, probably stunting my growth and causing unknown developmental issues. They did no follow-up with the school, …didn’t seem to care. They were invasive of my privacy and once the mother openly confronted me about some drawings I did which I hid under my bed and a stupid ‘journal’ thing I kept as pure fantasy, the kind of release a child needs developmentally, nothing but pure fantasy and expression. She exclaimed how it was ‘offensive’ to her. Not seeing how she was over-stepping a boundary and widening the tentative gap of trust between us. I still to this day have no idea what she did with those. I’m pretty sure she gave them to someone to ‘analyze’ or even handed them in to the police or something. As I grew up and went off to college, I’d return home to find my wardrobes empty, the mother would routinely go through my clothing and remove it to give to charity. Then think nothing of it even deny she touched anything. I used to struggle in school (Surprise, surprise… Unchecked head-trauma and absolutely no support or guidance at home…?) And once a Right-wing nutcase teacher gave me the lowest-possible mark out of spite purely because she had opposing political views to my Councilor father. Again, they did nothing about it. I was raped as a very young, vulnerable teen (Possibly just turned 17) on 2 separate occasions by 2 different abusive over-weight women. I couldn’t open up about that at home, I had no support network or love there. With no coping mechanisms and no known-strategies, I had to push it down, try to move-on and cope myself. When I passed my driving test the father had the audacity to say to my instructor (in-front of my face) that, “Well, I know you have to let a certain percentage pass” ..Yeah. No, “Congratulations” for me. When I was harassed constantly by a newly-arrived CID inspector all over the town I was growing up in, the parents turned a blind-eye. Didn’t want to know. I was bullied to 2 older kids in school, every chance they got to mess with me they did, eventually I was assaulted by one, when I went home with a sore eye-socket the mother screamed at ‘me’ for it. Not the reaction you would expect from a ‘loving parent’ I know families who would go out of their way to spill blood over something like protecting their children. But, oh well. Then I had to get the hell out of that toxic home. I began failing at life, I struggled with many addictions, primarily alcohol problems. There was no love or concern about that. I started to go off the rails, admittedly. But what chance did I have? Looking back I just can’t blame myself for the trouble I fell into. I was unloved, raised in an un-loving home environment. Taught absolutely nothing and never given any guidance to help me through life to speak of. …Yea, I hate my parents. I now have a dead father and a mother I haven’t spoken a word to in almost 10 years. I abhor the adoption system too, as I see it as their fault they let all this happen to me.)

They did no follow-up with the school, …didn’t seem to care. They were invasive of my privacy and once the mother openly confronted me about some drawings I did which I hid under my bed and a stupid ‘journal’ thing I kept as pure fantasy, the kind of release a child needs developmentally, nothing but pure fantasy and expression. She exclaimed how it was ‘offensive’ to her. Not seeing how she was over-stepping a boundary and widening the tentative gap of trust between us. I still to this day have no idea what she did with those. I’m pretty sure she gave them to someone to ‘analyze’ or even handed them in to the police or something. As I grew up and went off to college, I’d return home to find my wardrobes empty, the mother would routinely go through my clothing and remove it to give to charity. Then think nothing of it even deny she touched anything. I used to struggle in school (Surprise, surprise… Unchecked head-trauma and absolutely no support or guidance at home…?) And once a Right-wing nutcase teacher gave me the lowest-possible mark out of spite purely because she had opposing political views to my Councilor father. Again, they did nothing about it. I was raped as a very young, vulnerable teen (Possibly just turned 17) on 2 separate occasions by 2 different abusive over-weight women. I couldn’t open up about that at home, I had no support network or love there. With no coping mechanisms and no known-strategies, I had to push it down, try to move-on and cope myself. When I passed my driving test the father had the audacity to say to my instructor (in-front of my face) that, “Well, I know you have to let a certain percentage pass” ..Yeah. No, “Congratulations” for me. When I was harassed constantly by a newly-arrived CID inspector all over the town I was growing up in, the parents turned a blind-eye. Didn’t want to know. I was bullied to 2 older kids in school, every chance they got to mess with me they did, eventually I was assaulted by one, when I went home with a sore eye-socket the mother screamed at ‘me’ for it. Not the reaction you would expect from a ‘loving parent’ I know families who would go out of their way to spill blood over something like protecting their children. But, oh well. Then I had to get the hell out of that toxic home. I began failing at life, I struggled with many addictions, primarily alcohol problems. There was no love or concern about that. I started to go off the rails, admittedly. But what chance did I have? Looking back I just can’t blame myself for the trouble I fell into. I was unloved, raised in an un-loving home environment. Taught absolutely nothing and never given any guidance to help me through life to speak of. …Yea, I hate my parents. I now have a dead father and a mother I haven’t spoken a word to in almost 10 years. I abhor the adoption system too, as I see it as their fault they let all this happen to me.)

We don't really know. We can define what it is as a field of influence, because we know how it operates in the universe. And some scientists think that it is made up of particles called gravitons which travel at the speed of light. However, if we are to be honest, we do not know what gravity \"is\" in any fundamental way - we only know how it behaves.\nHere is what we do know...\nGravity is a force of attraction that exists between any two masses, any two bodies, any two particles. Gravity is not just the attraction between objects and the Earth. It is an attraction that exists between all objects, everywhere in the universe. Sir Isaac Newton (1642 -- 1727) discovered that a force is required to change the speed or direction of movement of an object. He also realized that the force called \"gravity\" must make an apple fall from a tree, or humans and animals live on the surface of our spinning planet without being flung off. Furthermore, he deduced that gravity forces exist between all objects.\nNewton's \"law\" of gravity is a mathematical description of the way bodies are observed to attract one another, based on many scientific experiments and observations. The gravitational equation says that the force of gravity is proportional to the product of the two masses (m1 and m2), and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between their centers of mass. Mathematically speaking,\nF=Gm1m2 / r2,\nwhere G is called the Gravitational Constant. It has a value of 6.6726 x 10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2.\nThe effect of gravity extends from each object out into space in all directions, and for an infinite distance. However, the strength of the gravitational force reduces quickly with distance. Humans are never aware of the Sun's gravity pulling them, because the pull is so small at the distance between the Earth and Sun. Yet, it is the Sun's gravity that keeps the Earth in its orbit! Neither are we aware of the pull of lunar gravity on our bodies, but the Moon's gravity is responsible for the ocean tides on Earth.\nThe StarChild site is a service of the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC), within the Astrophysics Science Division (ASD) at NASA/ GSFC.\nStarChild Authors: The StarChild Team\nStarChild Graphics & Music: Acknowledgments\nStarChild Project Leader: Dr. Laura A.\nWhitlock\nCurator:\nResponsible NASA Official:\nDoc 2(Title: Gravity) In physics, gravity (from Latin gravitas 'weight'[1]), also known as gravitation or a gravitational interaction,[2] is a fundamental interaction, which may be described as the effect of a field that is generated by a gravitational source such as mass.\nThe gravitational attraction between clouds of primordial hydrogen and clumps of dark matter in the early universe caused the hydrogen gas to coalesce, eventually condensing and fusing to form stars. At larger scales this resulted in galaxies and clusters, so gravity is a primary driver for the large-scale structures in the universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.\nGravity is described by the general theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, which describes gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the black hole's event horizon.[3] However, for most applications, gravity is sufficiently well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as an attractive force between any two bodies that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\nScientists are looking for a theory that describes gravity in the framework of quantum mechanics (quantum gravity),[4] which would unify gravity and the other known fundamental interactions of physics in a single mathematical framework (a theory of everything).[5]\nOn the surface of a planetary body such as on Earth, this leads to gravitational acceleration of all objects towards the body, modified by the centrifugal effects arising from the rotation of the body.[6] In this context, gravity gives weight to physical objects and is essential to understanding the mechanisms that are responsible for surface water waves, lunar tides and substantially contributes to weather patterns. Gravitational weight also has many important biological functions, helping to guide the growth of plants through the process of gravitropism and influencing the circulation of fluids in multicellular organisms.\nCharacterization\nGravity is the word used to describe a physical law, a fundamental physical interaction that derives primarily from mass, and the observed consequences of that interaction on objects. Gravity is the law that every object with mass attracts every other object in the universe in proportion to each mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force of gravity, F is written using the gravitational constant, G, as[7] for two masses, m, and m′ separated by a distance r.\nGravity is considered to be one of four fundamental interactions. The electromagnetic force law is similar to the force law for gravity: both depend upon the square of the inverse distance between objects in typical interactions. The ratio of gravitational attraction of two electrons to their electrical repulsion is 1 to 4.17×1042.[7] As a result, gravity can generally be neglected at the level of subatomic particles.[8] Gravity becomes the most significant interaction between objects at the scale of astronomical bodies, and it determines the motion of satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. Gravity is also fundamental in another sense: the inertial mass that appears in Newton's second law is the same as the gravitational mass. This equivalence principle is a scientific hypothesis that has been tested experimentally to more than one part in a trillion.[9]\nHistory\nAncient world\nThe nature and mechanism of gravity were explored by a wide range of ancient scholars. In Ancient Greece, Aristotle believed that each of the classical elements had a natural place in the universe which it tends to move toward - earth at the center of the universe (the center of the Earth, which was known to be \nDoc 3(Title: Since gravity is unlimited, can we use it as an infinite energy source?) Category: Physics Published: January 8, 2014\nBy: Christopher S. Baird, author of The Top 50 Science Questions with Surprising Answers and Associate Professor of Physics at West Texas A&M University\nNo, gravity can not be used as an infinite energy source. In fact, strictly speaking, gravity itself can not be used as an energy source at all. You are confusing forces with energy, which are very different things. Energy is a property of objects, such as balls, atoms, light beams, or batteries. In contrast, forces describe the interaction between objects. Forces are the way that energy is transferred from one object to another when they interact, but forces are not the energy itself. Gravity is a force, so it just provides one way for objects to exchange and transform energy to different states.\nIf I lift a bowling ball to the top of a hill and let it go, the ball falls, speeds up, and seems to gain energy. Isn't this a case of gravity giving energy to the bowling ball? No. Again, gravity is just a force, so it just describes how objects interact. The energy that the ball displays as a falling motion came from my muscles when I hefted the bowling ball to the top of the hill, and not from gravity. Gravity just provides a way to temporarily store energy in an object. We call the energy that an object gains when you lift it against a force \"potential energy\". The energy comes from the lifting agent and not from the force. The force just provides a way to transfer energy from one object (my muscles) to another object (potential energy in the lifted ball). When I let go of the ball, gravity converts the potential energy of the ball to the kinetic energy (motional energy) of the ball. But the ball can never gain more kinetic energy than the total potential energy that I put into it by lifting it.\nThis concept is true of all forces, and not just gravity. Two magnets attract each other and fly together, speeding up and seeming to gain energy. You may think that the energy has come from the magnetic force. In truth, the energy comes from your hand pulling the two magnets apart against the magnetic force. The magnetic force just provides a way for potential energy to be stored in the magnet (by virtue of you pulling them apart, not just by virtue of them being magnets), and then converted from potential energy to kinetic energy. Any time you push an object to a new location against a force, you are giving it potential energy.\nIt is true that gravity is \"unlimited\" in the sense that it never turns off. Earth's gravity will never go away as long as it has mass. But since this is just a force and not an energy, the never-ending nature of gravity cannot be used to extract infinite energy, or any energy at all, for that matter. Think of gravity loosely like a rubber band. Stretch the rubber band and let go and it snaps back into place. You can therefore store potential energy in a rubber band by stretching it, and this potential energy becomes kinetic energy when you let go. But an unstretched rubber band just sitting there won't move at all, and can't create any energy. The energy you see in the rubber band snapping comes from you stretching it and not from the rubber band itself. Neglecting heat losses, the kinetic energy that comes out of the rubber band (how much it snaps) is exactly equal to the potential energy that you put into it using your muscles (how much you stretch it). Lifting an object against gravity is just like stretching the rubber band.\nConfusing energy and forces leads to non-sensical ideas such as free energy (perpetual motion) machines. Such machines always fail precisely because forces are not energy, and you can't extract one single bit of energy from a force itself. For instance, a \"free energy\" machine could consist of a ball that rolls down a hill and hits a paddle, which turns a wheel. The problem with this machine is that the ball has to be retu\nDoc 4(Title: bjects.[dubious – discuss] Field models are local: the field values on a sphere completely determine the effects of gravity with the sphere.[85]: 45) Fields are also used in general relativity, but rather than vectors over Euclidean space, the entities are tensors over spacetime. The Einstein field equations relate the 10 independent values in the tensors to the distribution of mass and energy in space.[dubious – discuss]\nAction principles\nA third completely different way to derive a model of gravity is based on action principles. This formulation represents the effects of gravity on a system in a mathematically abstract way. The state of the system, for example the position and velocity of every particle, is expressed as a single mathematical entity. Each state has an associated energy property called the Lagrangian; the physically allowed changes to the state of the system minimize the value of this property. The path of the state is not a path in physical space, but rather in a high-dimensional state space: each point along the path corresponds to a different position and or velocity collectively for all particles in the system. This formulation does not express the forces or fields of the individual particles.[85]: 46 Modern theories of physics rely on these action principles.[86]: 396 The Einstein field equation for gravitation can be derived from the Einstein–Hilbert action.[86]: 388\nGeneral relativity\nIn modern physics, general relativity is considered the most successful theory of gravitation.[87] Physicists continue to work to find solutions to the Einstein field equations that form the basis of general relativity and continue to test the theory, finding excellent agreement in all cases.[88][89][90]: p.9\nConstraints\nAny theory of gravity must conform to the requirements of special relativity and experimental observations. Newton's theory of gravity assumes action at a distance and therefore cannot be reconciled with special relativity. The simplest generalization of Newton's approach would be a scalar field theory with the gravitational potential represented by a single number in a 4-dimensional spacetime. However, this type of theory fails to predict gravitational redshift or the deviation of light by matter and gives values for the precession of Mercury which are incorrect. A vector field theory predicts negative energy gravitational waves so it also fails. Furthermore, no theory without curvature in spacetime can be consistent with special relativity. The simplest theory consistent with special relativity and the well-studied observations is general relativity.[91]\nGeneral characteristics\nUnlike Newton's formula with one parameter, G, force in general relativity is terms of 10 numbers formed in to a metric tensor.[30]: 70 In general relativity the effects of gravitation are described in different ways in different frames of reference. In a free-falling or co-moving coordinate system, an object travels in a straight line. In other coordinate systems, the object accelerates and thus is seen to move under a force. The path in spacetime (not 3D space) taken by a free-falling object is called a geodesic and the length of that path as measured by time in the objects frame is the shortest (or rarely the longest) one. Consequently the effect of gravity can be described as curving spacetime. In a weak stationary gravitational field, general relativity reduces to Newton's equations. The corrections introduced by general relativity on Earth are on the order of 1 part in a billion.[30]: 77\nEinstein field equations\nThe Einstein field equations are a system of 10 partial differential equations which describe how matter affects the curvature of spacetime. The system is may be expressed in the form where Gμν is the Einstein tensor, gμν is the metric tensor, Tμν is the stress–energy tensor, Λ is the cosmological constant, is the Newtonian constant of gravitation and is the speed of light.[92] The constant is referred to as the Einst\nDoc 5(Title: eric escape – Loss of planetary atmospheric gases to outer space) - Gauss's law for gravity – Restatement of Newton's law of universal gravitation\n- Gravitational potential – Fundamental study of potential theory\n- Gravitational biology – Effect of gravity on living organisms\n- Newton's laws of motion – Laws in physics about force and motion\n- Standard gravitational parameter – Concept in celestial mechanics\n- Weightlessness – Zero apparent weight, microgravity\nReferences\n- ^ \"dict.cc dictionary :: gravitas :: English-Latin translation\".

Putin also served as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000[e] and again from 2008 to 2012.[f][7] He has been described as the de facto leader of Russia since 2000.[8]\nPutin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He resigned in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, less than four months later in May 2000, was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations on two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018.\nDuring Putin's initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year[9] as a result of economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas.[10][11] Additionally, Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists, re-establishing federal control over the region.[12][13] While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions which together with a drop in oil prices led to the financial crisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war.\nIn February 2022, during his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts into Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes[14] related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war.[15] In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed constitutional amendments into law that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036.[16][17] In March 2024, he was reelected to another term.\nUnder Putin's rule, the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship with a personality cult. His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections.[18][19][20] Russia has consistently received very low scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, The Economist Democracy Index, Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, and the Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index.\nEarly life and education\nPutin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia),[21] the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin, was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.[22][23] Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 durin\nDoc 2(Title: he original on 11 February 2022.

In the course of a generation, he not only short-circuited the transition to democracy in his own country, and in neighboring countries, but set in motion a chain of events that has shattered the transatlantic order that prevailed after World War II. In the global turn against democracy, he has played, at times, the role of figurehead, impish provocateur, and field marshal. We are living in the Age of Vladimir Putin.\nElectoral history\nVladimir Putin has been nominated and elected as President of Russia all five times since 2000, typically under an independent banner. In the most recent 2024 Russian presidential election, Putin achieved 88% of the popular vote.[489] There were reports of irregularities at this election,[490] including ballot stuffing and coercion.[491][492] Russian authorities claimed that in occupied areas of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions,[493] Putin won 88.12% and 92.83% of votes.[494] In Chechnya, Putin won 98.99% of the vote.[64]\nPersonal life\nFamily\nOn 28 July 1983, Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva, and they lived together in East Germany from 1985 to 1990. They have two daughters, Maria Putina, born on 28 April 1985 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and Yekaterina Putina, born on 31 August 1986 in Dresden, East Germany (now Germany).[495]\nAn investigation by Proekt published in November 2020 alleged that Putin has another daughter, Elizaveta, also known as Luiza Rozova,[496] (born in March 2003),[497] with Svetlana Krivonogikh.[4][498] Elizaveta studied in Paris under the name Elizaveta Olegovna Rudnova.[499] In April 2008, the Moskovsky Korrespondent reported that Putin had divorced Lyudmila and was engaged to marry Olympic gold medalist Alina Kabaeva, a former rhythmic gymnast and Russian politician.[2] The story was denied,[2] and the newspaper was shut down shortly thereafter.[3] Putin and Lyudmila continued to make public appearances together as spouses,[500][501] while the status of his relationship with Kabaeva became a topic of speculation.[502]\nOn 6 June 2013, Putin and Lyudmila announced that their marriage was over; on 1 April 2014, the Kremlin confirmed that the divorce had been finalised.[503][504][505] Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to a daughter by Putin in 2015;[506][507] this report was denied.[506] Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to twin sons by Putin in 2019.[5][508] However, in 2022, Swiss media, citing the couple's Swiss gynecologist, wrote that on both occasions Kabaeva gave birth to a boy.[6]\nPutin has two grandsons, born in 2012 and 2017,[509][510] through Maria.[511] He reportedly also has a granddaughter, born in 2017, through Katerina.[512][513] His cousin, Igor Putin, was a director at Moscow-based Master Bank and was accused in a number of money-laundering scandals.[514][515]\nWealth\nOfficial figures released during the legislative election of 2007 put Putin's wealth at approximately 3.7 million rubles (US$280,000) in bank accounts, a private 77.4-square-meter (833 sq ft) apartment in Saint Petersburg, and miscellaneous other assets.[516][517] Putin's reported 2006 income totaled 2 million rubles (approximately $152,000). In 2012, Putin reported an income of 3.6 million rubles ($270,000).[518][519] Putin has been photographed wearing several expensive wristwatches, collectively valued at $700,000, nearly six times his annual salary.[520][521] Putin has been known on occasion to give watches valued at thousands of dollars as gifts, for example a watch identified as a Blancpain to a Siberian boy he met while on vacation in 2009, and another similar watch to a factory worker the same year.[522]\nAccording to Russian opposition politicians and journalists,[523][524] Putin s\nDoc 5(Title: aimed at undermining and hollowing out the US-led international order) - ^ Cohen, Roger (24 December 2022). \"Putin Wants Fealty, and He's Found It in Africa\".

His grandfather, Spiridon Putin, was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.[22][23] Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 durin\nDoc 2(Title: . 1 on the Time's Most Influential People List.[426][427] Forbes ranked him the World's Most Powerful Individual every year from 2013 to 2016.[428] He was ranked the second most powerful individual by Forbes in 2018.[429]) In Germany, the word \"Putinversteher\" (female form \"Putinversteherin\") is a neologism and a political buzzword (Putin + verstehen), which literally translates \"Putin understander\", i.e., \"one who understands Putin\".[430] It is a pejorative reference to politicians and pundits who express empathy to Putin and may also be translated as \"Putin-empathizer\".[431]\nPutinisms\nPutin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms.[432] Many of them were first made during his annual Q&A conferences, where Putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language, often alluding to Russian jokes and folk sayings.[432] Putin sometimes uses Russian criminal jargon (known as \"fenya\" in Russian), albeit not always correctly.[433]\nAssessments\nAssessments of Putin's character as a leader have evolved during his long presidency. His shifting of Russia towards autocracy and weakening of the system of representative government advocated by Boris Yeltsin has met with criticism.[434] Russian dissidents and western leaders now frequently characterise him as a \"dictator\". Others have offered favourable assessments of his impact on Russia.\nOtto von Habsburg, the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary and former Member of the European Parliament, was an early critic of Putin. In a newspaper interview[435] in 2002 and in two speeches[436] in 2003 and 2005, he warned of Putin as an \"international threat\", that he was \"cruel and oppressive\", and a \"stone cold technocrat\".[437]\nPutin was described in 2015 as a \"dictator\" by political opponent Garry Kasparov,[438] and as the \"Tsar of corruption\" in 2016 by opposition activist and blogger Alexei Navalny.[439] He was described as a \"bully\" and \"arrogant\" by former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton,[440][441][442] and as \"self-centered\" by the Dalai Lama.[443] In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a \"raw materials colony\" of China.[444]\nFormer U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger wrote in 2014 that the West has demonized Putin.[445] Egon Krenz, former leader of East Germany, said the Cold War never ended, adding: \"After weak presidents like Gorbachev and Yeltsin, it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin\".[446]\nMany Russians credit Putin for reviving Russia's fortunes.[447] Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while acknowledging the flawed democratic procedures and restrictions on media freedom during the Putin presidency, said that Putin had pulled Russia out of chaos at the end of the Yeltsin years, and that Russians \"must remember that Putin saved Russia from the beginning of a collapse\".[447][448] Chechen Republic head and Putin supporter, Ramzan Kadyrov, stated prior to 2011 that Putin saved both the Chechen people and Russia.[449]\nRussia has suffered democratic backsliding during Putin's tenure.[450] Freedom House has listed Russia as being \"not free\" since 2005.[451] Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy,[452][453][454] citing purges and jailing of political opponents,[455][456] curtailed press freedom,[457][458][459] and the lack of free and fair elections.[460][461][462] In 2004, Freedom House warned that Russia's \"retreat from freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989, when the country was part of the Soviet Union\".[463]\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Russia as \"authoritarian\" since 2011,[464][465] whereas it had previously been considered a \"hybrid regime\" (with \"some form of democratic government\" in place).[466] According to political scientist Larry Diamond,\nDoc 3(Title: w York: Routledge.

In the course of a generation, he not only short-circuited the transition to democracy in his own country, and in neighboring countries, but set in motion a chain of events that has shattered the transatlantic order that prevailed after World War II. In the global turn against democracy, he has played, at times, the role of figurehead, impish provocateur, and field marshal. We are living in the Age of Vladimir Putin.\nElectoral history\nVladimir Putin has been nominated and elected as President of Russia all five times since 2000, typically under an independent banner. In the most recent 2024 Russian presidential election, Putin achieved 88% of the popular vote.[489] There were reports of irregularities at this election,[490] including ballot stuffing and coercion.[491][492] Russian authorities claimed that in occupied areas of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions,[493] Putin won 88.12% and 92.83% of votes.[494] In Chechnya, Putin won 98.99% of the vote.[64]\nPersonal life\nFamily\nOn 28 July 1983, Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva, and they lived together in East Germany from 1985 to 1990. They have two daughters, Maria Putina, born on 28 April 1985 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and Yekaterina Putina, born on 31 August 1986 in Dresden, East Germany (now Germany).[495]\nAn investigation by Proekt published in November 2020 alleged that Putin has another daughter, Elizaveta, also known as Luiza Rozova,[496] (born in March 2003),[497] with Svetlana Krivonogikh.[4][498] Elizaveta studied in Paris under the name Elizaveta Olegovna Rudnova.[499] In April 2008, the Moskovsky Korrespondent reported that Putin had divorced Lyudmila and was engaged to marry Olympic gold medalist Alina Kabaeva, a former rhythmic gymnast and Russian politician.[2] The story was denied,[2] and the newspaper was shut down shortly thereafter.[3] Putin and Lyudmila continued to make public appearances together as spouses,[500][501] while the status of his relationship with Kabaeva became a topic of speculation.[502]\nOn 6 June 2013, Putin and Lyudmila announced that their marriage was over; on 1 April 2014, the Kremlin confirmed that the divorce had been finalised.[503][504][505] Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to a daughter by Putin in 2015;[506][507] this report was denied.[506] Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to twin sons by Putin in 2019.[5][508] However, in 2022, Swiss media, citing the couple's Swiss gynecologist, wrote that on both occasions Kabaeva gave birth to a boy.[6]\nPutin has two grandsons, born in 2012 and 2017,[509][510] through Maria.[511] He reportedly also has a granddaughter, born in 2017, through Katerina.[512][513] His cousin, Igor Putin, was a director at Moscow-based Master Bank and was accused in a number of money-laundering scandals.[514][515]\nWealth\nOfficial figures released during the legislative election of 2007 put Putin's wealth at approximately 3.7 million rubles (US$280,000) in bank accounts, a private 77.4-square-meter (833 sq ft) apartment in Saint Petersburg, and miscellaneous other assets.[516][517] Putin's reported 2006 income totaled 2 million rubles (approximately $152,000). In 2012, Putin reported an income of 3.6 million rubles ($270,000).[518][519] Putin has been photographed wearing several expensive wristwatches, collectively valued at $700,000, nearly six times his annual salary.[520][521] Putin has been known on occasion to give watches valued at thousands of dollars as gifts, for example a watch identified as a Blancpain to a Siberian boy he met while on vacation in 2009, and another similar watch to a factory worker the same year.[522]\nAccording to Russian opposition politicians and journalists,[523][524] Putin s\n</information>\n\n\n\n\n</think>\n\nBased on the information provided, a \"Putin stooge\" likely refers to someone supportive of Putin’s policies and actions, especially those aligned with Putin's authoritarian leadership style. Identifying such a person requires looking at key political supporters or allies who are likely to advocate or follow Putin's agenda.\n\nTo narrow down this identification, we need to look for key political figures who align with Putin's policies:\n\n<search> definition and examples of Putin stooge </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: . 1 on the Time's Most Influential People List.[426][427] Forbes ranked him the World's Most Powerful Individual every year from 2013 to 2016.[428] He was ranked the second most powerful individual by Forbes in 2018.[429]) In Germany, the word \"Putinversteher\" (female form \"Putinversteherin\") is a neologism and a political buzzword (Putin + verstehen), which literally translates \"Putin understander\", i.e., \"one who understands Putin\".[430] It is a pejorative reference to politicians and pundits who express empathy to Putin and may also be translated as \"Putin-empathizer\".[431]\nPutinisms\nPutin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms.[432] Many of them were first made during his annual Q&A conferences, where Putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language, often alluding to Russian jokes and folk sayings.[432] Putin sometimes uses Russian criminal jargon (known as \"fenya\" in Russian), albeit not always correctly.[433]\nAssessments\nAssessments of Putin's character as a leader have evolved during his long presidency. His shifting of Russia towards autocracy and weakening of the system of representative government advocated by Boris Yeltsin has met with criticism.[434] Russian dissidents and western leaders now frequently characterise him as a \"dictator\". Others have offered favourable assessments of his impact on Russia.\nOtto von Habsburg, the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary and former Member of the European Parliament, was an early critic of Putin. In a newspaper interview[435] in 2002 and in two speeches[436] in 2003 and 2005, he warned of Putin as an \"international threat\", that he was \"cruel and oppressive\", and a \"stone cold technocrat\".[437]\nPutin was described in 2015 as a \"dictator\" by political opponent Garry Kasparov,[438] and as the \"Tsar of corruption\" in 2016 by opposition activist and blogger Alexei Navalny.[439] He was described as a \"bully\" and \"arrogant\" by former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton,[440][441][442] and as \"self-centered\" by the Dalai Lama.[443] In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a \"raw materials colony\" of China.[444]\nFormer U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger wrote in 2014 that the West has demonized Putin.[445] Egon Krenz, former leader of East Germany, said the Cold War never ended, adding: \"After weak presidents like Gorbachev and Yeltsin, it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin\".[446]\nMany Russians credit Putin for reviving Russia's fortunes.[447] Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while acknowledging the flawed democratic procedures and restrictions on media freedom during the Putin presidency, said that Putin had pulled Russia out of chaos at the end of the Yeltsin years, and that Russians \"must remember that Putin saved Russia from the beginning of a collapse\".[447][448] Chechen Republic head and Putin supporter, Ramzan Kadyrov, stated prior to 2011 that Putin saved both the Chechen people and Russia.[449]\nRussia has suffered democratic backsliding during Putin's tenure.[450] Freedom House has listed Russia as being \"not free\" since 2005.[451] Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy,[452][453][454] citing purges and jailing of political opponents,[455][456] curtailed press freedom,[457][458][459] and the lack of free and fair elections.[460][461][462] In 2004, Freedom House warned that Russia's \"retreat from freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989, when the country was part of the Soviet Union\".[463]\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Russia as \"authoritarian\" since 2011,[464][465] whereas it had previously been considered a \"hybrid regime\" (with \"some form of democratic government\" in place).[466] According to political scientist Larry Diamond,\nDoc 2(Title: w York: Routledge.

Putin also served as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000[e] and again from 2008 to 2012.[f][7] He has been described as the de facto leader of Russia since 2000.[8]\nPutin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He resigned in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, less than four months later in May 2000, was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations on two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018.\nDuring Putin's initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year[9] as a result of economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas.[10][11] Additionally, Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists, re-establishing federal control over the region.[12][13] While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions which together with a drop in oil prices led to the financial crisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war.\nIn February 2022, during his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts into Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes[14] related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war.[15] In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed constitutional amendments into law that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036.[16][17] In March 2024, he was reelected to another term.\nUnder Putin's rule, the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship with a personality cult. His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections.[18][19][20] Russia has consistently received very low scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, The Economist Democracy Index, Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, and the Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index.\nEarly life and education\nPutin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia),[21] the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin, was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.[22][23] Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 durin\nDoc 4(Title: h as Michael Hirsh, described Putin as a \"messianic\" Russian nationalist and Eurasianist.[485][486][487]) In March 2025, Franklin Foer of The Atlantic said that the 21st century was the \"Age of Vladimir Putin\".[488] Foer wrote that:\nOver the past 25 years, the world has bent to the vision of one man.

It’s little wonder the incoming President might be resisting the lame-duck President’s efforts to make this Russian infraction the one that calls Russia out as a true enemy.\nNow, let’s address the rhetoric from Trump regarding Russia and its leaders. Trump has called Putin a leader for his country and has accepted Putin’s compliments directed at him.\nEach statement directed towards Putin is worth examining, but, for example, Trump got members of the anti-Trump intelligentsia really clutching their pearls when he quipped, \"Russia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by the press.\"\nThe response from Camp Clinton was remarkable. Jake Sullivan, Clinton’s chief foreign policy adviser, said, “This has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national security issue.” But, many of us who followed Clinton’s shameful and illegal handling of highly classified documents and her mysteriously disappearing 30,000-plus emails wondered, “If those emails were harmless, why would Russia finding them create a national security issue?”\nOr, put another way, as Charles Krauthammer observed, “Whether or not [Trump] made [the Russia comments] seriously or not, could have been sarcastic or sort of half sarcastic as a way to plant the idea. The fact is that it leaves the Clinton campaign in a complete contradiction. If these are just private e-mails, then there is nothing to be concerned about. There’s no espionage. There is no danger to national security. I mean, they will discover her yoga lesson schedule.” Indeed.\nEach one of Trump’s statements regarding Russia has been relatively cordial, it’s true.\nBut, whether intentionally or not, some of them, especially this one, appears to have another political meaning, and effect. But, to be sure, categorically none of the comments rises to level of evidence that America’s new Commander in Chief seeks a grand alliance with Moscow. Is it possible, then, if one takes Trump’s statements toward and about Russia within the context of Trump’s overarching themes regarding what America’s standing in the world ought to be and with full view of his stated foreign policy goals, that Trump is doing something far more clever than what people give him credit for? I think so. And that brings me to the last point.\nTrump has consistently argued for investing in and modernizing America’s military. Most importantly, he has identified the employment of nuclear weapons as a major threat he would like to avoid, and recently stated, \"The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”\nHe is absolutely right. The United States has been lowering the number of its nuclear weapons for decades in the hopes that other countries would be motivated to eschew nuclear strength as well. In addition, the United States has allowed its nuclear force to age without adequate modernization. All three legs of the triad—submarines, missiles, and bombers—are due for serious refurbishment if they are to remain safe and offer a credible deterrent. What has kept the United States from maintaining and improving its nuclear force? Fear of provoking the Russian Federation.

Hudson\nNow that same-sex marriage has been legalized in the United States, some say polygamy should be next. After all, they reason, if people can marry whom they wish, they should be able to have more than one spouse. Polls suggest that 16 percent of Americans would accept legalized polygamy. Television shows like \"Sister Wives\" and \"Big Love\" make polygamy seem positively wholesome.\nThose shows are entertaining but unrealistic. Same-sex marriage may be an advance for human rights. Legalizing polygamy would undermine the stability of our society and deeply harm women and children.\nDoc 2(Title: Should Polygamy Be Permitted in the United States?) \ntheir right to equality in marriage? Undoubtedly, the fact that polygamy is illegal in the United States is the greatest contributing factor, as it means that most U.S. citizens have no understanding of how polygamy works, where it is legal, and of the extreme harm it causes to both wives and children. Another factor comes from an accident of litigation: The defense of polygamy arises in the context of criminal prosecutions, as it first did in the Supreme Court’s 1878 decision (_Reynolds v. United States_) finding no First Amendment religious freedom defense to the crime of bigamy by a Mormon. So far, no state has asserted in defense of its prosecution that it must ban polygamy to ensure that women have equal rights in marriage. But perhaps in this new human rights era, where international law is clear and the Supreme Court no longer favors giving husbands superior rights to wives, that will change.\n\nJust how does polygamy violate a wife’s right to equality “of rights and responsibilities . . . as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution” with her husband? Answering this requires thinking about the rights and responsibilities that state law attaches to marriage—when it starts, during its existence, and when it ceases through divorce or death. At the beginning, each person has the right to marry the other; historically, the marriage also operated to sanction sex between the partners. With polygamy, however, the man has the right to marry as many women as he likes, while the woman is limited to one husband. What’s more, the sex lives of the husband and the wife are different: He has sex much more often than she.\n\nTurning to the obligation to support the children, the polygamist husband has fewer responsibilities than each wife does concerning their children. The wives’ time, emotional attention, and financial resources are available to support the children; only a fraction of the husband’s are. The same is true when divorce or death comes. A typical intestate succession statute leaves one-third to a wife and two-thirds to their children, but when a man has four wives, each wife gets a fourth of a third, or one-twelfth, while he inherits one-third from each wife.\n\nThis is not some abstract theory. Polygamy is legal in many nations, and it is these nations’ laws that show how polygamy works in practice. At Georgetown Law, I direct the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic. Clinic faculty and students have worked with African women’s rights lawyers in many different countries investigating the harms caused by legal polygamy. We have interviewed a broad cross-section of the population in Kenya, Namibia, Swaziland, and Tanzania, and in every country the majority of the people spoke movingly about polygamy’s impact on women and children. They spoke of the inability of men to support more than one wife and children. They spoke of jealousy and hatred as the wives and children fought over sparse economic resources and virtually nonexistent emotional support from the one husband and father.\n\nChildren with polygamous fathers spoke longingly about their peers who had monogamous parents; _their_ lives were different, they said, because _both_ of their parents loved them and could afford to send them to school. Wives feared the spread of HIV/AIDS on a continent with the highest rate of infection. They have reason to fear because legal systems permitting polygamy also frequently permit married men to commit adultery, for the new woman may become the new wife. And men who have concurrent sexual relationships spread HIV/AIDS much faster than those in monogamous partnerships.\n\nThis is how life is for those where polygamy is permitted. It is the reason the Human Rights Committee and CEDAW have so resoundingly rejected polygamy as a violation of women’s human right to equality in marriage. For this same reason, it seems extremely unlikely that the U.S. Supreme Court will invalidate \nDoc 3(Title: Should Polygamy Be Permitted in the United States?) \now life is for those where polygamy is permitted. It is the reason the Human Rights Committee and CEDAW have so resoundingly rejected polygamy as a violation of women’s human right to equality in marriage. For this same reason, it seems extremely unlikely that the U.S. Supreme Court will invalidate state criminal statutes prohibiting it, notwithstanding _Sister Wives_ and Kody Brown’s latest move.\n\n### Susan Deller Ross\n\nSusan Deller Ross is a professor of Law and director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic at Georgetown Law; she is also the author of Women’s Human Rights: The International and Comparative Law Casebook _(University of Pennsylvania Press 2008)._\n\nDoc 4(Title: Should Polygamy Be Permitted in the United States?) \nEver since the Supreme Court decided _Lawrence v. Texas_ (539 U.S. 558) in 2003, it has become fashionable among some to argue that the privacy concerns that led to striking down anti-sodomy laws should have the same result for criminal bigamy statutes that prohibit polygamy. Cable TV shows like _Big Love_ and _Sister Wives_ make it seem that polygamy is just another lifestyle that consenting adults should be free to choose. Justice Antonin Scalia’s passionate _Lawrence_ dissent warning that “\\[s\\]tate laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity” were “called into question” by the decision seems to have inspired some to try to reach that precise result. _Id._ at 590.\n\nThe gay couple who wrote _Big Love_ may have felt that by making polygamy seem attractive, they would increase the chances for gay marriage. More recently, Kody Brown, the polygamist of _Sister Wives_, filed a lawsuit asking a federal district court to find the Utah criminal bigamy statute unconstitutional so that he and his illegal “wives” (thus, not wives in the eyes of the law) could return to Utah. He had to file in federal court because the Utah Supreme Court had already twice rejected this argument in 2004 (_Utah v. Green_) and 2006 (_Utah v. Holm_).\n\nThese efforts overlook one key difference between gay marriage and polygamous marriage. One permits equality between two married spouses; the other does not. And that in turn means that allowing polygamy would violate not only the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but also the U.S. obligation under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to “ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.” So important is this right that both the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) have condemned polygamy in no uncertain terms. It should be “definitely abolished,” the Human Rights Committee ruled, because it violates women’s dignity rights and is an “inadmissible discrimination” against them. Similarly, CEDAW notes that it “contravenes a woman’s right to equality with men” and has “such serious emotional and financial consequences for her and her dependents” that it should be prohibited.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled against federal and state laws that give a wife fewer rights than a husband merely because of her sex, just as does a law permitting a husband to practice polygamy. Whether the law is so explicit that it makes the husband “head and master” of the home with the sole right to control property (_Kirchberg v. Feenstra_, 450 U.S. 455 (1981)) or denies a wife benefits awarded automatically to a husband, such as welfare benefits if the wife is unemployed (_Califano v. Westcott_, 443 U.S. 76 (1979)), housing and medical benefits for the wife’s spouse (_Frontiero v. Richardson_, 411 U.S. 677 (1973)), child-care benefits for a surviving spouse (_Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld_, 420 U.S. 636 (1975)), or self-care benefits for a surviving spouse (_Califano v. Goldfarb_, 430 U.S. 199 (1977), and _Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Insurance Company_, 446 U.S. 142 (1980)), the Court has found violations of the Equal Protection Clause. Even when the rule discriminated against husbands, as in a state law requiring only husbands to pay alimony (_Orr v. Orr_, 440 U.S. 268 (1979)), the Court has required equality for husband and wife.\n\nWhy has so little attention been directed to the question of how polygamy denies women their right to equality in marriage? Undoubtedly, the fact that polygamy is illegal in the United States is the greatest contributing factor, as it means that most U.S. citizens have no understanding of how polygamy works, where it is legal, and of the extreme harm it causes to both wives and childr\nDoc 5(Title: currently schools at home) can be accepted and have the freedom to choose the lifestyle that is best for them.12) Of course, decriminalization of polygamy won’t immediately change the American public’s opinion of the practice; acceptance will doubtless be a long time coming, if it happens at all. Some people may worry that legalizing polygamy would facilitate its spread, but legalization may actually reduce the number of polygamists. If those living polygamy are relieved of the threat of prosecution, they will be more likely to relax and allow their children to mingle with the outside world where they can be influenced by mainstream American values.\nAs things stand today, the tighter the law squeezes polygamists, the tighter they hold to their children and their beliefs—and the more polygamist leaders can use fear to control them. Legalizing polygamy and granting plural wives a marriage license will help to protect the vulnerable, reduce the welfare burden on the state, give wives a legal claim to their husband’s income, and create a more constructive relationship between mainstream American culture and polygamous groups.\nNOTES\n- “Polygamy.” West’s Encyclopedia of American Law. 2005.

It was the first (and remains the only) officially authorised and recognised revision of the King James Version in Great Britain. The work was entrusted to over 50 scholars from various denominations in Great Britain. American scholars were invited to co-operate, by correspondence.[1] Its New Testament was published in 1881, its Old Testament in 1885, and its Apocrypha in 1894.[1] The best known of the translation committee members were Brooke Foss Westcott and Fenton John Anthony Hort; their fiercest critics of that period were John William Burgon, George Washington Moon, and George Saintsbury.\nFeatures\n[edit]The New Testament revision company was commissioned in 1870 by the convocation of Canterbury.[2] Their stated aim was \"to adapt King James' version to the present state of the English language without changing the idiom and vocabulary,\" and \"to adapt it to the present standard of Biblical scholarship.\" To those ends, the Greek text that was used to translate the New Testament was believed by most to be of higher reliability than the Textus Receptus. The readings used by the revisers were compiled into a new edition of the Greek Testament by Edwin Palmer.[3]\nThe Revised Version is significant in the history of English Bible translation for many reasons. At the time of the RV's publication, the nearly 300-year-old King James Version was the main Protestant English Bible in Victorian England. The Revised Version, therefore, is regarded as the forerunner of the entire modern translation tradition. It was also considered more accurate than the King James Version in a number of verses.[citation needed]\nNew version\n[edit]The revisers were charged with introducing alterations only if they were deemed necessary to be more accurate and faithful to the original Greek and Hebrew texts. In the New Testament alone more than 30,000 changes were made, over 5,000 on the basis of what were considered better Greek manuscripts. The work was begun in 1879, with the entire work completed in 1885. (The RV Apocrypha came out in 1894.)[1]\nThe 1885 Revised Version was the first post–King James Version modern English Bible to gain popular acceptance.[4] It was used and quoted favorably by ministers, authors, and theologians in the late 1800s and throughout the 1900s, such as Andrew Murray, T. Austin-Sparks, Watchman Nee, H.L. Ellison, F.F. Bruce, and Clarence Larkin, in their works. Other enhancements introduced in the RV include arrangement of the text into paragraphs, formatting Old Testament poetry as indented poetic lines instead of prose, and the inclusion of marginal notes to alert the reader to variations in wording in ancient manuscripts. The Apocrypha in the Revised Version became the first printed edition in English to offer the complete text of Second Esdras, inasmuch as damage to one 9th-century manuscript had caused 70 verses to be omitted from previous editions and printed versions, including the King James Version.\nIn the United States, the Revised Version was adapted and revised as the \"Revised Version, Standard American Edition\" (the American Standard Version) in 1901. It was also known colloquially as the \"American Revised Version\" early on. Then eventually the wording \"American standard Version\" became they accepted normal usage. The American Standard Version of 1901 is very similar to the Revised Version of 1885 in wording and style, with minor variations in wording in the ASV considered to be slightly more accurate. One example being the word \"heavens\" in the plural form in Genesis 1:1, in the American Standard Version, from the Hebrew, whereas in the 1885 Revised Version, it has the singular form \"heaven\" in that verse, as in the KJV. One other noticeable difference is the American Standard Version's much more frequent use of \"Jehovah\" to represent the Tetragrammaton in the \nDoc 2(Title:  of a “rewritten bible” and here Müller uses the nine characteristics singled out by Philip S. Alexander on the basis of Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, Pseudo-Philo’s Book of Biblical Antiquities and Josephus’s Antiquities.) - “Rewritten Bible” texts are narratives following a sequential chronological order;\n- On their face, they are free-standing compositions replicating the form of the biblical books on which they are based;\n- Despite superficial independence of form, these texts are not intended to replace, or to supersede the Bible;\n- “Rewritten Bible” texts cover a substantial portion of the Bible;\n- They retain the biblical order of events but can be very selective in what they represent;\n- The intention is to produce an interpretative reading of Scripture;\n- The narrative form means, in effect, that they can impose only a single interpretation on the original;\n- The narrative form also precludes making clear their exegetical reasoning;\n- “Rewritten Bible” texts draw on non-biblical sources, whether oral or written.\nMüller’s conclusion:\nThis means that rewritten Bible texts, by their very existence, document that the texts they are rewriting have not exclusively been understood as being referential with regard to the events which have really taken place. This would have precluded the freedom of their “rewriters.”\nApparently, they are foremost perceived as theological texts, not so much aiming at information as at preaching.\nPut another way: In their rewriting they intend to mirror the heavenly forces that, according to these authors, are active in their readers’ lives. Thus it is this “truth” and not some “historical” fact, they are aiming at describing. (p. 23, my bold and formatting in all quotations)\nThose who are rewriting the biblical texts relate to the same history and same characters as found in the original texts, but they have an entirely new agenda for their readers. Audiences have changed since the originals were composed. Times have changed. New needs have arisen.\nAuthors are writing for a community that has become accustomed to learning through oral transmission. Even written texts are read to them and expounded orally. As the historical experiences of a community have an impact on the concerns, the problems and stresses facing that community there emerges a need to retell old stories that conform to the community’s evolving needs and interests. That sort of milieu facilitates an ever-changing story from which audiences draw their identity. Thus when we come to the Gospel of Matthew and its rewriting of Mark’s gospel, Müller explains:\n[T]he story of Jesus mirrors the history of [the] author’s Jewish-Christian congregation after the death of Jesus, first in Palestine, where the preaching to Israel becomes less and less important, then — after the Jewish War — in Syria where, after the divorce from the synagogue, it passes on to the mission to the pagan world. (p. 22)\nCompare what many scholars believe was the impulse for the writing of Deuteronomy as a retake on the Mosaic covenant story known from Exodus to Numbers: Deuteronomy repeats the story of Moses in the wilderness but makes changes to the law so that it is relevant for the time of King Josiah. The re-writings introduce changes to make the stories relevant to the new generation.\nI have sometimes used the term “rewritten Bible” so far but since there was no “Bible” (as we understand it) until much later Müller substitutes the term “biblical books” — that is, books that were to become part of later canons — to lessen potential confusion. The question that arises, then, is why and how we can think of the Gospel of Mark as a “biblical book” in the days before any other gospels were written.\nFor Müller the Gospel of Mark was indeed composed as a “biblical rewriting of the Jesus tradition”.\nThus the Gospel of Mark manifests itself as a “biblical” book in the sense that its Jesus story perceives itself as a continuation of the biblical history contained in th\nDoc 3(Title: Click here for the executive summary of this report.) When liberals and their media allies have an agenda to push, they’ll use any tool at hand. The left often rails against the presence of religion in civic life, mocking conservative Christians as “Taliban” agitating for theocracy. But other times, they find faith to be a handy weapon to bludgeon conservatives. And they’ll go so far as to reinterpret and rewrite the Bible to justify any liberal cause, no matter how outrageous.\nIn 2010, MSNBC anchor Melissa Harris-Perry summed up this strategy in her call for “re-imagining the Bible as a tool of progressive social change.” Huffington Post contributor Mike Lux embraced Harris-Perry’s advice, writing that the Bible embodies “all kinds” of “liberal, lefty, progressive values.”\nThe Media Research Center’s Culture and Media Institute analyzed the various ways liberals and the media have used and abused the Bible to mock religion, attack conservatives and justify left-wing policy.\nHarris-Perry’s “re-imagining” of the Bible has become a favorite liberal tactic, as journalists and politicians have cited it to promote socialism, gay marriage, abortion and a host of other progressive policies. Washington Post “On Faith” contributor Anthony Stevens-Arroyo argued that the Bible was the inspiration for Karl Marx’s dictum “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.” Huffington Post contributor Kittredge Cherry claimed Jesus Christ was a homosexual: “Christ lives in every individual of every different shade of sexual orientation and gender identity.” Writer Nynia Chance proclaimed that the Bible supported abortion on RH Reality Check: “there’s times where the Bible states God commands that one [abortion] take place.”\nAcademics and journalists have even actively changed the words and content of the Bible to further their ideology. Anonymous editors created a “Queen James Bible” that “resolves any homophobic interpretations of the Bible.” The media hyped a small papyrus fragment indiscreetly titled the “Gospel of Jesus’ Wife” which claimed Jesus had married and hid evidence that the fragment was a hoax. On “Good Morning America,” ABC’s Elizabeth Vargas even touted the fragment as a “real-life Da Vinci Code.”\nThe entertainment industry also delights in skewering the Christian holy book in order to mock it. The now-canceled show “GCB” carved its own set of 10 Commandments, inverting one Commandment to read: “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s husband… Unless he’s really hot.” Rapper Lil’ Kim’s “10 Commandments” invented new commandments for women “to keep your man whipped.” The twisted cable series “True Blood” created its own Vampire bible with the phrase: “As their flesh shall nourish yours, their blood shall flow within you, for as the beetle nourishes the lark so shall human nourish vampire.”\nWriters, politicians and entertainers have made concerted effort to alter the content and message of the Bible, substituting the gospel of liberalism for the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\nThou Shalt Adopt Radical Economics\nThe Bible of liberalism condemns conservatives as uncaring, unfeeling oppressors of the poor, and exalts progressives as liberators of the downtrodden.\nDemocratic politicians have repeatedly used the Bible to condemn conservative economic principles and policies. President Barack Obama has been the most prominent practitioner of this tactic; he invoked the Biblical passage “I am my brother’s keeper” to justify government policies requiring redistribution of wealth in a March 30, 2012, campaign speech. Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky quoted 1 John 3:17-18 to condemn the GOP budget, saying, “But if anyone has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.” She then asked her Republican opponents, “Why does your budget resolution take away food from the poor?”\nProgressive writ\nDoc 4(Title: Should the Commandments Be Rewritten?) Perhaps I could begin with an interesting question posed recently and an equally interesting answer. The question was, âDonât you think the commandments should be rewritten?â The answer was, âNo, they should be reread.â\nThis may be a good point from which to take off for consideration of some fundamental facts; namely, the commandments of God are there. They come from a divine source. The experience of the ages has proved the need for them, and has proved what happens if they are ignored.\nSo why spend life in the frustration and unhappiness and sorrow and tragedy of trying to rationalize and wave them away?\nBeginning with the Ten Commandments may be as good a place as any. It would be well to read and reread them and not spend life trying to convince ourselves that they really donât mean what they say.\nSome things the commandments say thou shalt not do, and if that is what they say, thatâs what they mean, and thereâs a reason for it.\nSome of them say this you should do, and thereâs a reason for it.\nIt would be interesting sometime to make a list of what our Father in heaven tells us to do and what he tells us not to do. Any parent is faced with the same situation. Any doctor is faced with the same situation.\nEssentially this is what the gospel is: counsel from a living Father who says to his children, âYou have limitless, everlasting possibilities. You also have your freedom. Itâs up to you how you use it. This is what you can become if you take my adviceâand this is what will happen if you donât. The choice is yours.â\nWe all make choices every day. We all have to live with the results of the choices we make.\nItâs just that plain. It isnât a question of quibbling or hairsplitting or arguing about the mysteries or brooding about the things God hasnât yet told us, while neglecting the things he has told us. Letâs stop quarreling with the commandments and the requirements and just face the facts.\nWho knows better than the Creator and Father of us all what is and isnât essential?\nBrilliant men, philosophers and others, have wrestled with these questions through the centuries, and havenât arrived at any answers they can agree on among themselves.\nI have a great respect for scholarship, for education and research, for academic excellence, and for the magnificent accomplishments of sincere and searching men. But I also have great respect for the word of God, and his prophets, and lifeâs purpose; and it comes to a question of where to place our trust.\nI have been privileged to know some of the ablest men on earthâmen of many faiths, many professions, many accomplishments, in nearly 150 countries. But Iâve never known a man who knew enough that I was willing to trust him with my everlasting life.\nSometimes people quibble about the meaning of scripture and rationalize and justify themselves in doing things they well know they shouldnât do. They sometimes say, for example, that âThou shalt not commit adulteryâ doesnât include all the other kinds and degrees of immoral sins and perversions, or that the Word of Wisdom, for example, doesnât catalogue all the substances and brand names and all the products and dope and harmful things that have been discovered or concocted that are not good for men.\nObviously, all of them couldnât be catalogued. In the words of King Benjamin: âAnd finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.â (Mosiah 4:29.)\nThe Lord expects us to use wisdom and common sense and not quibble about what obviously isnât good for the body or mind or spirit or morals of man.

Conclusions about when an alcohol tax increase is appropriate or effective—or by how much a tax should be increased—differ widely, however, depending on which of these perspectives is taken. Policymakers trying to find a balance among the different perspectives must weigh the multiple trade-offs involved when a tax increase is proposed. Considerations include how different drinking populations respond to tax-induced higher alcohol prices, the equity of a tax for all members of society, and the effects of displacement for workers in alcohol-related industries.\nKeywords: sales and excise tax, public policy on AOD, AOD consumption, AOD price, public health, economic cost of AODU (alcohol and other drug use), social cost of AODU, socioeconomic status, employment\nExcept during Prohibition, the taxation of alcohol has been an enduring part of U.S. fiscal policy. Early in the Nation’s history, Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, proposed a whiskey tax to help pay off debts from the Revolutionary War. In support of Hamilton’s proposal, the Philadelphia College of Physicians proffered a combined professional opinion that “a great proportion of the most obstinate, painful, and mortal disorders which affect the human body are produced by distilled spirits” (Slaughter 1986). Congress was persuaded to enact a Federal alcohol tax in 1791, but enforcement met with some resistance. In what became known as the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, about 500 armed farmers in the back country of western Pennsylvania attacked Federal tax collectors in opposition to the tax on the plentiful amounts of whiskey they distilled from their corn crops. The farmers’ rebellion against the tax fizzled when President George Washington ordered troops into the area, however, and the tax stood.\nAlcohol taxation remains controversial today, although not to the extent of armed rebellion. Many people arrive at different conclusions about whether and to what extent alcohol taxation is appropriate, depending on which of the following perspectives they take on the issue:\nPublic health. Contemporary medical science confirms that alcohol abuse1 is a significant public health problem, even if current warnings are not quite as dire as that given by the Philadelphia College of Physicians.\nRevenue generation. Hamilton’s argument that taxes on alcoholic beverages are an attractive source of revenue continues to echo in many State legislatures and congressional hearings.\nEconomic efficiency. Because problem drinkers2 impose costs on others, alcohol taxation may be required to achieve an efficient allocation of resources in society.\nEquity. Many people question the fairness of alcohol taxation that falls more heavily on one population group (e.g., the poor) than on another.\nEmployment. The desirability of alcohol taxation also comes into question because it imposes costs on the workers who produce, distribute, and sell alcoholic beverages.\nRecent research by economists interested in alcohol policy can inform each of these diverse perspectives on alcohol taxation. A fundamental question economists examine is how patterns of alcohol consumption and alcohol problems respond to changes in beverage prices and tax rates. The answer to this question clarifies the potential of alcohol taxation as a measure to improve public health and has important implications for tax-revenue generation as well. A smaller, but growing, body of research uses economic theory and available empirical estimates to analyze alcohol taxes from the efficiency and equity perspectives. Other economics research sheds light on the impact taxation has on employment both in alcohol-related industries and on a national level.\nAfter discussing how alcohol consumption responds to taxation and price changes, this article reviews research relat\nDoc 2(Title: Health benefits of increases in alcohol and cigarette taxes) - PMID: 2684304\n- DOI: 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb00715.x\nHealth benefits of increases in alcohol and cigarette taxes\nAbstract\nExcise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes imposed by the Federal government of the United States have been very stable since 1951. This paper summarizes research that shows that increased taxation, which results in higher prices, would discourage alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. One striking finding is that a policy to raise the Federal excise tax on beer in line with the rate of inflation over the last three decades would cut motor vehicle fatalities of 18 to 20 year olds, many of which are alcohol-related, by about 15%, saving more than 1,000 lives per year. A second is that over 800,000 premature deaths in the cohort of Americans 12 years and older in 1984 would be averted if the Federal excise tax on cigarettes were restored to its real value in 1951.\nPublication types\nMeSH terms\nLinkOut - more resources\nFull Text Sources\nMedical\nDoc 3(Title:  will encourage increased consumption and associated problematic behavior and negative effects on others, thus creating a gap between the full social costs of drinking and the price paid by consumers.) Use of Alcohol Taxes To Eliminate Inefficiency\nTaxes can close this gap, because adding or increasing a tax on alcohol will raise its full purchase price. Furthermore, a higher price will motivate price-responsive consumers to reduce the amount they drink and, consequently, change their alcohol-related behavior. Theoretically, if the magnitudes of the adverse effects that drinkers have on others could be quantified, then analysts could determine a tax just large enough to offset the shortfall between private retail prices—which cover the costs of production, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages—and the full social costs of drinking.\nManning and colleagues (1989, 1991) estimated that the prevailing alcohol tax rates in the mid- to late 1980’s were about one-half of the amount necessary to make up the difference between private and full social costs of drinking; the chief contributor to the remaining gap was the loss of life by innocent bystanders in drinking-related accidents. The researchers’ calculation was incomplete, however, because it treated all drinking as causing uncompensated harm to others. A modified approach to determining an alcohol tax allows for the fact that not all drinking adversely affects others (Pogue and Sgontz 1989; Kenkel 1996). Even so, the revised tax still is higher than the current rates.\nIdeally, society would tax (and hence, penalize) only problem drinking, because nonproblem drinking does not produce a gap between private and social costs. In practice, however, society taxes all alcohol consumption. Although an alcohol tax tends to bring the price paid by heavy or problem drinkers closer to the full social cost of drinking, a tax on nonproblem drinking leads to an efficiency loss, because it raises the price too high for nonproblem drinkers, thus decreasing their alcohol consumption. Adjusting for the differences between problem and nonproblem drinking results in a lower estimate of the “optimal” tax, but this estimate still is higher than the current tax rates for alcohol, especially for beer and wine (Blumberg 1992).\nSuch an adjustment relies heavily on knowing the price elasticities of alcohol consumption. The more responsive to price that nonproblem drinkers are, or the less responsive problem drinkers are, the lower the tax should be when considering the impact of taxing nonproblem drinking for costs it did not generate. If all else is equal, the less that nonproblem drinking changes when the price of alcohol increases, and the more that problem drinking is responsive to price, a tax will be an efficient way to address problem drinking.\nPolicy Implications\nPolicy analysts considering economic efficiency select alcohol taxes that will reduce, but not eliminate, heavy or problem drinking. With such a tax in place, consumers willing to pay the full social cost still can choose to engage in heavy or problem drinking without imposing any net additional costs on the rest of society. In this scenario, the consumer decides what constitutes the “right” level of consumption according to personal preferences, because the benefits of drinking (as the consumer sees them) will just equal the costs of his or her actions to others.\nAlthough this economic rationale results in an “efficient” pattern of alcohol consumption, it does not preclude harm to the drinker or to others. In contrast, public health advocates may want to continue to raise alcohol taxes as long as such tax increases reduce alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. As Cook and Moore (1993b) indicate, no upper limit may exist on the tax needed to improve public health. Even from the perspective of public health, however, very high taxes could be undesirable due to the potential health benefits of moderate drinking. To avoid discouraging\nDoc 4(Title: and local labor market conditions. For alcohol-related industries, the costs of worker displacement following an alcohol tax increase may be smaller or larger than costs estimated for groups of workers in other situations. Additional research focusing on alcohol-related industries could provide more reliable evidence on this point.) Conclusion\nDifferent perspectives on alcohol taxation lead to quite different conclusions about when an increase in an alcohol tax is either appropriate or effective. The substantial effects of problem drinking on others suggest that an alcohol tax could be used to reduce or eliminate what is, in effect, a subsidy to problem drinking. The presence of nonproblem drinking tempers this conclusion, however, and indicates the need to consider the price responsiveness of both problem and nonproblem drinking. For both economic efficiency and public health, a significant price response for problem drinking would allow shifts in alcohol taxation to be an effective public policy instrument. At the same time, a low price response for nonproblem drinking would enhance economic efficiency, because consumption by nonproblem drinkers would not decrease greatly after a tax increase and contribute to an efficiency loss. A low price response for all drinking would help satisfy the revenue generation objective, because the quantity of alcohol consumed would change little and would allow a tax increase to generate maximal revenues. Proposals to raise alcohol taxes also should consider the equity and employment effects that such an increase would have, however.\nThe current literature on the role of price and taxes in alcohol consumption and alcohol problems provides some of the information needed to inform choices about appropriate taxes, although estimates of alcohol price elasticity vary from one study to another. Further research is needed to examine the direct effects of alcohol taxes and prices across all patterns of alcohol consumption, especially problem drinking. In addition, quantifying the differences between the social and private costs of drinking requires more study.\nFootnotes\nThe term “alcohol abuse” in this article encompasses all levels of problem alcohol use and does not refer to a particular diagnostic system.\nIn this article, “problem drinker” and “problem drinking” refer to any type of alcohol use, even on a single occasion, that leads to adverse consequences in health, social, legal, or other life areas.\n“Light,” “moderate,” and “heavy” drinking are not defined consistently in the alcoholism literature. In this article, the terms are used as they are given in the studies cited. Readers are encouraged to consult the original sources for precise definitions.\nAfter adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.\nState-level aggregate data are often considered more reliable than microdata, because they contain objective measurements. The State-level traffic fatality rates examined in many studies, however, include fatalities not caused by drunk driving and exclude numerous cases of drunk driving that did not result in fatalities. Because microdata from surveys of individuals are not subject to the same types of measurement error problems as State-level aggregate data (Kenkel 1993), studying the price responsiveness of alcohol demand using this type of data can provide valuable information for policymakers. In addition, although self-reports of drunk driving are not perfect, they have been found to correlate well with more objective measures (Anda et al. 1987). The most prudent research strategy is to continue to analyze both aggregate data and microdata.\nReferences\n- Anda RF, Remington PL, Dodson DL, DeGuire PJ, Forman MR, Gunn RA.

Does this all sound like a good\n\nidea? or just narcissistic abuse of local power?\n\nPresumably, readers may think that Sheriff\n\nTurnpike is going too far, and that the President\n\nshould not be subject to petty-seeming prosecution.\n\nThus, there is some degree of merit to complaints\n\nthat State prosecutors can go too far when\n\nprosecuting, or persecuting, the President.\n\nHowever, as a counterexample: imagine female\n\nSheriff Billie Joe MacAlister investigating an\n\nallegation that President Y has an underage\n\nparamour in the Sheriff’s county, and that the\n\nPresident recently visited, sexually assaulted (rape\n\nor otherwise), and battered the paramour, and even\n\nthrew their secret “love child” off the Tallahatchee\n\nbridge to hide it, and the affair, from the public.\n\nShould the President really be immune from\n\ncriminal investigation and prosecution? What would\n\nthe victims say?\n\nSome critics may argue that with issues of the\n\nmagnitude of rape or murder, that shame, private or\n\npublic, might drive the President from office, or that\n\ninformal investigation by the news media should be\n\nenough to let the public know what is going on. That\n\nis, these critics might say, criminal investigation\n\nwould be (allegedly) unnecessary. But are their\n\nassertions true? Does every President have shame,\n\nor the willingness to bow to public shaming? And,\n\ncan journalists always do as good a job at\n\ninvestigating as an actual law enforcement agency\n\ncan? Maybe not.\n\nEverything considered, it seems that there should\n\nnot be total presidential immunity from State (or\n\n16\n\nfederal) criminal investigation/prosecution, lest the\n\nSheriff Billie Joes of the Nation be deterred from\n\nfighting serious crimes. However, on a case-by-case\n\nbasis, if necessary, some prosecutions, e.g., for\n\nPresidential littering or speeding (if the speeding\n\ndoes not result in anybody’s de\nDoc 5(Title: usiness Insider.

The country is identified as one of the happiest places in the world by the United Nations.[6][7]) Gene Yaw, a Republican Pennsylvania state senator, recommended a two-year universal public service requirement to promote civility and understanding of what it means to be an American. “We cannot generate enthusiasm for our way of life when less than 2 percent of our population has put forth any effort for our country.” [8]\nSteve Cohen, an attorney and a former member of the board of directors of the United States Naval Institute, and the person who sponsored the 2023 survey cited above that found that 75 percent of young people would now support some kind of mandatory national service, echoed this need for greater national unity. “Sixty-five percent of all those polled think the country is too divided and would benefit from a common experience,” he reported. [55]\nCon Arguments\n(Go to Pro Arguments)Con 1: Volunteerism is a better experience than mandatory service.\nA whopping 80 percent of young Americans are “unfit” to serve in the military in 2023 because of drug use, weight, or other mental and physical ailments.[49]\nConscripting unfit or unwilling people into the military would make the armed forces less efficient. Michael Lind, cofounder and fellow at the New America Foundation, states, “Most members of the military are satisfied with our professional soldiers and do not want to baby-sit teenagers who will leave the military after six months or two years of unsought, compulsory training.” We should not leave our national security to sulky young people who would rather do anything else. [14]\nVolunteers, however, are happier. 28 percent of millennials have volunteered for a total of 1.5 billion community service hours annually. And 26 percent of Gen Z, mostly just young kids at the time of the survey, said they already volunteered and 50 percent would like a job in volunteerism.[29][30]\nThere are limitless volunteer opportunities throughout the country for willing young people to help others and mature into adulthood. For example, since AmeriCorps was founded in 1993, over 800,000 participants have completed more than one billion service hours. Applications outpace funding and capacity, and there are 15 qualified would-be volunteers for every available AmeriCorps spot. [10][11][12][13]\nCon 2: Mandatory service results in draft dodging and an unfair burden on low-income and minority citizens.\n“The Vietnam-era draft. . .drew disproportionately from those of low socioeconomic backgrounds, while the children of the wealthy and influential were able to finagle exceptions.…[D]raft boards across the country were required to call up men with IQ scores below the military’s minimum standards to offset the recruitment deficit caused by college student deferments,” says former Marine Elliot Ackerman. [52]\nThe problem did not begin with the Vietnam War, but with the beginning of the American draft itself, explains Deseret News: “Through the ages, the wealthy sought for ways out, including unjustified medical exemptions, while the poor tended to have few alternatives. The nation’s first draft was during the Civil War. Wealthy draftees at the time could pay someone to substitute for them, or they could pay $300 for an exemption.” [53]\nAny compulsory service programs “will be gamed by the wealthy, the well-connected, the folks with the social capital to figure out how things work—and national service will be set up in a way that serves their ends and reflects their values and preferences,” says Conor Friedersdorf, staff writer at The Atlantic. [32]\nAlso, a period of mandatory service could be a hardship for families and communities that would lose the young people who are already performing service by contributing to household income, babysitting for neighbors, or caring for sick relatives.[33][34]\nCompulsory service would also delay people’s entry into the workforce, resulting in significant lost earnings that for some are de\nDoc 2(Title: Mandatory National Service) Mandatory national service (also called compulsory service) is a requirement, generally issued by the federal government, that people serve in the military or complete other works of service, most often as young people but age requirements vary. Modern propositions for compulsory service in the United States include young Americans serving in the military or working on civilian projects such as teaching in low-income areas, helping seniors, or maintaining infrastructure, among other ideas.[2]\nProposals in the United States to implement compulsory service trace back to the 1800s. Perhaps the most popular early proposal can be found in the novel Looking Backward (1888) by journalist Edward Bellamy. In what would now be called a “utopian fantasy,” Bellamy imagines a society in which mandatory service “is regarded as so absolutely natural and reasonable that the idea of its being compulsory has ceased to be thought of.”[44][45]\nIn 1906 American philosopher and psychologist William James, while arguing for pacifism, suggested the conscription of men for service not in the military but in civic, social, and humanitarian programs:\nThe military ideals of hardihood and discipline would be wrought into the growing fiber of the people; no one would remain blind, as the luxurious classes now are blind, to man’s relations to the globe he lives on and to the permanently sour and hard foundations of his higher life. To coal and iron mines, to freight trains, to fishing fleets in December, to dishwashing, clothes-washing, and window-washing, to road-building and tunnel-making, to foundries and stoke-holes, and to the frames of skyscrapers would our gilded youths be drafted off, according to their choice, to get the childishness knocked out of them, and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas. They would have paid their blood tax, done their own part in the immemorial human warfare against nature; they would tread the earth more proudly, the women would value them more highly, they would be better fathers and teachers of the following generation. [46]\nMore recently, between 2003 and 2013, then-U.S. Representative Charles Rangel (D-NY) made five unsuccessful attempts to pass the Universal National Service Act, which would have required all people in the United States between ages 18 and 42 to either serve in the military or perform civilian service specifically related to national defense. [1][34]\nMost people who hear the phrase “mandatory national service” think of the military draft. Also called conscription, the draft was created during the American Civil War and is one type of mandatory national service. During the Civil War the Union Army draft was controversial, resulting in the Draft Riot of 1863. As Encyclopaedia Britannica explains,\nAlthough laboring people in general supported the Northern war effort, they had no voice in Republican policy and occasionally deserted from the army or refused reenlistment. Because of their low wages, often less than $500 a year, they were particularly antagonized by the federal provision allowing more affluent draftees to buy their way out of the Federal Army for $300. Minor riots occurred in several cities, and when the drawing of names began in New York on July 11, 1863, mobs (mostly of foreign-born, especially Irish, workers) surged onto the streets, assaulting residents, defying police, attacking draft headquarters, and burning buildings. Property damage eventually totaled $1,500,000. [41][42]\nThe draft was suspended with the end of the Civil War in 1865 and was not reinstated until shortly after the United States entered World War I in April 1917. Because the American military only had about 100,000 men, conscription was needed for American participation in the war. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Selective Service Act on May 18, 1917, and about 2.8 million men were drafted.

[1][23]\n“Since people are now free to live and work where they want, one presumes participation in a National Service Program would be mandatory under the threat of a prison sentence,” adds Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy. “A National Service Program that takes two years out of the lives of young people (or others) contravenes the most important part of America, what has drawn people to its shores for centuries—individual liberty.” [24]\nAssessment Quiz\nAfter reading the above debate, take our assessment quiz to test your knowledge of this issue.

Trump, 45th president of the United States, based solely on personality dynamics revealed by his political behavior in office.\nPsychodiagnostically relevant data were collected from biographical sources and media reports of Trump’s postinaugural political behavior from January 20, 2017 until July 2020 and synthesized into a personality profile using the Millon Inventory of Diagnostic Criteria (MIDC), which yields 34 normal and maladaptive personality classifications congruent with DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-5.\nThe personality profile yielded by the MIDC was analyzed in accordance with interpretive guidelines provided in the MIDC and Millon Index of Personality Styles manuals. Trump’s primary personality patterns were found to be Ambitious/self-serving (bordering on exploitative), Dominant/controlling (bordering on aggressive), and Outgoing/gregarious (bordering on impulsive), infused with secondary features of the Dauntless/dissenting pattern. There is suggestive, equivocal evidence of incipient Distrusting/suspicious and Erratic/unstable tendencies emerging during Trump’s time in office.\nAmbitious individuals are bold, competitive, and self-assured; they easily assume leadership roles, expect others to recognize their special qualities, and often act as though entitled. Dominant individuals enjoy the power to direct others and to evoke obedience and respect; they are tough and unsentimental and often make effective leaders. Outgoing individuals are dramatic attention‑getters who thrive on being the center of social events, go out of their way to be popular with others, have confidence in their social abilities, tend to be impulsive and undisciplined, and become easily bored — especially when faced with repetitive or mundane tasks. Dauntless individuals tend to flout tradition, dislike following routine, sometimes act impulsively and irresponsibly, and are inclined to elaborate on or shade the truth and skirt the law.\nTrump’s executive leadership style in office has been bold, competitive, and self-assured (i.e., ambitious); tough and directive (i.e., dominant); impulsive and undisciplined (i.e., outgoing); and disruptively tradition-defying, with an inclination to shade the truth and skirt the law (i.e., dauntless).\nComments\nThe research was conducted at the Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics (USPP), a collaborative faculty–student research program in the psychology of politics at St. John’s University and the College of St. Benedict in Collegeville and St. Joseph, Minnesota, directed by Aubrey Immelman, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology, who specializes in the psychological assessment of presidential candidates and world leaders.\nMore information and updates: http://personality-politics.org/donald-trump-2020\nRelated reports\nVideo summary » https://youtu.be/AdlEwKTv8Ec (9:39)\nThe Political Personality of 2016 Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J.

Federal Election Commission_,\n\n558 U.S. 310 (2010)_,_ is apposite, too, in that its\n\nprotection against oppressive government reminds\n\nus that the President should not be an unpunished\n\noppressor and criminal himself.\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien has lessons not only\n\nre national injunctions (as a Court Member may\n\nhave noted), but also re the danger of letting the\n\nPresident cloak himself in invisibility and arrogance,\n\nif he insists he is above criminal proceedings.\n\nA Biblical view, seeing King David repenting\n\nafter Nathan revealed his sin to him, and the Lord\n\ntelling Ezekiel to warn people of their sins, is\n\nrelevant here.\n\nGiven the current Chief Executive’s proclivities\n\ntowards unlimited power, the current moment is a\n\nstrikingly poor time to further allow him—or all\n\nfuture Presidents—further license.\n\n4\n\nFinally, Shakespeare’s _Coriolanus_ illustrates the\n\nevil and chaos that happen when leaders betray\n\ntheir country’s best interests, and lack of legal\n\nprocess to try those leaders properly makes things\n\neven worse. The Court should take heed.\n\n**ARGUMENT**\n\n**I. NOTES ON CHANGE IN AMICUS PRACTICE:**\n\n**OR, THE SOFT STATISM OF REDUCING**\n\n**AMICUS BRIEFS TO 8000 WORDS**\n\nFirst off, a quick procedural comment or two:\n\nAmicus notes he has had, “for whatever reason”, a\n\nhiatus of some years since writing the Court. He also\n\nnotes that mysteriously, the rules have changed so\n\nthat the average amicus or amica—one who is not\n\npart of a state entity—is now limited to 8000 words,\n\ninstead of the 9000 he/she used to have. Amicus\n\nwonders if this new rationing of core legal and/or\n\npolitical (since law and politics overlap) speech is a\n\ngood idea.\n\n_Inter alia_, state entities, being large, established,\n\nand powerful, have plenty of ways of making\n\nthemselves heard. By contrast, it is, say, the small-\n\ntime country lawyer, writing her first and only brief\n\nto this Court, who may need all 9000 words to make\n\nimportant and complicated arguments to the Court.\n\nMaybe the government amici, not the “little people”,\n\nso to speak, should have been restricted to 8000\n\nwords, Thus, there is arguably a sort of statism, even\n\nif soft statism, in the new 8000-word wall. Perhaps\n\nthe Court can revisit its unnecessary speech-\n\nrationing at some point.\n\n5\n\n(Amicus is not “resentful” of the 8000-word limit;\n\nif he were, then, like Achilles sulking in his tent,\n\nHomer, _The Iliad_, he might have refused even to\n\nwrite this brief, or any amicus brief. But sulking\n\nmay achieve little, so here is Amicus, with his brief.)\n\n…True, some amici may be able to shoehorn their\n\nentire brief into, say, the length of a 17-syllable\n\n_haiku_. This is not always going to happen, though.\n\nEnough on that point for now: speaking of\n\nstatism, far more important forms of statism exist to\n\nbe criticized here, such as the deep state of\n\ncorruption created at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if\n\nthe President is deemed immune to criminal\n\nproceedings during his tenure in office.\n\n**II. NONACCOUNTABILITY FOR CRIMES**\n\n**MAKES THE PRESIDENT A ONE-MAN “DEEP**\n\n**STATE”, WHICH IS UN-AMERICAN**\n\nA theme or “meme” of recent decades, a “urban\n\nlegend” of sorts, has been the ““Deep State””, a\n\npossibly-legendary bunch of sneaky, shadowy D.C.\n\nbureaucrats running everything in secret. Whether\n\nthis umbrageous gang exists or not, what would be\n\neven worse, maybe, is if in open view, one member of\n\nour society is made into a temporary god, or idol, free\n\nfrom criminal investigation or prosecution. Such a\n\nparagon of lawlessness, a perfidious President\n\nbeyond his own society’s limitations, a Nietzschean\n\n“Superman” of sorts—“beyond good and evil”, at\n\nleast in his own troubled mind—, would be a one-\n\nperson “Deep State” incarnate: dark, untouchable,\n\nun-America\n</information>\n\n\n\n\n<search> qualities of Hillary Clinton as a leader </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: By Huge Margin, Americans Say Clinton Is More Qualified, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds, Except For Honesty, She Tops Trump On Key Qualities) Share\nShare\nDoc 2(Title: Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and the Danger of Comparing Leadership Styles) August 3, 2016\nAs leadership spectacles go, the 2016 U.S. presidential election is the equivalent of a Hollywood blockbuster.

Why won't you agree with them and say it was?\nTrump: I agree, I think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement.

You can only ask so many times.\nReporter: Today?\nTrump: I just asked him again. He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election, he did not do what they are saying he did.\nReporter: Do you believe him?\nTrump: Well, look, I can't stand there and argue with him, I would rather have him get out of Syria, I would rather get to work with him on the Ukraine rather than arguing about whether or not ... that whole thing was set up by the Democrats. Look at Podesta, look at all the things that they have done with the phony dossier. Those are the big events. But Putin said he did not do what they said he did. …\nReporter: On election meddling, did you ask him the question?\nTrump: Every time he sees me he says I didn't do that and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\nDoc 2(Title: ll Says\".

His bartending shift at Louie's Bar & Grill in Akron, Ohio was almost over, and the Cleveland Cavaliers were ahead in the first quarter of a pivotal playoff game. It was May 25, near the end of the primary season, and talk had shifted to the presidential election. “Trump is going to make the right moves,” Manno, the son of Italian immigrants and a lifelong Republican, said as he wiped down the bar. “You don’t become a gazillionaire if you don’t know what you’re doing. He’s gotta have something upstairs.” As for Hillary Clinton, Manno said that he didn't want her in the White House. She was untrustworthy and willing to say anything to get elected, he said. And she possessed another, more fundamental shortcoming, Manno added: her gender. “Nothing against women,\" he said, \"but I don’t want a woman president right now.”\nManno laughed and gave a sheepish, that’s-just-how-I-feel shrug. As he turned away, a waitress named Mary Stone quietly offered a different point of view. Though she’s also planning to vote for Trump in the fall, Stone said she could relate to the cultural barriers that Clinton faces as a woman. “Men are still chauvinistic enough to think that women can’t do the same job as them. And I think that’s an issue.”\nHeading into the general election, Clinton has a wide lead over Donald Trump among minority and female voters. But Clinton, who made history last week as the first woman to clinch the nomination of a major U.S. party, has struggled with the one big voting bloc that’s truly up for grabs in 2016: moderate white men. White men also happen to be Trump’s base. If he doesn’t get a record number of them to turn out, it’s hard to see how he wins the presidency. Women, African-Americans, and Latinos will still play a crucial role in the race. They skew Democratic and anti-Trump. If Clinton keeps that coalition together, she can afford to lose some white men. But she can’t afford to lose too many.\nThe Clinton campaign knows this. Clinton spent significant time in the primaries courting white male voters — in particular white, mostly working-class men in the key Rust Belt and Midwestern swing states that usually decide presidential elections. And yet, despite all the effort, the results were abysmal. Clinton lost the overall male vote to Bernie Sanders by an average of 10 points in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin, according to an analysis of exit poll data. She also lost men by double-digits in states as varied as Nevada, Connecticut and Oklahoma. In contrast, she won the male vote by wide margins in states that have large numbers of African-American and Latino voters. In short, white men are the last holdout.\nBrian Brown, a registered Independent, on his motorcycle in downtown Canton, Ohio. Brown said that he thinks Hillary Clinton's gender will be an obstacle for some voters in the general election. \"There will be people who won’t vote for her because she’s a woman,\" Brown said. Right: The white male vote in Canton and other Rust Belt cities and towns will play a large role in the general election.\nFemale candidates have long faced more resistance, and received less support from men and women alike, even though the percentage of people who say they feel comfortable voting for women has gone steadily up. In 1937, just 33 percent of Americans said they would vote for a female presidential candidate, according to Gallup's first poll on the subject. By 2015, that number had climbed to 92 percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.\nObviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voter\nDoc 4(Title: rategy is a massive gamble. On its face it seems like a weird mistake, coming from an accomplished salesman who knows that the customer is always right. The last time Americans elected someone who had never held elected office before, they went with Dwight Eisenhower, a man who entered the race with high name recognition thanks to his role as supreme commander of the Allied Forces during World War II. Trump starred on “The Apprentice.” But anything is possible, so Democrats have to take the threat that he could be elected president — thanks to a wave of support from white men — seriously. “The white male vote is going to decide the race,” John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock, Pa. said. “If Trump can pull Reagan voters, he’s going to win. And we can’t let that happen.”) The Clinton camp is prepared for a grueling general election. In an interview with PBS NewsHour the day after she clinched the Democratic nomination, Clinton said she plans to ignore Trump’s personal attacks against her. But Trump is “attempting to drive wedges between and among Americans,” Clinton added, “and I am not going to stand by and be silent as he tries to do that.” Earlier this year, Priorities USA Action, the main Super PAC backing Clinton, and other organizations began running ads highlighting Trump’s sexist rhetoric. “That will be a continuing part of the race,” said Geoff Garin, a pollster at Priorities USA who served as Clinton’s chief strategist in the final months of her 2008 run for the White House.\nPredicting presidential elections is a fraught enterprise. One of the best models belongs to Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. His research shows that the three deciding factors are a sitting president’s approval rating in the summer months before an election; second-quarter economic growth in an election year; and how many terms the party in power has been in the White House. By those standards, Clinton is in good but not great shape right now. But unforeseen forces exist that can sometimes upend the best prediction models, and Trump is the very definition of an unforeseen force.\nAs Donald Rumsfeld famously said, “there are known knowns,” “known unknowns,” and “unknown unknowns.” Hillary Clinton is a known entity. And it’s clear that Trump needs to outperform Romney by a lot with white men to make up for his historically low level of support from women and non-white voters. Most of his votes will come from Republicans. But Trump is going to make a gendered appeal to independent and Democratic white men as well, and it’s impossible to predict how that will go. We’ve never had a woman at the top of a Democratic or Republican ticket before. Gender is the great known unknown of the 2016 election.\nTo some, the choice between a former first lady, senator and secretary of state and a real estate developer-turned-reality T.V. star will feel like a no-brainer. But for others it won’t be that easy. They’ll have doubts and fears, if they don’t already. They’ll be concerned about Clinton’s policies, her personality, her email server and paid speeches on Wall Street. In the end, a certain percentage of white men aren’t going to vote for Clinton in November, and if it’s a large enough number Clinton is going to lose. And some of those men will not vote for Clinton simply because she’s a woman, though they may not acknowledge that to pollsters or even themselves.\nSign up for the PBS NewsHour Politics Newsletter\nReceive political analysis on Friday from Mark Shields and David Brooks and on Monday from Amy Walter and Tamara Keith.

She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter that this is the first time a major party is picking a woman to be its nominee? Johnny McMahan, 65, a GOP delegate from Arkansas, said he had no problem with a woman being president but some of his friends felt differently. “They say women are too emotional to be president,” McMahan said. Though assailing the opposing candidate is standard fare at political conventions, this year the attacks have transcended policy positions and become intimately personal. The relentless spotlight on an opponent’s supposed criminality is another departure. Republicans maintain Clinton broke the law by sending classified information on her private email server. Trump’s campaign has worked to sow distrust by using vague insinuations against Clinton that are hard to prove or disprove. On Wednesday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort mused that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had “probably” given special information to Bill Clinton that helped his wife avoid criminal charges, during a brief airport meeting that Lynch has acknowledged was a mistake. He said the “Lock her up!” chant punctuating speeches at the conventions “probably reflects the attitude of a lot of people in America.” “They don’t understand why justice wasn’t done,” he said.

Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican.

Research clearly shows that media exposure contributes to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Social media is unfortunately shaping our concept of beauty. With constant exposure to images posted online, it is evident that there is a link to how individuals compare themselves and perceive their own body. There are an estimated 3.6 billion users worldwide on social media, therefore there must be negative and positive effects linked with social media users.) A negative body image can cause unrealistic expectations of how your body should look and can lead to unhealthy eating behaviors and disordered eating. Studies have found a correlation between the time spent on social media and a negative body image. The correlation is especially true when participants were scrolling through appearance-related content, like accounts of a fitness instructor or model on Instagram. Social media images are filled with people presenting the best version of themselves. Social media can then hurt your body image by constantly exposing yourself to the ideal body type, leading to constant comparison of yourself to unrealistic standards. Additionally, photoshop and filters are readily available to users playing into the unrealistic body image.\nHowever, social media can also have positive effects on body image and can promote body positivity. Viewing body-positive content on social media platforms can help individuals become more accepting and appreciative of their bodies. Additionally, social media can connect you with others to build a body-accepting community.\nIt is important to examine ways to use social media in a positive way to avoid a negative body image. It is important to take a break from social media if you feel worse after using it. Additionally, examine who you are following on social media and unfollow accounts if they do not make you feel good. Instead, pay attention to accounts, people, and images that lift you up. Follow accounts that promote body positivity that does not agree with the beauty standards set by society. (A great account to follow to begin your search for body positivity accounts is @realistic.body.therapist on Instagram.) Finding body-positive accounts and joining support groups can help shift your mindset about the ideal body image set by society. Furthermore, you can use your own social media to be an advocate for positive body talk. Shout out to media outlets, retailers, advertisers, and celebrity product endorsers who celebrate and promote natural looks, healthy body size, and diverse body shapes. You can take a stand and refuse to read, view, or listen to media or buy advertised products that do not promote a healthy and diverse body image.\nStudents should also consider participating in The Body Project or More Than Muscles programs offered through Student Counseling Services. These workshops help students develop and maintain a positive body image and are scientifically supported eating disorder prevention programs. Students will get a chance to dive deeper in conversations about the body image ideal set by society and promoted to us by the media.\nFor more information on how media effects body image visit https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/media-eating-disorders.\nDoc 2(Title: Filters and editing can lead to low self-esteem, depression and even body dysmorphic disorder) It’s normal to feel self-conscious about a picture of yourself from time to time, but when does self-judgment go too far?

People with BDD are so consumed by thoughts of their perceived flaws that they may have trouble maintaining a job, be too anxious to leave the house, and deal with depression and substance abuse.\nBut even if you don’t have body dysmorphia, you can still face very real self-esteem concerns that start with or are made worse by what you see on social media.\n“Everybody can feel these things sometimes,” Dr. Byrne clarifies. “Some of the traits that we see in body dysmorphic disorder we also see in people who don’t have this condition.”\nHave you ever looked in the mirror and liked what you saw … but then looked at a photo of yourself and hated it? Dr. Byrne says he often sees this happen in his office, when patients come to see him about their perceived flaws. They’ll look into a mirror and tell him, “Well, you can’t really see it here,” or “It’s not really showing up.”\n“Then, they instinctively pull out their phone and start showing us that their nose is too big or too crooked,” he continues. “That’s an incredible dynamic, to suggest that an image on your phone is more reflective of reality than the actual physical you who’s sitting in the room.”\nOne study of teen girls found that the more time they spend using social media, the more likely they were to experience “body dissatisfaction” and even depression. But teens aren’t the only ones who can have these internal responses to what they see online.\n“Everyone is prone to concerns about their appearance or having certain features they wish they could change,” Dr. Byrne concedes. “From typical concerns about wishing you could look a little different, all the way to the extreme end of body dysmorphic disorder, there are a lot of shades of gray in between.”\nLet’s dig a little deeper into some of the reasons why social media can be so deceptive — and can make you feel so bad.\nThese days, you can easily edit photos to your liking, from simple FaceTune “fixes” to TikTok filters that completely change your features, to nearly undetectable AI tools that can warp the size and shape o\nDoc 3(Title: into some of the reasons why social media can be so deceptive — and can make you feel so bad.) These days, you can easily edit photos to your liking, from simple FaceTune “fixes” to TikTok filters that completely change your features, to nearly undetectable AI tools that can warp the size and shape of your body.\n“We see that filters and editing tools are driving a lot of self-concern and anxiety,” Dr. Byrne says. “When you don’t like the way you look on screen, you can just magically fix it with the swipe of your finger on the screen.”\nOne British report studied 175 people ages 18 to 30. It found that 90% of respondents had used a filter or photo-editing tools to change their photos before posting them online.\nAdvertisement\nThe average American checks their phone 144 times a day, which can mean seeing a lot of your face (and others’) on social media. That constant exposure can take a toll.\n“Even before filters, we started to see that many people believe they look worse than they do,” Dr. Byrne says, “and they care more because they’re subjected to their own imagery all the time on social media platforms.”\nPlus, many of us now work remotely, staring at our own images all day long — not just on social media but also on video calls with colleagues.\n“People are on screens for virtual meetings for hours a day, often with unfavorable viewing angles and poor lighting,” he adds. “Sometimes, people come in saying they need a neck lift, and when we ask what prompted it, they say, ‘I’ve been staring at my neck on Zoom all day.’”\nWhat you see on your phone isn’t actually what others are seeing in real life. And even without filters, technology isn’t always telling you the truth.\nThe mirror-image function (where selfies are backward from the way you actually look) can confuse you into thinking that your face is exaggerated in size and symmetry. And one study found that selfies can distort facial proportions, making your nose look up to 30% larger than it is.\nAdvertisement\n“There are a number of ways that technology introduces cognitive distortions,” Dr. Byrne explains. “For example, we take high-depth professional studio images of our patients — but sometimes, people see that accurate version of themselves on our screen and they get confused and can’t even point out what they think the problem is. They’re basing their self-image on a medium that oftentimes distorts their facial features.”\nThere’s an old saying that “Comparison is the thief of joy,” and nowhere does that seem to be truer than on social media.\nEven in the early 2010s, long before the evolution of today’s filters and photo-editing technology, studies found that using social media (in those days, mostly Facebook) led users to compare themselves and their bodies to other people’s.\n“People are becoming progressively more image-obsessed, and I think that the progression of social media algorithms drives some of that,” Dr. Byrne reflects. “It really is an unhealthy dynamic, especially for young people who are still developing their self-esteem.”\nSo, what’s the solution? Well, as with so many other things in life, there’s no simple way forward.

These disordered behaviours result from the interaction of several factors, including beauty ideals. A significant factor is social media, by which the unrealistic beauty ideals are popularized and may lead to these behaviours. The objectives of this study were, first, to determine the relationship between disordered eating behaviours among female university students and sociocultural factors, such as the use of social network sites, beauty ideals, body satisfaction, body image and the body image desired to achieve and, second, to determine whether there is a sensitive relationship between disordered eating attitudes, addiction to social networks, and testosterone levels as a biological factor. The data (N = 168) was obtained using validated surveys (EAT-26, BSQ, CIPE-a, SNSA) and indirect measures of prenatal testosterone. The data was analysed using chi-square, Student’s t-test, correlation tests and logistic regression tests. The results showed that disordered eating attitudes were linked to self-esteem (p < 0.001), body image (p < 0.001), body desired to achieve (p < 0.001), the use of social media (p < 0.001) and prenatal testosterone (p < 0.01). The findings presented in this study suggest a relationship between body image, body concerns, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating attitudes among college women.\nKeywords: social media, disordered eating behaviours, body image, female, university students\n1. Introduction\nMental health problems have increased, especially among young people, over the last decade [1]. The most common mental problems are behavioural, emotional, and hyperkinetic disorders. Among these illnesses, disordered eating behaviours are rapidly increasing in a short time, especially among young women [2,3]. These disordered attitudes are defined as afflictions in which people suffer severe disruption in their eating behaviours, thoughts and emotions. The people who suffer from these complaints are usually preoccupied with food and weight. In this sense, disordered eating is used to describe a range of irregular eating behaviours that may or may not warrant a diagnosis of a specific disordered eating attitude [4].\nThese disorders usually occur in women in their twenties or during adolescence [3]. People who suffer these disorders usually present altered attitudes, behaviours, weight perception and physical appearance [5]. Moreover, disordered eating behaviours or attitudes are defined as unhealthy or maladaptive eating behaviours, such as restricting or binging and/or purging [6]. These behaviours are not categorized as an eating disorder, though they are considered a phase of diagnosed eating disorders [7].\nThe concern from health care systems is based on the fact that these severe mental disorders usually puts in danger the well-being and health of the people who suffer them [5]. One-third of the women in the world have suffered from these mental problems at some point in their life [6]. If they are inadequately treated, they may develop severe clinical disorders [8]. Moreover, around 1% of the people with these disordered eating attitudes struggle with unhealthy and emotional problems through all their lives [6].\nOut of the population with disordered eating attitudes, 16% of them present overeating, 20% purged by vomiting, and 61% food restraining [9]. These frequencies changed as people aged, with food restriction being more common in older women and vomiting during adolescence [10]. Moreover, recent data have discussed the increase of how the minimum age of the people with disorders is around 12 years of age and decreasing.

What are the most pressing dangers of AI?) As AI systems prove to be increasingly beneficial in real-world applications, they have broadened their reach, causing risks of misuse, overuse, and explicit abuse to proliferate. As AI systems increase in capability and as they are integrated more fully into societal infrastructure, the implications of losing meaningful control over them become more concerning.1 New research efforts are aimed at re-conceptualizing the foundations of the field to make AI systems less reliant on explicit, and easily misspecified, objectives.2 A particularly visible danger is that AI can make it easier to build machines that can spy and even kill at scale. But there are many other important and subtler dangers at present.\nTechno-Solutionism\nOne of the most pressing dangers of AI is techno-solutionism, the view that AI can be seen as a panacea when it is merely a tool.3 As we see more AI advances, the temptation to apply AI decision-making to all societal problems increases. But technology often creates larger problems in the process of solving smaller ones. For example, systems that streamline and automate the application of social services can quickly become rigid and deny access to migrants or others who fall between the cracks.4\nWhen given the choice between algorithms and humans, some believe algorithms will always be the less-biased choice. Yet, in 2018, Amazon found it necessary to discard a proprietary recruiting tool because the historical data it was trained on resulted in a system that was systematically biased against women.5 Automated decision-making can often serve to replicate, exacerbate, and even magnify the same bias we wish it would remedy.\nIndeed, far from being a cure-all, technology can actually create feedback loops that worsen discrimination. Recommendation algorithms, like Google’s page rank, are trained to identify and prioritize the most “relevant” items based on how other users engage with them. As biased users feed the algorithm biased information, it responds with more bias, which informs users’ understandings and deepens their bias, and so on.6 Because all technology is the product of a biased system,7 techno-solutionism’s flaws run deep:8 a creation is limited by the limitations of its creator.\nDangers of Adopting a Statistical Perspective on Justice\nAutomated decision-making may produce skewed results that replicate and amplify existing biases. A potential danger, then, is when the public accepts AI-derived conclusions as certainties. This determinist approach to AI decision-making can have dire implications in both criminal and healthcare settings. AI-driven approaches like PredPol, software originally developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and UCLA that purports to help protect one in 33 US citizens,9 predict when, where, and how crime will occur. A 2016 case study of a US city noted that the approach disproportionately projected crimes in areas with higher populations of non-white and low-income residents.10 When datasets disproportionately represents the lower power members of society, flagrant discrimination is a likely result.\nSentencing decisions are increasingly decided by proprietary algorithms that attempt to assess whether a defendant will commit future crimes, leading to concerns that justice is being outsourced to software.11 As AI becomes increasingly capable of analyzing more and more factors that may correlate with a defendant's perceived risk, courts and society at large may mistake an algorithmic probability for fact. This dangerous reality means that an algorithmic estimate of an individual’s risk to society may be interpreted by others as a near certainty—a misleading outcome even the original tool designers warned against. Even though a statistically driven AI system could be built to report a degree of credence along with every prediction,12 there’s no guarantee that the people using these predictions will make intelligent use of them. T\nDoc 2(Title: Powering the Digital Economy: Opportunities and Risks of Artificial Intelligence in Finance) \ntwork effects, which could increase the financial system’s vulnerability to single points of failure.\n    \n*   ■ The concentration of third-party AI/ML algorithm providers could drive greater homogeneity in risk assessments and credit decisions in the financial sector, which, coupled with rising interconnectedness, could create the conditions for a buildup of systemic risks. The likely concentration of data and growing use of alternative data in AI/ML could result in, respectively, the risk of uniformity (herding) and out-of-sample risk that eventually could lead to systemic risk.\n    \n*   ■ The widespread use of AI/ML could potentially increase procyclicality of financial conditions. For instance, credit underwriting and risk management processes are inherently procyclical, reacting to financial conditions in ways that reinforce and amplify those changes (that is, falling default rates lead to more lending, which can further lower default rates). AI/ML may automate and accelerate the procyclicality and potentially obscure it (due to explainability issues).\n    \n*   ■ Moreover, in the case of a tail risk event, an inaccurate risk assessment and reaction by ML algorithms could quickly amplify and spread the shock throughout the financial system and complicate or even undermine the effectiveness of the policy response.\n    \n*   ■ Challenges in interpretation, sustainability of analytical power, and prediction of models raise the concern that economic policies or market strategies based on these models will be challenging to interpret or predict by the relevant counterparties, creating additional asymmetric information in the market, with an uncertain impact on financial stability.\n    \n*   ■ Finally, regulatory gaps could adversely impact financial stability if technological advances outpace existing regulations. Such advances are often led by providers who may fall outside existing regulatory perimeters.[21](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn21)\n    \n\nThe rapid evolution of AI/ML has led to a range of regulatory responses. While some jurisdictions have taken a more holistic approach to addressing the issues involved (for example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore[22](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn22) and De Nederlandsche Bank[23](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn23)), others have concluded that existing regulations and expectations on good governance are sufficient to address the emerging issues. Whether it is by way of new regulations or existing ones, regulators have generally focused on AI/ML governance frameworks, risk management, internal controls, and better controls over the model and data.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires broad regulatory and collaborative efforts. An adequate policy response requires developing clear minimum standards and guidelines for the sector, coupled with stronger focus on securing the necessary technical skills. Given the inherent interconnectivity of issues related to the deployment of AI/ML systems in the financial sector, collaboration among financial institutions, central banks, financial supervisors, and other stakeholders is important to avoid duplication of work and to help counter potential risks. Many leading jurisdictions in the AI/ML sector have relied on well-articulated national AI strategies for promoting AI/ML development while ensuring that regulatory gaps do not materialize. Annex 3 provides an overview of country approaches to developing AI national strategies.\n\n4\\.

AI/ML-based decisions made by financial institutions may not be easily explainable and could potentially be biased. AI/ML adoption brings in new unique cyber risks and privacy concerns. Financial stability issues could also arise with respect to the robustness of the AI/ML algorithms in the face of structural shifts and increased interconnectedness through widespread reliance on few AI/ML service providers. Chapter 2 explores the adoption of AI/ML in the financial sector and possible associated risks, Chapter 3 discusses related policy concerns, and Chapter 4 provides some conclusions.\n\n[Box 1.](#RA001bx01)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Capabilities**\n\n*   _Forecasting_. Machine learning algorithms are used for forecasting and benefit from using large data sets. They usually perform better than traditional statistical or econometric models.1 In the financial sector, this is used in such areas as credit risk scoring, economic and financial variables forecasting, risk management, and so on.\n    \n*   _Natural language processing_. Artificial intelligence systems can communicate by understanding and generating human language. Boosted by deep learning and statistical models, natural language processing has been used in the financial sector in such applications as chat bots, contract reviewing, and report generation.\n    \n*   _Image recognition_. Facial and signature recognition is being used by some financial institutions and financial technology companies to assist with carrying out certain anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements (for example, the identification and verification of customers for customer due diligence process), and for strengthening systems security.\n    \n*   _Anomaly detection_. Classification algorithms can be applied to detect rare items, outliers, or anomalous data. In the financial sector, insider trading, credit card and insurance fraud detection, and AML/CFT are some of the applications that leverage this capability ([Chandola, Banerjee, and Kumar 2009](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001ref06)).\n    \n\n2\\. Artificial Intelligence in the Financial Sector\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe capability of acquiring large sets of data from the environment and processing it with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is changing the financial sector landscape. AI/ML facilitates enhanced capacity to predict economic, financial, and risk events; reshape financial markets; improve risk management and compliance; strengthen prudential oversight; and equip central banks with new tools to pursue their monetary and macroprudential mandates.\n\n### A. Forecasting\n\nAI/ML systems are used in the financial sector to forecast macro-economic and financial variables, meet customer demands, provide payment capacity, and monitor business conditions. AI/ML models offer flexibility compared to traditional statistical and econometric models, can help explore otherwise hard-to-detect relationships between variables, and amplify the toolkits used by institutions. Evidence suggests that ML methods often outperform linear regression-based methods in forecast accuracy and robustness ([Bolhuis and Rayner 2020](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001ref05)).\n\nWhile the use of AI/ML in forecasting offers benefits, it also poses challenges. Use of nontraditional data (for example, social media data, browsing history, and location data) in AI/ML could be beneficial in finding new relationships between variables. Similarly, by using AI natural language processing (NLP), unstructured data (for example, the information in email texts) can be brought into the forecasting process. However, the use of nontraditional data in financial forecasting raises several concerns, includin\nDoc 5(Title: imination and Risk in the Medical Setting) While personalized medicine is a good potential application of AI, there are dangers. Current business models for AI-based health applications tend to focus on building a single system—for example, a deterioration predictor—that can be sold to many buyers. However, these systems often do not generalize beyond their training data. Even differences in how clinical tests are ordered can throw off predictors, and, over time, a system’s accuracy will often degrade as practices change. Clinicians and administrators are not well-equipped to monitor and manage these issues, and insufficient thought given to the human factors of AI integration has led to oscillation between mistrust of the system (ignoring it) and over-reliance on the system (trusting it even when it is wrong), a central concern of the 2016 AI100 report.\nThese concerns are troubling in general in the high-risk setting that is healthcare, and even more so because marginalized populations—those that already face discrimination from the health system from both structural factors (like lack of access) and scientific factors (like guidelines that were developed from trials on other populations)—may lose even more. Today and in the near future, AI systems built on machine learning are used to determine post-operative personalized pain management plans for some patients and in others to predict the likelihood that an individual will develop breast cancer. AI algorithms are playing a role in decisions concerning distributing organs, vaccines, and other elements of healthcare. Biases in these approaches can have literal life-and-death stakes.\nIn 2019, the story broke that Optum, a health-services algorithm used to determine which patients may benefit from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental racial biases. The system designers ensured that race was precluded from consideration, but they also asked the algorithm to consider the future cost of a patient to the healthcare system.17 While intended to capture a sense of medical severity, this feature in fact served as a proxy for race: controlling for medical needs, care for Black patients averages $1,800 less per year.\nNew technologies are being developed every day to treat serious medical issues. A new algorithm trained to identify melanomas was shown to be more accurate than doctors in a recent study, but the potential for the algorithm to be biased against Black patients is significant as the algorithm was trained using majority light-skinned groups.18 The stakes are especially high for melanoma diagnoses, where the five-year survival rate is 17 percentage points less for Black Americans than white. While technology has the potential to generate quicker diagnoses and thus close this survival gap, a machine-learning algorithm is only as good as its data set. An improperly trained algorithm could do more harm than good for patients at risk, missing cancers altogether or generating false positives. As new algorithms saturate the market with promises of medical miracles, losing sight of the biases ingrained in their outcomes could contribute to a loss of human biodiversity, as individuals who are left out of initial data sets are denied adequate care. While the exact long-term effects of algorithms in healthcare are unknown, their potential for bias replication means any advancement they produce for the population in aggregate—from diagnosis to resource distribution—may come at the expense of the most vulnerable.\n[1] Brian Christian, The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values, W.

And I also want to\n\nrecognize the University of Virginia's Institute of Democracy for more generally\n\nsupporting our efforts to understand what's been happening since the aftermath of\n\nthe presidential election in November.\n\nOur topic today is whether the president can pardon himself. As President Trump\n\nprepares to leave office, can he give himself a presidential pardon? Is that\n\nconstitutional? We want to ask questions about the arguments for and against self-\n\npardoning.

We have with us\n\ntoday three experts in this area. Let me introduce them in the order in which I'll ask\n\nthem to present first.\n\nIs Brian Kalt, who is a professor of law and the Harold Norris faculty scholar at\n\nMichigan State University. His research focuses on structural constitutional law in\n\njuries. His recent publications include the books _Constitutional Cliffhangers, A Legal_\n\n_Guide for Presidents and Their Enemies,_ and, incredibly timely, the book _Unable,_\n\n_The Law, Politics and Limits of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment._\n\nNext in order of presentation is Professor Bernadette Meyler, who is the Carl and\n\nSheila Spaeth Professor of Law, and professor by courtesy in English, and the\n\nAssociate Dean for Research and Intellectual Life at Stanford University.

And then we'll have about 30 minutes for question and answers. If you have a\n\nquestion, please enter it in the Q&A function, which should be at the bottom of your\n\nscreen, and I'll convey those questions to our panelists.\n\nI'm going to start with Brian Kalt, and maybe you can begin by telling us what the\n\npardon power is and what is its basis in the Constitution?\n\n**BRIAN KALT:**\n\nArticle 2 gives the president the power to grant pardons and reprieves for offenses\n\nagainst the United States, except in cases of impeachment. And there aren't a lot\n\nof limits expressed in the text, so it is one of the president's broadest, least limited\n\npowers. It's not subject to congressional authorization, like most of his take care\n\npowers. It's not subject to judicial review. The merits of a pardon, anyway, are not\n\nreviewable in court under \nDoc 2(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \neir spouses. Lots of people care more about their children than they care about\n\nthemselves. If anything is a conflict of interest, it's the possibility of giving a pardon\n\nto your child.\n\nBut the Constitution permits that. There isn't a general principle either broadly or\n\nas to the pardon power that people can't act when their own interests are being\n\naffected.\n\nThe main argument against the president pardoning himself is that would be a\n\nterrible thing. And the hypothetical that people have in mind when they think about\n\nthat is the president has committed a crime and has decided, \"I don't want to have\n\nto go to jail for this.\" And it's certainly true that the pardon power, like any power,\n\ncan be misused.\n\nBut one of the things that people do in law school, and it's a good thing, is learn to\n\nthink about different hypothetical possibilities that may be cut against their initial\n\npresuppositions. So I want to suggest a situation in which it might be quite\n\nreasonable for the president to give a pardon to the president. Suppose that the\n\nPresident of the United States decides to say to a couple of close aides-- and here I\n\nwill demonstrate that I remember Watergate-- \"You should deep six those\n\ndocuments.\"\n\nAnd maybe there's a really good reason to deep six the documents. Maybe they\n\nwould be very embarrassing to the head of another government from which the\n\nUnited States wants something. Maybe deep sixing the documents is a crime in my\n\nhypothetical, but maybe it's not. The law is unclear about this, as it may well be.\n\nAnd maybe the law is unconstitutional because it unduly intrudes into the\n\npresident's control of the executive branch.\n\nSo suppose an act that's a good idea as a policy matter, arguably illegal but\n\narguably legal, in the law, arguably unconstitutional. And the president realizes\n\nthat the incoming president is a very vindictive political opponent of his who would\n\nlove nothing better than to bring a criminal prosecution so as to discredit his\n\npredecessor. That President might think, \"If it were anybody but me, I'd issue a\n\npardon. I'd issue a pardon to the people I told to deep six the document. And\n\nprosecuting me, in addition to being bad for me, would be bad for the country. So\n\nI'm going to pardon everybody, including myself.\"\n\nThat, I think, would be a legitimate use of the pardon power from the standpoint of\n\nits purposes, which include preventing miscarriages of justice and serving the\n\npublic interest. So just as there are misuses of the power for the president to\n\npardon himself, there are good uses of the power. And there's a general principle\n\nabout power, which is it can be misused.\n\nCongress can do things that are entirely lawful and are extremely bad policy or\n\nextremely bad as a matter of moral principle. Congress can launch a war of\n\naggression. Congress can do that-- Congress has done that. That's what the\n\nMexican-American War was. It was entirely constitutional.\n\nSo yes, power can be misused. But it can also be used for good purposes. And the\n\npeople in the federal convention in 1787 realized that the person who was in the\n\nchair was not going to be there forever. They understood that some of his\n\nsuccessors could be people who were not such splendid individuals.\n\nBut they also hoped, I think reasonably, that most of Washington's successors\n\nwould be decent people who had the public interest at heart. And so they gave\n\nthose people power, including the power to pardon themselves, that can be abused\n\nlike any power can be abused, but hoping that it wouldn't normally be abused. Like\n\nmost powers would not be abused.\n\nAnd realizing-- and this is the last point I'll make-- and realizing that the\n\nconsequences of the president pardoning himself for bad reasons would be\n\nnegative, but they generally wouldn't be disastrous or catastrophic. Important thing\n\nto remember-- the president can pardon only for offenses against the United\n\nStates. A lot of the reall\nDoc 3(Title:  Other experts contend that a president cannot pardon himself or herself due to the established legal precedent that no one may be a judge in his own case and the constitutional restriction that a president cannot issue a pardon in relation to impeachment. Richard Nixon did consider a self-pardon in 1974. At that time, the Justice Department produced a memorandum that concluded the president did not have the constitutional power to issue a self-pardon.19 However, constitutional law and interpretation is undetermined in this situation since historical precedent has not been established.) \nDoc 4(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \nples.\n\nAnd so is there a place for that principle as a limit on the pardon power?\n\nAnd I think not. I think the first thing to see is, strictly speaking, the president\n\nwouldn't be a judge in his own case. He's not just applying law when he gives a\n\npardon to anybody, including himself, he's making a policy decision based on\n\nconsiderations of what's good for the country, possibly considerations of mercy to\n\nan individual, considerations of the possibility that there's been a miscarriage of\n\njustice. Those are policy considerations. They're not the same thing. They're similar\n\nto that, but not the same thing that a court does when it's applying law.\n\nSo what we need for to answer this question is a more exact version of, \"Can the\n\npresident be a judge in his own case?\" And that is are there implicit constitutional\n\nprinciples that limit things presidents and other government officials can do, when\n\nthey have a conflict of interest? There there are. There are some explicit provisions\n\nin the Constitution about that. For example, the vice president doesn't preside over\n\nthe impeachment trial of the president because the vice president has a conflict of\n\ninterest in that. And the framers were aware of that. But that's a specific provision.\n\nI think that's an important point about the way the Constitution works. There isn't a\n\ngeneral provision, and there's a reason there isn't a general provision that high\n\nofficers of the government-- especially members of Congress and the president--\n\ncan't make decisions that affect them personally. Rather, the principle of\n\nrepublicanism is the high officials, the legislators, the chief executive, have to live\n\nunder the laws they make. Meaning they're supposed to take into account the\n\neffects on them, as well as on everybody else, of the laws they make.\n\nAnd so, yes, the president can sign or veto a tax bill that's going to have effects on\n\nthe president's taxes, members of Congress can vote on tax bills that are going to\n\nhave effects on their personal taxes. And indeed, the framers certainly\n\ncontemplated that members of Congress probably would have economic interests\n\nthat were quite similar to those of a lot of their constituents, and that was a good\n\nthing. Farm districts would be represented by people who own the farm, districts\n\nwith a lot of commerce would be represented by people who were involved in\n\ncommerce. That was a positive, not a negative.\n\nWhen there's a conflict of interest problem these days, there's a tendency to think\n\nthe solution is for that person who has a conflict to be recused, for somebody else\n\nto act. Basic features of the highest levels of government, notably Congress, is\n\nthere's no substitute for them. If the president's recused, nobody can act. If a\n\nmember of Congress is recused, nobody can act.\n\nAnd so members of Congress are not recused in voting on legislation that might\n\nhave an effect on them personally. The House and Senate have rules, if I\n\nremember right, saying people are supposed to disclose that, but they continue to\n\nparticipate. Because if they don't, their constituents are not represented. If my\n\nrepresentative in the House were recused, I would go unrepresented.\n\nWorse that should happen than that individual should have a conflict of interest. So\n\nthere's not a general constitutional principle against conflicts of interest. And\n\nthere's not a general principle having to do with the pardon power, that it can't\n\naffect the president personally.\n\nPresident Clinton pardoned his half-brother. That was fine. People can give pardons\n\nto those very close to them. Presidents can pardon their children, they can pardon\n\ntheir spouses. Lots of people care more about their children than they care about\n\nthemselves. If anything is a conflict of interest, it's the possibility of giving a pardon\n\nto your child.\n\nBut the Constitution permits that. There isn't a general principle either broadly or\n\nas to the pardon power th\nDoc 5(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \n I'll make-- and realizing that the\n\nconsequences of the president pardoning himself for bad reasons would be\n\nnegative, but they generally wouldn't be disastrous or catastrophic. Important thing\n\nto remember-- the president can pardon only for offenses against the United\n\nStates. A lot of the really bad scenarios involving presidential pardons of the\n\npresident involve conduct that may well violate the law of the state and be\n\nseparately punishable.\n\nSo does the Constitution contemplate bad self-pardons in order to allow a good\n\nthing, good self-pardons? Yes, I think it does. That's the way power works, and\n\nthere's no way around that.\n\n**MICAH**\n\n**SCHWARTZMAN:**\n\nThanks, John.\n\nWe have a lot to talk about. And there are lots and lots of questions. Let me lead off\n\nwith this one, which picks up on what John has been talking about in terms of the\n\nabuse of the pardon power. And this question asks, \"Can a president commit\n\ntreason while in office and pardon him or herself for that crime?\"\n\nI suspect, Brian, that you have thoughts about this. And maybe some responses to\n\nJohn's comments. So let me start with you, and we'll go from there.\n\n**BRIAN KALT:**\n\nSure. Really quickly, I want to respond to one thing that John said. Conflict of\n\ninterest is different from being a judge in your own case. I think John elided the\n\ndistinction between legislative and adjudicative. And if you're doing something in\n\ngeneral, like legislation, then, yeah, that could affect you. But something\n\nadjudicative that's about your own case, not being a judge in your own case means\n\nit's just about you. It's not about everyone and you're part of everyone. It's just\n\nabout you. So I think that's an important distinction, especially because, generally\n\nspeaking, due process principles only really apply to those adjudicative functions\n\nrather than the legislative ones.\n\nAs far as treason is concerned, this question tees up a very important part of the\n\nconstitutional history. So treason is one of the things the president can pardon for.\n\nIt was the basis of the first pardons that George Washington gave to the Whiskey\n\nRebellion defendants.\n\nAnd this troubled people. So when the convention was debating whether the\n\npresident should have a restriction on his power, one of the things they said was he\n\nshouldn't be able to pardon for treason. Or if he pardons for treason, there should\n\nbe more process.\n\nAnd so, Edmund Randolph, in proposing a restriction on pardoning for treason, said\n\nthe president may himself be guilty. The traitors may be his own instrument. And\n\nthe response that drew was, if the president be himself a party to the guilt, he can\n\nbe impeached and prosecuted. That was James Wilson's response. And it carries\n\ntoday. They didn't restrict the pardon power for treason.\n\nEven contemplating that a president might abuse the power-- as John said, power\n\ncan be abused. Even contemplating the president could abuse the power, they\n\nwanted to keep the power broad, so that people like George Washington could use\n\nit for things like the Whiskey Rebellion.\n\nBut no, if the safeguard here is that the president can be impeached and\n\nprosecuted, you'd be relying on a president who's a traitor, who's leading a\n\ntreasonous insurrection and pardoning all of his minions, to not pardon himself.\n\nAnd at best, I think that suggests that they didn't even think that a self-pardon\n\nmight be a thing.\n\nBut reading that back-and-forth in Madison's notes, it suggests that they thought a\n\nself-pardon just wouldn't be a thing. Otherwise, the possibility of hemming in a\n\npresident like that, by prosecuting him, wouldn't have given anyone comfort and\n\nthey would have voted to restrict the pardon power. So, yeah. If the president can\n\npardon himself-- maybe he can, maybe he can't-- but if he can, he can pardon\n\nhimself for treason.\n\n**MICAH**\n\n**SCHWARTZMAN:**\n\nI have a question from the audience. This one is directed to you, Bernie, and it go\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the discussion, it seems there's no explicit prohibition against a president pardoning himself in the Constitution. However, there's an established legal precedent suggesting no one may be a judge in their own case, implying self-pardoning might be unconstitutional. Since there's no clear resolution, I need to confirm if there's a definitive stance.\n<search> Is it constitutional for the President to pardon himself? </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \nUVA LAW | Can the President Pardon Himself?\n\n**UVA LAW | Can the President Pardon Himself?**\n\n**MICAH**\n\n**SCHWARTZMAN:**\n\nWelcome, everyone. My name is Micah Schwartzman. I'm the Director of the Karsh\n\nCenter for Law and Democracy at the University of Virginia School of Law. The\n\nKarsh Center is a nonpartisan legal Institute whose mission is to promote the\n\nunderstanding and appreciation of principles and practices necessary for well-\n\nfunctioning, pluralistic democracy-- including civil discourse, civic engagement and\n\ncitizenship, ethics and integrity in public office, and respect for the rule of law.\n\nI want to thank the Miller Center for sponsoring this program. And I also want to\n\nrecognize the University of Virginia's Institute of Democracy for more generally\n\nsupporting our efforts to understand what's been happening since the aftermath of\n\nthe presidential election in November.\n\nOur topic today is whether the president can pardon himself. As President Trump\n\nprepares to leave office, can he give himself a presidential pardon? Is that\n\nconstitutional? We want to ask questions about the arguments for and against self-\n\npardoning. What does the original meaning of the Constitution say about this\n\nissue? Is there precedent for it?\n\nThis expert panel will focus on the constitutional basis of the pardon power, its\n\nhistory and limits, the relationship between pardoning and impeachment-- which,\n\nof course, has become that much more important this week, and also the legal and\n\npolitical implications of an attempt by the president to self-pardon. We have with us\n\ntoday three experts in this area. Let me introduce them in the order in which I'll ask\n\nthem to present first.\n\nIs Brian Kalt, who is a professor of law and the Harold Norris faculty scholar at\n\nMichigan State University. His research focuses on structural constitutional law in\n\njuries. His recent publications include the books _Constitutional Cliffhangers, A Legal_\n\n_Guide for Presidents and Their Enemies,_ and, incredibly timely, the book _Unable,_\n\n_The Law, Politics and Limits of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment._\n\nNext in order of presentation is Professor Bernadette Meyler, who is the Carl and\n\nSheila Spaeth Professor of Law, and professor by courtesy in English, and the\n\nAssociate Dean for Research and Intellectual Life at Stanford University. She's a\n\nscholar of British and American constitutional law, and of law in the humanities,\n\nand of 2020, Guggenheim fellow in constitutional studies.\n\nAnd we have with us as well my colleague John Harrison, who is the James Madison\n\ndistinguished Professor of Law and the Thomas F. Bergen teaching professor of law\n\nat the University of Virginia School of Law. He joined our faculty after a\n\ndistinguished career with the US Department of Justice, including the Office of\n\nLegal Counsel. He's also served as counselor on international law in the Office of\n\nthe Legal Advisor at the US Department of State.\n\nI'm going to give our panelists about 10 minutes to share some thoughts about the\n\nquestions that I've prompted, and perhaps other ideas and thoughts about this\n\ntopic. And then we'll have about 30 minutes for question and answers. If you have a\n\nquestion, please enter it in the Q&A function, which should be at the bottom of your\n\nscreen, and I'll convey those questions to our panelists.\n\nI'm going to start with Brian Kalt, and maybe you can begin by telling us what the\n\npardon power is and what is its basis in the Constitution?\n\n**BRIAN KALT:**\n\nArticle 2 gives the president the power to grant pardons and reprieves for offenses\n\nagainst the United States, except in cases of impeachment. And there aren't a lot\n\nof limits expressed in the text, so it is one of the president's broadest, least limited\n\npowers. It's not subject to congressional authorization, like most of his take care\n\npowers. It's not subject to judicial review. The merits of a pardon, anyway, are not\n\nreviewable in court under \nDoc 2(Title:  Other experts contend that a president cannot pardon himself or herself due to the established legal precedent that no one may be a judge in his own case and the constitutional restriction that a president cannot issue a pardon in relation to impeachment. Richard Nixon did consider a self-pardon in 1974.

Lots of people care more about their children than they care about\n\nthemselves. If anything is a conflict of interest, it's the possibility of giving a pardon\n\nto your child.\n\nBut the Constitution permits that. There isn't a general principle either broadly or\n\nas to the pardon power that people can't act when their own interests are being\n\naffected.\n\nThe main argument against the president pardoning himself is that would be a\n\nterrible thing. And the hypothetical that people have in mind when they think about\n\nthat is the president has committed a crime and has decided, \"I don't want to have\n\nto go to jail for this.\" And it's certainly true that the pardon power, like any power,\n\ncan be misused.\n\nBut one of the things that people do in law school, and it's a good thing, is learn to\n\nthink about different hypothetical possibilities that may be cut against their initial\n\npresuppositions. So I want to suggest a situation in which it might be quite\n\nreasonable for the president to give a pardon to the president. Suppose that the\n\nPresident of the United States decides to say to a couple of close aides-- and here I\n\nwill demonstrate that I remember Watergate-- \"You should deep six those\n\ndocuments.\"\n\nAnd maybe there's a really good reason to deep six the documents.

Maybe deep sixing the documents is a crime in my\n\nhypothetical, but maybe it's not. The law is unclear about this, as it may well be.\n\nAnd maybe the law is unconstitutional because it unduly intrudes into the\n\npresident's control of the executive branch.\n\nSo suppose an act that's a good idea as a policy matter, arguably illegal but\n\narguably legal, in the law, arguably unconstitutional. And the president realizes\n\nthat the incoming president is a very vindictive political opponent of his who would\n\nlove nothing better than to bring a criminal prosecution so as to discredit his\n\npredecessor. That President might think, \"If it were anybody but me, I'd issue a\n\npardon. I'd issue a pardon to the people I told to deep six the document. And\n\nprosecuting me, in addition to being bad for me, would be bad for the country. So\n\nI'm going to pardon everybody, including myself.\"\n\nThat, I think, would be a legitimate use of the pardon power from the standpoint of\n\nits purposes, which include preventing miscarriages of justice and serving the\n\npublic interest. So just as there are misuses of the power for the president to\n\npardon himself, there are good uses of the power. And there's a general principle\n\nabout power, which is it can be misused.\n\nCongress can do things that are entirely lawful and are extremely bad policy or\n\nextremely bad as a matter of moral principle. Congress can launch a war of\n\naggression. Congress can do that-- Congress has done that. That's what the\n\nMexican-American War was. It was entirely constitutional.\n\nSo yes, power can be misused. But it can also be used for good purposes. And the\n\npeople in the federal convention in 1787 realized that the person who was in the\n\nchair was not going to be there forever. They understood that some of his\n\nsuccessors could be people who were not such splendid individuals.\n\nBut they also hoped, I think reasonably, that most of Washington's successors\n\nwould be decent people who had the public interest at heart. And so they gave\n\nthose people power, including the power to pardon themselves, that can be abused\n\nlike any power can be abused, but hoping that it wouldn't normally be abused. Like\n\nmost powers would not be abused.\n\nAnd realizing-- and this is the last point I'll make-- and realizing that the\n\nconsequences of the president pardoning himself for bad reasons would be\n\nnegative, but they generally wouldn't be disastrous or catastrophic. Important thing\n\nto remember-- the president can pardon only for offenses against the United\n\nStates. A lot of the reall\nDoc 4(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \nthat might\n\nbe causing people to say, well, there's something that you're being pardoned for.\n\nYou did something wrong.\n\nAnd as a result-- and here is the point of verdict-- you don't have to accept a\n\npardon in certain circumstances. And so it was just dicta about practical\n\nperception, not any legal definitive consequence of a pardon. And as a result, we\n\nhave plenty of examples, and John mentioned some.\n\nPlenty of examples of pardons where the president is trying to exonerate someone.\n\nThe president is saying this person did nothing wrong and should be protected.\n\nGovernors, in particular, do this all the time to save people from execution,\n\nperhaps. If you're saying that this person did nothing wrong, what guilt is that\n\nimputing?\n\nSo the imputation of guilt is a practical matter and it depends on how the president\n\ncharacterizes the action. And in any case, it doesn't have any formal legal effect of\n\nimputing guilt. That said, when people get pardoned, it makes them look guilty.\n\nThat's, as a practical matter, something presidents should think about before\n\npardoning someone. But it doesn't have that legal effect.\n\n**BERNADETTE**\n\n**MEYLER:**\n\nI just want to add two small things. One has to do with this idea that the president\n\nmight pardon someone precisely saying they're not guilty. I think that actually has\n\nbeen one of Trump's mechanisms in his prior pardons, that in a way they're\n\nindicting the legal system for certain kinds of crimes that he doesn't believe should\n\nbe crimes, or that he thinks are unjust prosecutions. And so that they're making a\n\npolitical statement in that respect.\n\nBut then secondly, I think that, in terms of the history, yes. Definitely accepting a\n\npardon doesn't mean that you're guilty, but historically, people have often been\n\nreluctant to accept pardons because they feel that it kind of casts shame on them\n\nas an acceptance of guilt. And even in the 19th century, someone agreed to be\n\nexecuted instead of being pardoned because they felt that it was too shameful to\n\nbe pardoned. So I think there is this history where people have been reluctant to\n\naccept pardons because they feel that it implies guilt.\n\n**MICAH**\n\n**SCHWARTZMAN:**\n\nThere are a couple of questions that ask about the possibility of limiting the pardon\n\npower and how that might happen. And then one that asks-- maybe a way of\n\nformulating this question would be to say, if there's a pardon for a crime that hasn't\n\nbeen charged yet, could that pardon be undone by a future president or could\n\nthere be prosecutions that take place afterwards?\n\nSo the broad question is about limitations. Maybe the narrow one is about, can a\n\npardon be undone in the future?\n\n**JOHN**\n\n**HARRISON:**\n\nYeah, I think not. I know of no attempt at the federal level by a subsequent\n\npresident to undo a prior pardon. But I think it would be ineffective. The idea of the\n\npardon, it is, in this respect, like a grant. I think it's unlike a grant in some other\n\nrespects, and so it can be given to oneself.\n\nBut it creates what would be called-- especially in the 18th and 19th century--\n\ninvested right. That is to say it's an irreversible legal act. It washes away guilt.\n\nSupreme Court has used language like that in describing the pardon power. And if\n\nthe guilt has been washed away, it can't be brought back.\n\nAnother principle the Supreme Court has stated is Congress can't interfere with the\n\neffects of the pardon. Whatever those effects are, they come out of the\n\nConstitution. The president can do it and Congress can't undo any of that. And I\n\nthink that's right. I think that comes from this being a power given to the president,\n\nand with no authority in Congress to do anything about it.\n\n**BRIAN KALT:**\n\nI think that-- Oh, go ahead.\n\n**BERNADETTE**\n\n**MEYLER:**\n\nNo, you go ahead, Brian.\n\n**BRIAN KALT:**\n\nThat's right and it's important. US versus Klein, there were a lot of uses of the\n\npardon power that President Johnson used, t\nDoc 5(Title: Can the President Pardon Himself?) \nples.\n\nAnd so is there a place for that principle as a limit on the pardon power?\n\nAnd I think not. I think the first thing to see is, strictly speaking, the president\n\nwouldn't be a judge in his own case. He's not just applying law when he gives a\n\npardon to anybody, including himself, he's making a policy decision based on\n\nconsiderations of what's good for the country, possibly considerations of mercy to\n\nan individual, considerations of the possibility that there's been a miscarriage of\n\njustice. Those are policy considerations. They're not the same thing. They're similar\n\nto that, but not the same thing that a court does when it's applying law.\n\nSo what we need for to answer this question is a more exact version of, \"Can the\n\npresident be a judge in his own case?\" And that is are there implicit constitutional\n\nprinciples that limit things presidents and other government officials can do, when\n\nthey have a conflict of interest?

Astronomers want to study lots of them, but there’s one big problem – black holes are invisible! Since they don’t emit any light, it’s pretty tough to find them lurking in the inky void of space. Fortunately, there are a few different ways we can “see” black holes indirectly by watching how they affect their surroundings.) Speedy stars\nIf you’ve spent some time stargazing, you know what a calm, peaceful place our universe can be. But did you know that a monster is hiding right in the heart of our Milky Way galaxy? Astronomers noticed stars zipping superfast around something we can’t see at the center of the galaxy, about 10 million miles per hour! The stars must be circling a supermassive black hole. No other object would have strong enough gravity to keep them from flying off into space.\nTwo astrophysicists won half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020 for revealing this dark secret. The black hole is truly monstrous, weighing about four million times as much as our Sun! And it seems our home galaxy is no exception – our Hubble Space Telescope has revealed that the hubs of most galaxies contain supermassive black holes.\nShadowy silhouettes\nTechnology has advanced enough that we’ve been able to spot one of these supermassive black holes in a nearby galaxy. In 2019, astronomers took the first-ever picture of a black hole in a galaxy called M87, which is about 55 million light-years away. They used an international network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope. And in 2022, they used the same network of telescopes to reveal the black hole at the center of the Milky Way.\nIn the image, we can see some light from hot gas surrounding a dark shape. While we still can’t see the black hole itself, we can see the “shadow” it casts on the bright backdrop.\nShattered stars\nBlack holes can come in a smaller variety, too. When a massive star runs out of the fuel it uses to shine, it collapses in on itself. These lightweight or “stellar-mass” black holes are a few to hundreds of times as massive as the Sun. They’re scattered throughout the galaxy in the same places where we find stars, since that’s how they began their lives. Some of them started out with a companion star, and so far that’s been our best clue to find them.\nSome black holes steal material from their companion star. As the material falls onto the black hole, it gets superhot and lights up in X-rays. The first confirmed black hole astronomers discovered, called Cygnus X-1, was found this way.\nIf a star comes too close to a supermassive black hole, the effect is even more dramatic! Instead of just siphoning material from the star like a smaller black hole would do, a supermassive black hole will completely tear the star apart into a stream of gas. This is called a tidal disruption event.\nMaking waves\nBut what if two companion stars both turn into black holes? They may eventually collide with each other to form a larger black hole, sending ripples through space-time – the fabric of the cosmos!\nThese ripples, called gravitational waves, travel across space at the speed of light. The waves that reach us are extremely weak because space-time is really stiff.\nThree scientists received the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for using LIGO to observe gravitational waves that were sent out from colliding stellar-mass black holes. Though gravitational waves are hard to detect, they offer a way to find black holes without having to see any light.\nWe’re teaming up with the European Space Agency for a mission called LISA, which stands for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. When it launches in the 2030s, it will detect gravitational waves from merging supermassive black holes – a likely sign of colliding galaxies!\nRogue black holes\nSo we have a few ways to find black holes by seeing stuff that’s close to them. But astronomers think there could be 100 million black holes roaming the galaxy solo.

Rogue black holes\nSo we have a few ways to find black holes by seeing stuff that’s close to them. But astronomers think there could be 100 million black holes roaming the galaxy solo. Fortunately, our Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide a way to “see” these isolated black holes, too.\nRoman will find solitary black holes when they pass in front of more distant stars from our vantage point. The black hole’s gravity will warp the starlight in ways that reveal its presence. In some cases, we can figure out a black hole’s mass and distance this way, and even estimate how fast it’s moving through the galaxy.\nDoc 3(Title: As we investigate our Universe, black holes are some of the most violent and mysterious objects we find. Black holes are collapsed objects of incredible density that exert a gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape. How can we take a picture if it doesn’t emit light?) Our Work\n2,800\nDistance in light years to the nearest known black hole\nScientists at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian led the effort that created the first image of matter near the event horizon of M87’s supermassive black hole using the Event Horizon Telescope. In 2017, eight radio observatories, including the CfA’s Submillimeter Array, were linked to create an Earth-sized interferometer. These observations revealed the strong effects of gravity expected near a black hole and observed matter orbiting at near light speeds. The Event Horizon Telescope opens a new window to extreme physics at the edge of a black hole. Four more observatories, including CfA’s Greenland Telescope, are being added to the array for the next set of black hole images.\nThe Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian works on all aspects of black hole research, across all wavelengths and scales, from the observational to the theoretical.\nNASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory observes the X-rays from the superheated material falling onto the black hole. This high-energy radiation can penetrate obscuring gas and dust, giving us an X-ray view of the action. CfA scientists monitor Sagittarius A* and are currently observing a star, or pair of stars, being shredded by the supermassive black hole.\nThe Black Hole Initiative joins CfA astronomers with other colleagues from Harvard University to form the first center in the world to focus on the study of black holes. The research draws on astronomy, physics, mathematics, history of science, and philosophy to better understand these fascinating objects.\nThe Institute for Theory and Computation also models, among many black hole research topics, the high-energy conditions that occur when gas clouds or stars fall onto a black hole. Scientists have been studying black hole accretion flows for many years using state-of-art numerical simulations, which allow us to properly follow the black hole physics and evolution of magnetic fields.\nGetting the Picture\nThere is a lot we don’t know about black holes. For example, what happens at the center of a black hole? Or, how do the biggest black holes form? And how do these giant black holes and their host galaxies coexist?\nBut this much is clear—you wouldn’t want to see one up close. NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory observes X-rays from material falling into a black hole as it heats up to millions of degrees and the gravity is sufficient to stretch apart an unfortunate passerby in a process known as “spaghettification.”\nAll of the black holes we know about are either a few times more massive than the Sun, or supermassive, millions to billions of times more massive than the Sun. Strangely, we have not found any confirmed medium-sized black holes. The nearest supermassive black hole, known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star) is about four million times the mass of the sun. It is a monster that lurks at the center of the Milky Way and has been observed tearing apart and devouring stars that venture too close. The black hole at the center of the galaxy M87 is even larger, billions of times more massive than the Sun.\nBlack holes themselves are fundamentally unseeable. There’s no way to bring back light from beyond the event horizon—the point at which light itself is irrecoverably lost to the object’s gravity. The only way we know of their existence is to observe their effects on light and other objects. But we are working on a solution to see right up to the event horizon.\nThe Event Horizon Telescope is an Earth-sized virtual telescope called an “interferometer”, created by linking radio telescopes from all over the world. This long baseline allows us to make ultra-hig\nDoc 4(Title: Teachable Moment .) .8 min readTelescopes Get Extraordinary View of Milky Way's Black Hole\nIn the News\nOur home galaxy, the Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center, but we’ve never actually seen it – until now. The Event Horizon Telescope, funded by the National Science Foundation, has released the first image of our galactic black hole, Sagittarius A* (pronounced “Sagittarius A-star” and abbreviated Sgr A*).\nRead on to find out how the image was acquired and learn more about black holes and Sagittarius A*. Then, explore resources to engage learners in the exciting topic of black holes.\nHow Black Holes Work\nA black hole is a location in space with a gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. A black hole’s outer edge, called its event horizon, defines the spherical boundary where the velocity needed to escape exceeds the speed of light. Matter and radiation fall in, but they can’t get out. Because not even light can escape, a black hole is literally black. Contrary to their name’s implication, black holes are not empty. In fact, a black hole contains a great amount of matter packed into a relatively small space. Black holes come in various sizes and can exist throughout space.\nWe can surmise a lot about the origin of black holes from their size. Scientists know how some types of black holes form, yet the formation of others is a mystery. There are three different types of black holes, categorized by their size: stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes.\nStellar-mass black holes are found throughout our Milky Way galaxy and have masses less than about 100 times that of our Sun. They comprise one of the possible endpoints of the lives of high-mass stars. Stars are fueled by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen, which forms helium and other elements deep in their interiors. The outflow of energy from the central regions of the star provides the pressure necessary to keep the star from collapsing under its own weight.\nOnce the fuel in the core of a high-mass star has completely burned out, the star collapses, sometimes producing a supernova explosion that releases an enormous amount of energy, detectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. If the star’s mass is more than about 25 times that of our Sun, a stellar-mass black hole can form.\nIntermediate-mass black holes have masses between about 100 and 100,000 times that of our Sun. Until recently, the existence of intermediate-mass black holes had only been theorized. NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory has identified several intermediate-mass black hole candidates by observing X-rays emitted by the gas surrounding the black hole. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, or LIGO, funded by the National Science Foundation, detected the merger of two stellar-mass black holes with masses 65 and 85 times that of our Sun forming an intermediate-mass black hole of 142 solar masses. (Some of the mass was converted to energy and about nine solar masses were radiated away as gravitational waves.)\nSupermassive black holes contain between a million and a billion times as much mass as a stellar-mass black hole. Scientists are uncertain how supermassive black holes form, but one theory is that they result from the combining of stellar-mass black holes.\nOur local galactic center’s black hole, Sagittarius A*, is a supermassive black hole with a mass of about four million suns, which is fairly small for a supermassive black hole. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and other telescopes have determined that many galaxies have supermassive black holes at their center.\nWhy They're Important\nBlack holes hold allure for everyone from young children to professional astronomers.

So what powers do executive orders have?) An executive order is a directive from the President that has much of the same power as a federal law. Several landmark moments in American history came about directly from the use of executive orders issued from the White House’s desk, including one Supreme Court decision that limited a presidential executive order issued by Harry Truman.\nIn President Trump’s case, his executive order on Obamacare allows federal agencies to “take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the [Affordable Care] act, and prepare to afford the states more flexibility and control to create a more free and open health care market.”\nThe constitutional basis for the executive order is the President’s broad power to issue executive directives. According to the Congressional Research Service, there is no direct “definition of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations in the U.S. Constitution, there is, likewise, no specific provision authorizing their issuance.”\nBut Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests executive powers in the President, makes him the commander in chief, and requires that the President “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Laws can also give additional powers to the President.\nWhile an executive order can have the same effect as a federal law under certain circumstances, Congress can pass a new law to override an executive order, subject to a presidential veto.\nEvery President since George Washington has used the executive order power in various ways. Washington’s first orders were for executive departments to prepare reports for his inspection, and a proclamation about the Thanksgiving holiday. After Washington, other Presidents made significant decisions via executive orders and presidential proclamations.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War using executive orders in 1861. Lincoln cited his powers under the Constitution’s Suspension Clause, which states, “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion and invasion the public safety may require it.”\nSupreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, in his role as a federal circuit judge, ruled that Lincoln’s executive order was unconstitutional in a decision called Ex Parte Merryman. Lincoln and the Union army ignored Taney, and Congress didn’t contest Lincoln’s habeas corpus decisions.\nTwo other executive orders comprised Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln was fearful that the Emancipation Proclamation would be overturned by Congress or the courts after the war’s end, since he justified the proclamation under his wartime powers. The ratification of the 13th Amendment ended that potential controversy.\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt established internment camps during World War II using Executive Order 9066. Roosevelt also used an executive order to create the Works Progress Administration.\nAnd President Harry Truman mandated equal treatment of all members of the armed forces through executive orders. However, Truman also saw one of his key executive orders invalidated by the Supreme Court in 1952, in a watershed moment for the Court that saw it define presidential powers in relation to Congress.\nThe Court ruled in Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer that an executive order putting steel mills during the Korean War under federal control during a strike was invalid. “The President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker,” Justice Hugo Black said in his majority opinion.\nIt was Justice Robert Jackson’s concurring opinion that stated a three-part test of presidential powers that has since been used in arguments involving the executive’s\nDoc 2(Title: Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity) \nhe establishment of the related Office within the Executive Office of the President, pursuant to section 1752 of Public Law 116-283, portions of this order may be modified to enable the NCD to fully execute its duties and responsibilities.  \n    (b)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  \n        (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or  \n        (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.  \n    (c)  This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  \n    (d)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  \n    (e)  Nothing in this order confers authority to interfere with or to direct a criminal or national security investigation, arrest, search, seizure, or disruption operation or to alter a legal restriction that requires an agency to protect information learned in the course of a criminal or national security investigation.\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,  \n    May 12, 2021.\nDoc 3(Title: hat the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker,” Justice Hugo Black said in his majority opinion.) It was Justice Robert Jackson’s concurring opinion that stated a three-part test of presidential powers that has since been used in arguments involving the executive’s overreach of powers.\nJackson said the President’s powers were at their height when he had the direct or implied authorization from Congress to act; at their middle ground – the Zone of Twilight, as he put it, when it was unsure which branch could act; and at their “lowest ebb” when a President acted against the expressed wishes of Congress.\nThe use of executive orders also played a key role in the Civil Rights movement. In 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower used an executive order to put the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and to enforce desegregation in Little Rock. Affirmative action and equal employment opportunity actions were also taken by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson using executive orders.\nPresident Roosevelt issued the most executive orders, according to records at the National Archives. He issued 3,728 orders between 1933 and 1945, as the country dealt with the Great Depression and World War II.\nPresident Truman issued a robust 896 executive orders over almost eight years in office. President Barack Obama issued 277 orders during his presidency. His predecessor, President George W. Bush, issued 291 orders over eight years, while President Bill Clinton had 364 executive orders during his two terms in office.\nThe most-active President in the post-World War II era, in terms of executive orders, was Jimmy Carter, who averaged 80 orders per year during his four-year term.\nDoc 4(Title: Weekly Columns) I’ve heard from thousands of Arkansans who are concerned about President Obama’s executive action to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. I share those concerns because the President’s order is unconstitutional. While Congress works to defund the President’s overreach, a recent court decision by a U.S. District Court Judge has fortunately put the brakes on that plan.\nIn his 123-page decision blocking the President’s immigration policy Judge Andre Hanen wrote, “These changes go beyond mere enforcement or even non-enforcement of this nation’s immigration scheme.”\nThis ruling verifies that when the President moved from enforcement to simply ignoring the law, he clearly overstepped his authority.\nThis is a recurrent pattern by the President. He has arbitrarily changed who has to follow the law, what laws to follow and when. He directed his administration to make changes to our nation’s immigration policy, circumventing Congress and the system of checks and balances clearly defined in the Constitution. The President acknowledged nearly two dozen times that he doesn’t have the authority to grant this executive action before he announced his unilateral plans.\nI was pleased that Arkansas joined 25 other states to challenge this executive overreach. The judicial process is one tool in the fight against this overreach. I also support using the power of the purse to defund these actions.\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) funding expires at the end of February. The House passed a bill that defunds the President’s immigration executive action while funding the rest of the DHS’s responsibilities, but Senate Democrats blocked the bill from even being debated in the senate. Considering the recent court ruling, passing this bill is not an unreasonable request.\nWe face serious threats to our national security. Filibustering this bill leaves our country vulnerable to terrorists. It’s time to stop putting the vital DHS security programs at risk. Senate Democrats should stop protecting this unconstitutional overreach and debate the bill to ensure the safety and security of our nation.\nOur immigration system needs to be fixed but improvements must be made by Congress. We need to secure our borders, enforce the immigration laws we have and hold those people who break the law accountable.\nAmerica continues to be a beacon of hope and attracts people from around the world who are encouraged to live the American Dream. However, we are a nation of laws and everyone must follow those laws or face the consequences. Judge Hanen’s ruling is an important first step in reversing the President’s unconstitutional overreach because even he is not above the law.\nDoc 5(Title: er executive order signed by the president in January.)

The order seeks to rewrite several civil rights laws and weaponize them to require discrimination, and it directs regulation, non-enforcement, and a review of existing enforcement actions.\nApril 23: President Trump issued six education-related executive orders regarding school discipline policies, artificial intelligence, preparing Americans for high-paying skilled trade jobs, HBCUs, reforming accreditation, and foreign influence at American universities. The school discipline order, for example, gives the secretary of education, in consultation with the attorney general, 30 days to issue new school discipline guidance that will undo the important guidance issued during the Obama and Biden administrations.\nApril 24: The Department of Justice asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the president’s discriminatory policy banning all transgender people from joining or continuing to serve in the military to take effect.\nApril 28: President Trump issued an executive order that directs federal resources to promote aggressive policing tactics and further militarize local law enforcement agencies, provides greater protections for law enforcement officers accused of misconduct, and wields threats of possible federal prosecutions for certain activities, including certain “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives.\nApril 28: President Trump issued an executive order that directs the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions that “obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” and to pursue legal remedies and enforcement measures to bring non-compliant jurisdictions into compliance. The order calls for the identification of federal funds that can be suspended or terminated to sanctuary jurisdictions, and it instructs the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to develop mechanisms for eligibility verification in sanctuary jurisdictions to prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal public benefits.\nApril 28: According to reports, all senior civil servants working as managers in the voting section of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division were removed, and attorneys were directed by political appointees to dismiss all active cases.\nApril 28: The Department of the Treasury published in the Federal Register a request for public comment seeking to remove sexual orientation and gender identity from the internal EEO form that employees use to allege discrimination.\nApril 29: The Department of Justice announced that it is withdrawing from a decades-old desegregation consent decree in Louisiana, with Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon claiming that dismissing a remedy against intentional segregation was “righting a historical wrong, freeing the local school district of federal oversight.”\nMay 2: President Trump announced the first judicial nominee of his second term — Whitney Hermandorfer for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Tennessee). The nomination replaces a nominee during the previous administration who had critical civil rights and labor law experience.

Funding mechanisms can influence what is funded indirectly. The government may choose to fund projects that are deemed socially desirable and environmentally acceptable. Public funding indirectly affects what gets produced by withholding funding from projects that are considered offensive or inappropriate.\n\nGiven the historical and constitutional protections around artistic expression and the indirect nature of public funding influencing content through selection processes rather than explicit content censorship, it suggests that politically neutral content is not strictly required by public funding policies alone.\n\n<answer> no </answer>\n\nThe answer is that public funding for the arts does not strictly require politically neutral content based on existing constitutional protections and the indirect nature of influencing content through funding decisions rather than direct censorship.",

In traditionally public spaces set aside for the exchange of ideas, like public parks, the government may not completely ban artistic expression unless it has a compelling interest that cannot be accomplished through less restrictive means. The government may, however, enforce reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, such as requiring performances to take place within certain hours or limiting the size of the audience for purposes of public safety. In the event the government does enforce time, place, and manner restrictions, these elements must be viewpoint neutral and may not censor one opinion and favor another.\nA designated public forum is one that the government has made available for public expression, but has not been traditionally set aside for the free exchange of ideas.\nFor example, a city hall allowing an art exhibit has been held to be a designated public forum. In this context, the government may censor artistic expression based on content only to the extent that such restriction preserves the purpose of the place. Thus, a city hall art exhibition could allow for quiet performances, yet restrict raucous musical groups from performing.\nThe government may completely censor expression in a nonpublic forum, such as a military facility or a mayor’s private office. Even in nonpublic spaces, the restrictions must be reasonable and not an effort to suppress a specific viewpoint while allowing for the expression of others.\nGovernment may use funding to indirectly censor art\nTo the extent that the government funds the arts, it may indirectly censor artists by refusing to finance projects.\nThe federal government did not become significantly involved with sponsoring the arts until it created the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in 1965. In the 1980s, the NEA sparked a public and political uproar when it helped fund exhibits with controversial themes.\nCritics accused the NEA of financing obscenity, and Congress passed an arts funding law in 1990 requiring that public values be considered in awarding grants. The Supreme Court upheld that law in 1998, ruling in National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley (1998) that the government need not subsidize art it considers indecent.\nAlthough Finley does not stand for the proposition that disagreeable art is subject to censorship, it does mean that the government need not sponsor art it finds offensive.\nSimilar to the Finley case, government officials sometimes invoke the government speech doctrine in art display cases.\nFor example, a controversy ensued over a high school student’s painting that was removing from the Capitol Building, because it had anti-police themes and offended some members of Congress.\nThe student artist and the representative who supported the painting challenged the removal in federal court. However, a federal district court judge in Pulphus v. Ayers (D.D.C. 2017) ruled that the art display was a form of government speech largely because the government retained the ability to exercise editorial control over which paintings were displayed.\nThis article was originally published in 2009 and updated in 2017.

And right now, they don’t have those things, and those things have been stripped away. You look at state budgets, you look at city budgets, and you look at federal budgets, and we don’t make those same common investments that we used to. And it’s had an impact. And we shouldn’t pretend that somehow we have been making those same investments. We haven’t been. And there’s been a very specific ideological push not to make those investments. That’s where the argument comes in.\nMR. DIONNE: And if I could follow up, which gets to the underlying problem where we talk, piously, sometimes, about let’s tear down these ideological red/blue barriers, yet when push comes to shove, these things get rejected. How do you change the politics of that? I mean, as you said, Mitch McConnell and John Boehner were unlikely to be watching us -- that actually has a kind of political significance. Not to this event, but in general.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I was suggesting they’re busy right now. They’ve got votes. (Laughter.)\nMR. DIONNE: No, but I think you were saying something else. How do you tear down those barriers? Because you laid out a fairly robust agenda there. And I want to -- forgive me, Arthur and Bob -- but I’m curious, how do you get from here to there?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, part of what happened in our politics and part of what shifted from when Bob was young and he was seeing a genuine community -- there were still class divisions in your small town.\nMR. PUTNAM: True.\nTHE PRESIDENT: There were probably certain clubs or certain activities that were still restricted to the banker’s son as opposed to the janitor’s son. But it was more integrated. Part of what’s happened is, is that elites in a very mobile, globalized world are able to live together, away from folks who are not as wealthy, and so they feel less of a commitment to making those investments.\nIn that sense -- and what used to be racial segregation now mirrors itself in class segregation and this great sorting that’s taking place. Now, that creates its own politics. Right? I mean, there’s some communities where I don’t know -- not only do I not know poor people, I don’t even know people who have trouble paying the bills at the end of the month. I just don’t know those people. And so there’s a less sense of investment in those children. So that’s part of what’s happened.\nBut part of it has also been -- there’s always been a strain in American politics where you’ve got the middle class, and the question has been, who are you mad at, if you’re struggling; if you’re working, but you don’t seem to be getting ahead. And over the last 40 years, sadly, I think there’s been an effort to either make folks mad at folks at the top, or to be mad at folks at the bottom. And I think the effort to suggest that the poor are sponges, leaches, don’t want to work, are lazy, are undeserving, got traction.\nAnd, look, it's still being propagated. I mean, I have to say that if you watch Fox News on a regular basis, it is a constant menu -- they will find folks who make me mad. I don’t know where they find them. (Laughter.) They’re like, I don’t want to work, I just want a free Obama phone -- (laughter) -- or whatever. And that becomes an entire narrative -- right? -- that gets worked up. And very rarely do you hear an interview of a waitress -- which is much more typical -- who’s raising a couple of kids and is doing everything right but still can’t pay the bills.\nAnd so if we’re going to change how John Boehner and Mitch McConnell think, we’re going to have to change how our body politic thinks, which means we’re going to have to change how the media reports on these issues and how people’s impressions o\nDoc 4(Title: In drafting the Constitution, the framers acknowledged the importance of artistic expression, going so far as to define promotion of the “useful arts” as one of government’s purposes.) Despite this early recognition, artistic expression has historically been subject to some measure of direct or indirect censorship in the United States.\nThe First Amendment provides significant protection to artistic expression and, as a result, severely limits the government’s right to censor controversial works in most contexts. Nonetheless, restrictions on the publication of art continues in several contexts.\nThe scope of protection afforded to artistic expression largely depends on the nature of the speech. Artistic expression through the spoken or written word, particularly in the form of political protest or satirical speeches or writings, such as plays or stories, is akin to “pure speech”and is entitled to comprehensive protection.\nBy contrast, art created for commercial purposes or not designed to convey an expressive message (such as nude dancing) is entitled to less protection.\nObscene artistic expression without “serious artistic value” may be censored\nSome artistic expression is subject to censorship based on its content.\nFor example, “obscene” materials may be censored. Legitimate artistic expressions are never, however, considered obscene because in Miller v. California (1973) the Supreme Court excluded materials with “serious artistic value” from the definition of obscenity.\n“Indecent” works, which are less than obscene but make use of patently offensive terms to describe sexuality or bodily functions, may be restricted. In Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation (1978), the Court held that indecent material, particularly in the context of television or radio broadcasts, which cannot be banned entirely under the First Amendment, may be restricted to avoid broadcast during times when children might typically view or hear it.\nExpression that offends others’ rights may be censored\nArtistic expressions that are neither obscene nor indecent may also be censored because they offend the rights of others.\nFor example, defamatory works — those that maliciously harm a person’s character through falsehoods — fall outside the scope of the First Amendment and may be censored.\nBy contrast, the First Amendment does protect obvious satire of a public figure, so such expressions are not subject to censorship. In addition, artistic expressions that break various statutory laws, such as artistic renderings of currency that violate anti-counterfeiting law or works that offend copyright laws, may also be subject to censorship.\nPrior restraint attempts have been unsuccessful\nThe maxim against prior restraint prohibits federal, state, and local governments from requiring a person to seek permission before publishing or speaking.\nThe rationale for placing a heavy burden on the government in this regard is that a ruling denying the right to exhibit or publish a work of art prior to its publication amounts to censorship. In light of this reasoning, attempts by the government to limit expression through prior restraint have largely been unsuccessful.\nPrior restraints have, however, been upheld in some limited forms. For example, courts have held that requiring a movie producer to submit a film for rating prior to showing it publicly is a constitutional exercise of government power despite the strong presumption against the legality of prior restraints.\nGovernment may not censor expression in public forums\nControversy sometimes arises when publicly owned space is used for exhibitions or communication of art. The degree to which the government may censor such expression depends on the nature of the public space.\nIn traditionally public spaces set aside for the exchange of ideas, like public parks, the government may not completely ban artistic expression unless it has a compelling interest that cannot be accomplished through less restrictive m\nDoc 5(Title: The Public and Broadcasting) \n the issues that are referenced, the name of the person or entity purchasing the time, and a list of executives of the sponsoring entity.  \n     \n*   **Sponsorship Identification.**  Section 317 of the Communications Act and Section 73.1212 of the Commission’s rules require stations to ensure that political ads have appropriate sponsorship identification.  Therefore, all ads must identify the entity that is paying for or sponsoring the advertisement.\n\nFor additional information about the political rules, see [https://www.fcc.gov/media/policy/political-programming](https://www.fcc.gov/media/policy/political-programming).\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong><a name=\"OBJECTIONABLE\"></a></strong><h3><a name=\"OBJECTIONABLEPROGRAMMING\"></a>Objectionable Programming</h3><strong></strong></td><td><a href=\"#TOC\"><nobr>Back to Top</nobr></a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n**Programming Inciting “Imminent Lawless Action.”**  The Supreme Court has ruled that the government can curtail speech if it is both: (1) intended to incite or produce “imminent lawless action;” and (2) likely to “incite or produce such action.”  Even when this legal test is met, any review that might lead to a curtailment of speech is generally performed by the appropriate criminal law enforcement authorities, not by the FCC.\n\n**Obscene, Indecent, or Profane Programming.**  Although, for the reasons discussed earlier, the Commission is generally prohibited from regulating broadcast content, the courts have held that the FCC’s regulation of obscene and indecent programming is constitutional because of society’s interest in protecting children from potentially harmful programming and supporting parents’ ability to determine the programming their children will be exposed to at home.\n\n**Obscene Material.**   Obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment and cannot be broadcast at any time. To be obscene, the material must have all of the following three characteristics:\n\n*   An average person, applying contemporary community standards, must find that the material, as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;\n*   The material must depict or describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable law; and\n*   The material, taken as a whole, must lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\n**Indecent Material.**  Indecent material is protected by the First Amendment, so its broadcast cannot constitutionally be prohibited at all times.  However, the courts have upheld Congress' prohibition of the broadcast of indecent material during times of the day when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience, which the Commission has determined to be between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Indecent programming is defined as “language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory organs or activities.” Broadcasts that fall within this definition and are aired between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. may be subject to enforcement action by the FCC.\n\n**Profane Material.**  Profane material also is protected by the First Amendment so its broadcast cannot be outlawed entirely.  The Commission has defined this program matter to include language that is both “so grossly offensive to members of the public who actually hear it as to amount to a nuisance” and is sexual or excretory in nature or derived from such terms.  This material may be the subject of possible Commission enforcement action if it is broadcast within the same time period applicable to indecent programming: between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.\n\n****How to File an Obscenity, Indecency, or Profanity Complaint.****  In order to allow our staff to make a determination of whether complained-of material is actionable, the Commission requires that complainants provide certain information, including:\n\n(1) the date and time of t\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems historically, restrictions on artistic expression have existed, but significant protections exist under the First Amendment, especially for artistic expression that is political protest or satire.

Public funding indirectly affects what gets produced by withholding funding from projects that are considered offensive or inappropriate.\n\nGiven the historical and constitutional protections around artistic expression and the indirect nature of public funding influencing content through selection processes rather than explicit content censorship, it suggests that politically neutral content is not strictly required by public funding policies alone.\n\n<answer> no </answer>\n\nThe answer is that public funding for the arts does not strictly require politically neutral content based on existing constitutional protections and the indirect nature of influencing content through funding decisions rather than direct censorship.",

We try to address this not with sweeping predictions or grand theories, but with mathematical projections that combine techniques standardly used in demography (the study of human populations) with data we have collected in surveys on religion.) Demographers project the growth or shrinkage of populations based on factors such as age, sex, fertility, mortality and migration. For religious populations, projections also need to include data on “switching” – voluntary movement into and out of religious groups. Finally, the shifting sizes of U.S. religious groups depend partly on rates of religious transmission – whether parents pass their religious identity on to their children. In this report, Pew Research Center has incorporated estimates of “intergenerational transmission of religion” into our projections for the first time.\nSwitching rates are estimated based on responses from more than 15,000 adults to two questions posed in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey: “In what religion, if any, were you raised?” and “What is your present religion, if any?” Results were weighted to the Center’s National Public Opinion Reference Survey, conducted by mail and online in 2020. Long-term cohort trends in switching (going back to the 1970s) come from two similar questions in the long-running General Social Survey: “In what religion were you raised?” and “What is your religious preference?”\nShifts in religious identity, or switching, are concentrated among young adults. During earlier childhood years, a parent’s religion (or lack thereof) is often, but not always, transmitted to a child. Rates of transmission for three identity categories (Christian, other religion, and religiously unaffiliated) are estimated based on the percentages of teens (ages 13 to 17) who shared their mother’s religious affiliation in a 2019 survey of 1,811 pairs of U.S. parents and teens. These observed patterns are used to model whether future generations of newborn children inherit their mother’s religion.\nGroup differences in fertility (the number of children women tend to have), migration and age structures also drive change. Fertility differences by religion are based on the National Survey of Family Growth, while the average U.S. fertility rate used in each period is based on the 2019 revision of United Nations World Populations Prospect data. Migration data comes from the UN. Religious composition by age and sex groups is based on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel. We estimate the religious composition of children based on the religious composition of young adults, and fertility patterns.\nThe various input data is used in projection models to illustrate what the future religious composition of the U.S. might look like under a range of hypothetical scenarios. See Methodology for more information on inputs and modeling.\nSince the 1990s, large numbers of Americans have left Christianity to join the growing ranks of U.S. adults who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular.” This accelerating trend is reshaping the U.S. religious landscape, leading many people to wonder what the future of religion in America might look like.\nWhat if Christians keep leaving religion at the same rate observed in recent years? What if the pace of religious switching continues to accelerate? What if switching were to stop, but other demographic trends – such as migration, births and deaths – were to continue at current rates? To help answer such questions, Pew Research Center has modeled several hypothetical scenarios describing how the U.S. religious landscape might change over the next half century.\nThe Center estimates that in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones,” acc\nDoc 2(Title: n that hypothetical situation, the religious makeup of the U.S. population would continue to shift gradually, primarily as a result of Christians being older than other groups, on average, and the unaffiliated being younger, with a larger share of their population of childbearing age.) Outcome: If switching had stopped altogether in 2020, the share of Christians would still decline by 10 percentage points over 50 years, reaching 54% in 2070. The unaffiliated would remain a substantial minority, at 34%.\nWhich scenario is most plausible?\nThe scenarios in this report present a wide range of assumptions and outcomes. Readers may wonder which scenario is most plausible. While there are endless possibilities that would lead to religious composition change that is different from the plotted trajectories, it may be helpful to consider how closely the hypothetical switching scenarios adhere to real, observed trends.\nThe “no switching” scenario (No. 4) is not realistic – switching has not ended and there is no reason to think it will come to an abrupt stop. The purpose of this scenario is to show the influence of demographic factors (such as age and fertility) on religious affiliation rates. Still, if fewer future young adults switch from Christianity to no affiliation, or if movement in the opposite direction increases, the future religious landscape might resemble the results of this projection.\nThe “steady switching” scenario (No. 1) is conservative. It depicts moderate, steady “net” switching (taking into consideration some partially offsetting movement in both directions) away from Christianity among young adults for the foreseeable future, rather than the extension of a decades-long trend of increasing disaffiliation across younger cohorts. Even long-standing trends can be unsustainable or otherwise temporary, and this scenario best represents what would happen if the recent period of rising attrition from Christianity is winding down or already has ended.\nBy contrast, the scenario of rising disaffiliation without limits (No. 3) assumes there is a kind of ever-increasing momentum behind religious switching. The visible rise of the unaffiliated might induce more and more young people to leave Christianity and further increase the “stickiness” of an unaffiliated upbringing, so that fewer and fewer people raised without a religion would take on a religious identity at a later point in their lives.\nIntergenerational transmission is the passing of religious identity from parents to children. It occurs (or fails to occur) in childhood. In this study, transmission rates are calculated based on the share of children who inherit their mother’s religion (or their mother’s unaffiliated identity) because mothers tend to successfully transmit their religious identities more often than fathers do. Also, roughly a quarter of children under 18 live in single-parent households, which are overwhelmingly headed by mothers.\nThe Center’s data shows the vast majority of teens (about 85%) have the same religious identity as their mother, while 16% report a different identity. Religious transmission, as measured in this study, can fail to occur for many reasons and in either direction. For example, if a mother doesn’t identify with any religion but her 14-year-old child identifies as Christian, it’s counted as a non-transmission of religious identity – just as it would for a Christian mother with a religiously unaffiliated teen.\nIntergenerational transmission differs from switching because it describes what happens before the age of 15 and is measured by comparing the religious affiliation of mothers with the affiliations reported by their teenage children. Switching, by contrast, describes a change that happens after the age of 15; it is measured by comparing the religions in which respondents say they were raised with the affiliations they report today.\nOn the other hand, highly religious parents tend to raise highly religious children who are less like\nDoc 3(Title: Abstract) This paper analyzes four trends that are affecting the 2016 election: changing US demographics and the reaction to them, a growing distrust of government, increased polarization and government gridlock, and the rise of populism. It compares the views of candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald S. Trump on the Affordable Care Act, climate change, prescription drug pricing, prevention of injuries and deaths from firearms, and the opioids epidemic; and offers perspectives on the potential impact of the election not only on U.S. health care policy, but on the health of American democracy itself.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis manuscript is based on the Betty and Herb Dupont Lecture at the Americal Clinical and Climatological Association on October 22, 2016. For the lecture, I conducted an extensive evidence review, mainly through Google, on the trends influencing the 2016 election, and on the election’s potential impact on US health care policy. This manuscript describes the findings of my evidence review, interprets and analyzes them, and offers perspectives on the implications not only for US health care but also the health of American democracy. Because the lecture took place prior to the November 8 election, this paper does not specifically comment on the results of the election, although the perspectives offered on how Donald S. Trump’s positions as a candidate, compared to those of former Secretary of State Hillary R. Rodham, are relevant to any conversation about what Mr. Trump’s election and continued Republican control of Congress bodes for health care policy.\nINTRODUCTION\nHunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, which chronicled the 1972 Nixon versus McGovern campaign, was described by the New York Times as “the best account yet published” of a modern American presidential campaign (1). “What makes the story so painful, and so painfully funny” writes Matt Taibbi in his introduction to the book’s 40th anniversary edition, “is that Hunter chooses the presidential campaign, of all places, to conduct this hopeless search for truth and justice. It’s probably worse now than it was in Hunter’s day, but the American presidential campaign is the last place in the world a sane man would go in search of anything like honesty. It may be the most fake place on earth” (2).\nThe same might be said of the 2016 election; an election characterized by personal attacks, misinformation, and relentless negativity, as voters are being asked to choose between two major party candidates who most distrust and view unfavorably—a “lesser of two evils” choice to many. This isn’t the first “lesser evils” election; in Fear and Loathing, Hunter wrote, “How many more of these stinking, double-downer sideshows will we have to go through before we can get ourselves straight enough to put together some kind of national election that will give me and the at least 20 million people I tend to agree with a chance to vote FOR something, instead of always being faced with that old familiar choice between the lesser of two evils?” (1)\nYet, like the choices or not, the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or businessman Donald S. Trump will result in starkly different outcomes for America’s health care system. It’s not just health care that is at stake; it’s the health of our democratic system of government itself.\nThe anger and distrust evidenced by large swaths of the electorate today, and the poisonous atmosphere that it has introduced into the election, didn’t just suddenly arise. It came about because of four trends—reactions to changing demographics; distrust of government; partisanship and gridlock; and now, populism—that have been gathering steam for decades, only to come to a head in this election.\nCHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS\n“The U.S. electorate this year will be the country’s most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Nearly one-in-three eligible voters on Election Day (31%) will be Hispanic, black, Asian o\nDoc 4(Title: Refugees and Asylees in the United States) \nhe displacement, it is likely that these numbers will increase (several thousand Venezuelans have been granted asylum, as discussed below).\n\n**Top Refugee-Receiving States**\n\nIn the first eight months of FY 2023, refugees’ top initial resettlement destinations were Texas (approximately 10 percent, or 3,100 individuals), New York (6 percent, or 2,000 refugees), California (6 percent, or 1,800 individuals), Kentucky (5 percent, or 1,600), and Pennsylvania (5 percent, or 1,500). Other notable states of resettlement in FY 2023 were Michigan (1,400), Ohio (1,400), North Carolina (1,300), Arizona (1,300), and Washington (1,300). Fifty-two percent of all refugees resettled during the period were in one of these ten states.\n\nThis trend is roughly consistent with prior years. Five states—Texas, California, New York, Michigan, and Ohio—received one-third of the 508,100 refugees resettled nationwide between FY 2012 and FY 2022 (see Figure 4).\n\n**Figure 4. Refugee Arrivals by Initial U.S. State of Residence, FY 2012-22**\n\n![Image 6](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_charts/spt-2023-refugees-fig4.png)\n\n_Note_: Data do not account for refugees’ movement between states after their initial resettlement.  \n_Source_: MPI analysis of State Department WRAPS data.\n\nStates also differ quite significantly by resettled refugees’ countries of origin. For example, refugees from DRC—the largest group admitted to the United States in the first eight months of FY 2023—comprised the top group in only 28 states. Six states resettled more Burmese refugees than any other nationality. Five states received more Syrian refugees than any other group. Refugees from Afghanistan made up the largest groups in California and Virginia. Ukrainians were the top group in Washington state, Venezuelans were top in Florida, and Somalians were the largest in Minnesota.\n\nArriving refugees are placed in communities based on factors including their needs, family ties, and the receiving community’s language and health-care services, housing availability, educational and job opportunities, and cost of living. In early 2023, the Biden administration launched Welcome Corps, an initiative that allows groups of U.S. citizens and permanent residents to privately sponsor refugees identified for protection by the resettlement program. Sponsors must submit a welcome plan, pass background checks, donate or raise $2,375 per refugee, and commit to supporting them for at least 90 days.\n\n**Religions of Refugees**\n\nOverall, the United States admitted more Christian refugees in the past decade than those of any other religion. Between FY 2012 and FY 2022, Christians represented 49 percent (246,900) of all 508,100 resettled refugees. Christians’ share was much higher for some nationalities, including some of the largest groups. For instance, in FY 2022, 94 percent of refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 78 percent from Eritrea, and 44 percent from Iran reported being Christian.\n\nDuring the last decade, 36 percent (184,000) of refugees admitted to the United States were Muslim. Virtually all refugees from Somalia and Syria were Muslim, as were 81 percent of refugees from Iraq and 44 percent from Myanmar.\n\nFY 2016 marked the only time since 2012 when the United States resettled more Muslim refugees (46 percent, or 38,900 individuals) than Christians (44 percent, or 37,500 individuals) (see Figure 5). The Trump administration’s restrictions on admission of nationals of some mostly Muslim countries, additional vetting procedures, and historically low admissions ceilings substantially affected the proportion of resettled Muslim and Christian refugees. Under the Biden administration, there has been an increase in the number of resettled Muslim refugees, closer to the levels of prior years.\n\nOver the last decade, the shares of refugees identifying as Buddhist, Hindu, or members of other religions fell, and the shares of t\nDoc 5(Title: accurate election outcome (the Biden 4.4-point margin among voters), and a 10-point Democratic Party affiliation nonvoter advantage to go with the larger (and inaccurate) 12-point Biden margin among voters.2 These adjustments, in effect, simulate different samples of the public. In addition to the weighting to generate the candidate preference and party affiliation scenarios, the surveys are weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, education and many other characteristics.3 This kind of weighting, which is common practice among polling organizations, helps ensure that the sample matches the population on characteristics that may be related to the opinions people hold.) The simulation takes advantage of the fact that our principal source of data on public opinion is the American Trends Panel, a set of more than 10,000 randomly selected U.S. adults who have agreed to take regular online surveys from us. We conducted surveys with these same individuals approximately twice per month in 2020, with questions ranging across politics, religion, news consumption, economic circumstances, technology use, lifestyles and many more topics. For this analysis, we chose a set of 48 survey questions representing a wide range of important topics on nine different surveys conducted during 2020.\nAfter the November election, we asked our panelists if they voted, and if so, for whom. We also collect a measure of party affiliation for all panelists, regardless of their voter status. With this information, we can manipulate the share of Biden vs. Trump voters in each poll, and Democrats vs. Republicans among nonvoters, and look back at their responses to surveys earlier in the year to gauge how our reading of public opinion on issues differs in the two versions.\nBefore describing the results in more detail, it’s important to be explicit about the assumptions underlying this exercise. We can manipulate the share of voters for each presidential candidate and the share of Democrats and Republicans among nonvoters, but the results may not tell the full story if the Trump and Biden voters in our surveys do not accurately represent their voters in the population. For example, if believers of the internet conspiracy theories known as QAnon are a much higher share of Trump voters in the population than in our panel, that could affect how well our simulation reflects the impact of changing the number of Trump voters. The same is true for our adjustments of the relative shares of Democrats and Republicans. If the partisans in our panel do not accurately reflect the partisans in the general public, we may not capture the full impact of over- or underrepresenting one party or the other.\nHow much can the balance of these two scenarios affect measures of opinion on issues?\nThe adjustment from the tilted version (a 12-point Biden advantage with a 10-point Democratic advantage in party affiliation among nonvoters) to the balanced version (a 4.4-point Biden advantage with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans among nonvoters), makes very little difference in the balance of opinion on issue questions. Across a set of 48 opinion questions and 198 answer categories, most answer categories changed less than 0.5%. The average change associated with the adjustment was less than 1 percentage point, and approximately twice that for the margin between alternative answers (e.g., favor minus oppose). The maximum change observed across the 48 questions was 3 points for a particular answer and 5 points for the margin between alternative answers.\nOne 3-point difference was on presidential job approval, a measure very strongly associated with the vote. In the balanced version, 39 percent approved of Trump’s job performance, while 58 percent disapproved. In the tilted version, 36 percent approved of Trump’s performance and 60 percent disapproved. Two other items also showed a 3-point difference on one of the response options.

However, directly relating this to US population stabilization via limiting family size requires broader socio-economic and demographic analysis. Let's focus on immediate direct effects:\n\n<search> impact of limiting family size to 2 children per couple on U.S. population stabilization </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: e the study’s model – such as war, economic depression, climate crisis, changing immigration patterns or religious innovations – could reverse current religious switching trends, leading to a revival of Christianity in the United States. But there are no current switching patterns in the U.S. that can be factored into the mathematical models to project such a result.) None of these hypothetical scenarios is certain to unfold exactly as modeled, but collectively they demonstrate how much impact switching could have on the overall population’s religious composition within a few decades. The four main scenarios, combined with four alternatives outlined in Chapter 2, show that rates of religious switching in adulthood appear to have a far greater impact on the overall religious composition of the United States than other factors that can drive changes in affiliation over time, such as fertility rates and intergenerational transmission (i.e., how many parents pass their religion to their children).\nThe decline of Christianity and the rise of the “nones” may have complex causes and far-reaching consequences for politics, family life and civil society. However, theories about the root causes of religious change and speculation about its societal impact are not the focus of this report. The main contribution of this study is to analyze recent trends and show how the U.S. religious landscape would shift if they continued.\nThis report focuses on Christians and the religiously unaffiliated, the two most common, very broad religious identities in the United States today. People with all other religious affiliations are combined into an umbrella category that includes Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and a diverse array of smaller groups that together make up about 6% of the U.S. population. In 2015, Pew Research Center projected the growth of several of these groups separately, both in the U.S. and around the world, and the Center may do so again in the future. But, because data on religious switching and intergenerational transmission is less reliable for groups with small sample sizes in surveys, non-Christian groups are not shown separately in this report.\nThe report also does not project change for subgroups of Christians, such as Protestants and Catholics, or for subgroups of “nones,” such as atheists, agnostics and people who describe their religion as “nothing in particular.” For the latest figures on the religious composition of the U.S., including some subgroups, see our 2021 report, “About Three-in-Ten U.S. Adults Are Now Religiously Unaffiliated.”\nScenario assumptions and projection results\nThe four main scenarios presented here vary primarily in their assumptions about the future of religious switching among Americans between the ages of 15 and 29 – which are the years when most religious change happens. Only a modest amount of switching is modeled among older adults.\nFertility and mortality rates are held steady, as are rates of intergenerational transmission. In each scenario, the groups begin with their current profiles in terms of age and gender. Christians, for example, are older than the religiously unaffiliated, on average, and include a higher share of women.\nFinally, the models assume that migration remains constant, which helps explain why non-Christian groups follow the same trajectory in each of the four scenarios. Immigration has an outsized effect on the composition of non-Christian groups in the U.S. because adherents of religions like Islam and Hinduism make up a larger share of new arrivals than they do of the existing U.S. population.\nChapter 2 presents four additional scenarios that explore the impact of the factors held constant here. These additional projections show how the U.S. religious landscape might change if current switching patterns held steady, but intergenerational religious transmission occurred in 100% of cases; there were no fertility differences by religion; there was no switching after age 3\nDoc 2(Title: This report seeks to answer the question: What might the religious makeup of the United States look like roughly 50 years from now, in 2070, if recent trends continue? We try to address this not with sweeping predictions or grand theories, but with mathematical projections that combine techniques standardly used in demography (the study of human populations) with data we have collected in surveys on religion.) Demographers project the growth or shrinkage of populations based on factors such as age, sex, fertility, mortality and migration. For religious populations, projections also need to include data on “switching” – voluntary movement into and out of religious groups. Finally, the shifting sizes of U.S. religious groups depend partly on rates of religious transmission – whether parents pass their religious identity on to their children. In this report, Pew Research Center has incorporated estimates of “intergenerational transmission of religion” into our projections for the first time.\nSwitching rates are estimated based on responses from more than 15,000 adults to two questions posed in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey: “In what religion, if any, were you raised?” and “What is your present religion, if any?” Results were weighted to the Center’s National Public Opinion Reference Survey, conducted by mail and online in 2020. Long-term cohort trends in switching (going back to the 1970s) come from two similar questions in the long-running General Social Survey: “In what religion were you raised?” and “What is your religious preference?”\nShifts in religious identity, or switching, are concentrated among young adults. During earlier childhood years, a parent’s religion (or lack thereof) is often, but not always, transmitted to a child. Rates of transmission for three identity categories (Christian, other religion, and religiously unaffiliated) are estimated based on the percentages of teens (ages 13 to 17) who shared their mother’s religious affiliation in a 2019 survey of 1,811 pairs of U.S. parents and teens. These observed patterns are used to model whether future generations of newborn children inherit their mother’s religion.\nGroup differences in fertility (the number of children women tend to have), migration and age structures also drive change. Fertility differences by religion are based on the National Survey of Family Growth, while the average U.S. fertility rate used in each period is based on the 2019 revision of United Nations World Populations Prospect data. Migration data comes from the UN. Religious composition by age and sex groups is based on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel. We estimate the religious composition of children based on the religious composition of young adults, and fertility patterns.\nThe various input data is used in projection models to illustrate what the future religious composition of the U.S. might look like under a range of hypothetical scenarios. See Methodology for more information on inputs and modeling.\nSince the 1990s, large numbers of Americans have left Christianity to join the growing ranks of U.S. adults who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular.” This accelerating trend is reshaping the U.S. religious landscape, leading many people to wonder what the future of religion in America might look like.\nWhat if Christians keep leaving religion at the same rate observed in recent years? What if the pace of religious switching continues to accelerate? What if switching were to stop, but other demographic trends – such as migration, births and deaths – were to continue at current rates? To help answer such questions, Pew Research Center has modeled several hypothetical scenarios describing how the U.S. religious landscape might change over the next half century.\nThe Center estimates that in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones,” acc\nDoc 3(Title: n that hypothetical situation, the religious makeup of the U.S. population would continue to shift gradually, primarily as a result of Christians being older than other groups, on average, and the unaffiliated being younger, with a larger share of their population of childbearing age.) Outcome: If switching had stopped altogether in 2020, the share of Christians would still decline by 10 percentage points over 50 years, reaching 54% in 2070. The unaffiliated would remain a substantial minority, at 34%.\nWhich scenario is most plausible?\nThe scenarios in this report present a wide range of assumptions and outcomes. Readers may wonder which scenario is most plausible. While there are endless possibilities that would lead to religious composition change that is different from the plotted trajectories, it may be helpful to consider how closely the hypothetical switching scenarios adhere to real, observed trends.\nThe “no switching” scenario (No. 4) is not realistic – switching has not ended and there is no reason to think it will come to an abrupt stop. The purpose of this scenario is to show the influence of demographic factors (such as age and fertility) on religious affiliation rates. Still, if fewer future young adults switch from Christianity to no affiliation, or if movement in the opposite direction increases, the future religious landscape might resemble the results of this projection.\nThe “steady switching” scenario (No. 1) is conservative. It depicts moderate, steady “net” switching (taking into consideration some partially offsetting movement in both directions) away from Christianity among young adults for the foreseeable future, rather than the extension of a decades-long trend of increasing disaffiliation across younger cohorts. Even long-standing trends can be unsustainable or otherwise temporary, and this scenario best represents what would happen if the recent period of rising attrition from Christianity is winding down or already has ended.\nBy contrast, the scenario of rising disaffiliation without limits (No. 3) assumes there is a kind of ever-increasing momentum behind religious switching. The visible rise of the unaffiliated might induce more and more young people to leave Christianity and further increase the “stickiness” of an unaffiliated upbringing, so that fewer and fewer people raised without a religion would take on a religious identity at a later point in their lives.\nIntergenerational transmission is the passing of religious identity from parents to children. It occurs (or fails to occur) in childhood. In this study, transmission rates are calculated based on the share of children who inherit their mother’s religion (or their mother’s unaffiliated identity) because mothers tend to successfully transmit their religious identities more often than fathers do. Also, roughly a quarter of children under 18 live in single-parent households, which are overwhelmingly headed by mothers.\nThe Center’s data shows the vast majority of teens (about 85%) have the same religious identity as their mother, while 16% report a different identity. Religious transmission, as measured in this study, can fail to occur for many reasons and in either direction. For example, if a mother doesn’t identify with any religion but her 14-year-old child identifies as Christian, it’s counted as a non-transmission of religious identity – just as it would for a Christian mother with a religiously unaffiliated teen.\nIntergenerational transmission differs from switching because it describes what happens before the age of 15 and is measured by comparing the religious affiliation of mothers with the affiliations reported by their teenage children. Switching, by contrast, describes a change that happens after the age of 15; it is measured by comparing the religions in which respondents say they were raised with the affiliations they report today.\nOn the other hand, highly religious parents tend to raise highly religious children who are less like\nDoc 4(Title: s held constant here. These additional projections show how the U.S. religious landscape might change if current switching patterns held steady, but intergenerational religious transmission occurred in 100% of cases; there were no fertility differences by religion; there was no switching after age 30; or there was no migration after 2020.) The alternative scenarios are intended to help isolate – and thereby illuminate – the impact of various factors. One might think of the projections as an experiment in which some key drivers of religious composition change are turned on or off, sped up or slowed down, to see how much difference they make. For more information about modeling assumptions and results, see Chapter 2 and the Methodology.\nScenario 1: Steady switching – Christians would lose their majority but would still be the largest U.S. religious group in 2070\nSwitching assumption: Switching into and out of Christianity, other religions and the religiously unaffiliated category (“nones”) continues among young Americans (ages 15 to 29) at the same rates as in recent years. Most significantly, each new generation sees 31% of people who were raised Christian become religiously unaffiliated by the time they reach 30, while 21% of those who grew up with no religion become Christian.\nOutcome: If switching among young Americans continued at recent rates, Christians would decline as a share of the population by a few percentage points per decade, dipping below 50% by 2060. In 2070, 46% of Americans would identify as Christian, making Christianity a plurality – the most common religious identity – but no longer a majority. In this scenario, the share of “nones” would not climb above 41% by 2070.\nScenario 2: Rising disaffiliation with limits – ‘nones’ would be the largest group in 2070 but not a majority\nSwitching assumption: Continuing a recent pattern, switching out of Christianity becomes more common among young Americans as each generation sees a progressively larger share of Christians leave religion by the age of 30. However, brakes are applied to keep Christian retention (the share of people raised as Christians who remain Christian) from falling below about 50%.3 At the same time, switching into Christianity becomes less and less common, also continuing recent trends.\nOutcome: If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up initially but then hold steady, Christians would lose their majority status by 2050, when they would be 47% of the U.S. population (versus 42% for the unaffiliated). In 2070, “nones” would constitute a plurality of 48%, and Christians would account for 39% of Americans.\nScenario 3: Rising disaffiliation without limits – ‘nones’ would form a slim majority in 2070\nSwitching assumption: The share of Christians who disaffiliate by the time they reach 30 continues to rise with each successive generation, and rates of disaffiliation are allowed to continue rising even after Christian retention drops below 50% (i.e., no limit is imposed). As in Scenario 2, switching into Christianity among young Americans becomes less and less common.\nOutcome: If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up throughout the projection period without any brakes, Christians would no longer be a majority by 2045. By 2055, the unaffiliated would make up the largest group (46%), ahead of Christians (43%). In 2070, 52% of Americans would be unaffiliated, while a little more than a third (35%) would be Christian.\nScenario 4: No switching – Christians would retain their majority through 2070\nSwitching assumption: This scenario imagines no person in America has changed or will change their religion after 2020. But even in that hypothetical situation, the religious makeup of the U.S. population would continue to shift gradually, primarily as a result of Christians being older than other groups, on average, and the unaffiliated being younger, with a larger share of their population of childbearing age.\nOutcome: If sw\nDoc 5(Title: S.Hrg. 107-1050 — HUMAN CLONING) \n children from coital reproduction and \nnothing more.

She also estimated a 75-100% (median average - 87.5%) probability of a AI-caused extinction in the next 5-50 years (median average-27.5 years).[51]\nFrom climate change\n[edit]In a 2010 interview with The Australian, the late Australian scientist Frank Fenner predicted the extinction of the human race within a century, primarily as the result of human overpopulation, environmental degradation and climate change.[52] There are several economists who have discussed the importance of global catastrophic risks. For example, Martin Weitzman argues that most of the expected economic damage from climate change may come from the small chance that warming greatly exceeds the mid-range expectations, resulting in catastrophic damage.[53] Richard Posner has argued that humanity is doing far too little, in general, about small, hard-to-estimate risks of large-scale catastrophes.[54]\nIndividual vs. species risks\n[edit]Although existential risks are less manageable by individuals than, for example, health risks, according to Ken Olum, Joshua Knobe, and Alexander Vilenkin, the possibility of human extinction does have practical implications. For instance, if the \"universal\" doomsday argument is accepted, it changes the most likely source of disasters, and hence the most efficient means of preventing them. They write: \"...you should be more concerned that a large number of asteroids have not yet been detected than about the particular orbit of each one. You should not worry especially about the chance that some specific nearby star will become a supernova, but more about the chance that supernovas are more deadly to nearby life than we believe.\"[55]\nDifficulty\n[edit]Some scholars argue that certain scenarios such a\nDoc 2(Title:  the region, quiet submarines that could approach U.S. Seventh Fleet ships undetected, and potent threats against American cyber, space, and communications systems that have previously provided the United States with unalloyed asymmetric advantages.3 Russia, for its part, is in a position to move up to several hundred thousand forces within its own borders quickly, such that they could threaten NATO members Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—at a time when those three Baltic nations combined have aggregate military strength of just some 30,000, and when the United States plus other NATO allies only have about 5,000 troops in the general vicinity under normal peacetime conditions.4) One might ask why the United States should shoulder so much of the burden of deterring Russia and China—shouldn’t our allies do more? While some of America’s allies have stepped up to the plate in terms of defense spending (for example South Korea at about 2.4 percent in 2018, Australia and the U.K. at 2 percent, and France at 2.3 percent of their GDP), many have not kept their military spending levels as high as they had promised, and they have not always spent their resources well. So, without a doubt, the United States must continue to press allies to spend more for their own defense. However, even if allied defense budgets rise, the reality is that there is no substitute for the skill and scale of the U.S. military. Thus, the United States must take a lead role in deterring China and Russia from coercion or aggression.\nFinally, one might ask, isn’t the Department of Defense—a federal agency not even able to audit its own expenses—so wasteful that it can preserve or improve combat power with far fewer budgetary resources? While it is true that DoD is inefficient, much of the waste is marbled into muscle—difficult to excise without painstaking and patient work, lest major combat capabilities be damaged along the way. For example, the military health care enterprise is probably too large and expensive. But access to high-quality health care is a crucial military benefit that helps attract and retain such a high-quality all-volunteer force. And most proposals for health care reform would, once implemented, save at most a few billion dollars a year—important savings, yet modest relative to the overall size of the nation’s military budget and defense needs.\nOr take base closures. After five generally successful rounds of base closures and realignments since the late 1980s, the DoD still has 20 percent more infrastructure than its current force posture requires. More base closures are needed—at least one if not two more rounds. A future round will likely yield eventual savings of $2 billion to $3 billion a year, like the first four rounds.5 That’s real money, but not huge money relative to a $700 billion-plus budget. Also, net savings would not accrue for half a decade. So, like many defense reforms, base closures are more a question of smart long-term planning than a near-term budgetary fix.\nThe Mattis agenda: “Sharpening the American military’s competitive edge” for great-power competition\nThere is much to like about the overall direction that former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis had taken, and Secretary Mark Esper has since sustained, at the Pentagon. Although we have often been critics of Trump administration foreign policy, there is a clarity and cogency to longer-term defense strategy, reflected most vividly in Mattis’ National Defense Strategy of early 2018, entitled “Sharpening the American Military’s Competitive Edge.” That document prioritized great-power competition over the forever wars of the Middle East and South Asia. The shift toward focusing on China’s rise, with economic and diplomatic as well as military tools, had begun in the Obama administration, with the so-called pivot or rebalance to Asia starting in 2011. The changes intensified after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and aggression against eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the promulgati\nDoc 3(Title: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Statement for the Record Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community) \npeace agreement signed between the government and opposition\n\ngroups in September 2017 faces delays and implementation difficulties.

[13] During sixteen long months this assault has blotted out the whole pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations, great and small. And the assailants are still on the march, threatening other nations, great and small.\n[14]Therefore, as your President, performing my constitutional duty to “give to the Congress information of the state of the Union,” I find it, unhappily, necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our borders.\n[15] Armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents. If that defense fails, all the population and all the resources of Europe, and Asia, and Africa and Australasia will be dominated by conquerors. And let us remember that the total of those populations in those four continents, the total of those populations and their resources greatly exceeds the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere–yes, many times over.\n[16] In times like these it is immature–and incidentally, untrue–for anybody to brag that an unprepared America, single-handed, and with one hand tied behind its back, can hold off the whole world.\n[17] No realistic American can expect from a dictator’s peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion–or even good business.\n[18] Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. “Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.”\n[19] As a nation, we may take pride in the fact that we are softhearted; but we cannot afford to be soft-headed.\n[20] We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal preach the “ism” of appeasement.\n[21] We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests.\n[22] I have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this war.\n[23] There is much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the seas. Obviously, as long as the British Navy retains its power, no such danger exists. Even if there were no British Navy, it is not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack us by landing troops in the United States from across thousands of miles of ocean, until it had acquired strategic bases from which to operate.\n[24] But we learn much from the lessons of the past years in Europe-particularly the lesson of Norway, whose essential seaports were captured by treachery and surprise built up over a series of years.\n[25] The first phase of the invasion of this Hemisphere would not be the landing of regular troops. The necessary strategic points would be occupied by secret agents and by their dupes- and great numbers of them are already here, and in Latin America.\n[26] As long as the aggressor nations maintain the offensive, they-not we–will choose the time and the place and the method of their attack.\n[27] And that is why the future of all the American Republics is today in serious danger.\n[28] That is why this Annual Message to the Congress is unique in our history.\n[29] That is why every member of the Executive Branch of the Government and every member of the Congress face great responsibility and great accountability.\n[30] The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily–almost exclusively–to meeting this foreign peril. For all our domestic problems are now a part of the great emergency.\n[31] Just as our national policy in internal affairs has been based upon a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all of our fellow men within our gates, so our national policy in foreign affairs \n</information>\n\n\n\n\nIt seems the information provided doesn't directly point to a specific country likely to start World War III. It mentions risks related to nuclear weapons, supervolcanic eruptions, artificial intelligence, climate change, and geopolitical tensions. Let me search more specifically.\n<search> country most likely to start world war III </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title:  the region, quiet submarines that could approach U.S. Seventh Fleet ships undetected, and potent threats against American cyber, space, and communications systems that have previously provided the United States with unalloyed asymmetric advantages.3 Russia, for its part, is in a position to move up to several hundred thousand forces within its own borders quickly, such that they could threaten NATO members Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—at a time when those three Baltic nations combined have aggregate military strength of just some 30,000, and when the United States plus other NATO allies only have about 5,000 troops in the general vicinity under normal peacetime conditions.4) One might ask why the United States should shoulder so much of the burden of deterring Russia and China—shouldn’t our allies do more? While some of America’s allies have stepped up to the plate in terms of defense spending (for example South Korea at about 2.4 percent in 2018, Australia and the U.K. at 2 percent, and France at 2.3 percent of their GDP), many have not kept their military spending levels as high as they had promised, and they have not always spent their resources well. So, without a doubt, the United States must continue to press allies to spend more for their own defense. However, even if allied defense budgets rise, the reality is that there is no substitute for the skill and scale of the U.S. military. Thus, the United States must take a lead role in deterring China and Russia from coercion or aggression.\nFinally, one might ask, isn’t the Department of Defense—a federal agency not even able to audit its own expenses—so wasteful that it can preserve or improve combat power with far fewer budgetary resources? While it is true that DoD is inefficient, much of the waste is marbled into muscle—difficult to excise without painstaking and patient work, lest major combat capabilities be damaged along the way. For example, the military health care enterprise is probably too large and expensive. But access to high-quality health care is a crucial military benefit that helps attract and retain such a high-quality all-volunteer force. And most proposals for health care reform would, once implemented, save at most a few billion dollars a year—important savings, yet modest relative to the overall size of the nation’s military budget and defense needs.\nOr take base closures. After five generally successful rounds of base closures and realignments since the late 1980s, the DoD still has 20 percent more infrastructure than its current force posture requires. More base closures are needed—at least one if not two more rounds. A future round will likely yield eventual savings of $2 billion to $3 billion a year, like the first four rounds.5 That’s real money, but not huge money relative to a $700 billion-plus budget. Also, net savings would not accrue for half a decade. So, like many defense reforms, base closures are more a question of smart long-term planning than a near-term budgetary fix.\nThe Mattis agenda: “Sharpening the American military’s competitive edge” for great-power competition\nThere is much to like about the overall direction that former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis had taken, and Secretary Mark Esper has since sustained, at the Pentagon. Although we have often been critics of Trump administration foreign policy, there is a clarity and cogency to longer-term defense strategy, reflected most vividly in Mattis’ National Defense Strategy of early 2018, entitled “Sharpening the American Military’s Competitive Edge.” That document prioritized great-power competition over the forever wars of the Middle East and South Asia. The shift toward focusing on China’s rise, with economic and diplomatic as well as military tools, had begun in the Obama administration, with the so-called pivot or rebalance to Asia starting in 2011. The changes intensified after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and aggression against eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the promulgati\nDoc 2(Title: ed <...>) - ^ Kramer, Andrew E.

Surveying shows that the EU has the highest support in 35 years.[57] The UK has also seen a resurgence of EU based support with polls showing that in September 2018 more British residents thought Brexit would be wrong, by 46% to 43%.[58][59][60][6] By November 2020, 47% of respondent to a YouGov/Eurotrack poll would vote to rejoin compared with 38% committed to leaving.[61] By February 2021 the YouGov/Eurotrack poll showed that the ratio had reversed: 39% of the UK electorate would wish to rejoin the EU as against 41% who would vote against that option.[61] The same poll showed pro-remain majorities in Germany (55%/22%), France (51%/26%), Denmark (62%/23%) and Sweden (56%/25%).[61]\nIn campaign of Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election, her party National Rally held a eurosceptic position but at the same time, Le Pen stopped promoting Frexit.[citation needed] In the 2018 Italian general election, the populist Five Star Movement and the right wing Lega Nord, both Eurosceptic, received 32% and 17% respectively.[citation needed]\nLanguages\n[edit]Danuta Hübner, the head of the European Parliament Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has argued that after Brexit, English would no longer be an official EU language: \"We have a regulation … where every EU country has the right to notify one official language. The Irish have notified Gaelic, and the Maltese have notified Maltese, so you have only the U.K. notifying English ... If we don’t have the U.K., we don't have English.\"[62]\nHowever, this statement has been contradicted by the European Commission Representation in Ireland, whose spokesperson argued that changing the current language regime would require a unanimous vote by the Council,[63] as well as by President Jean-Claude Juncker in an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 9 August 2017.[64] However, Juncker has also stated that despite this, in the wake of Brexit, English is losing its importance in Europe[65] and members of the German Bundestag have called on staff in EU institutions to use German more often.[66]\nWhen the United Kingdom and Ireland joined the EU's predecessor in 1973, French was the dominant language of the institutions. With the addition of Sweden and Finland in the 1990s, and the Eastern European states in the 2000s, English slowly supplanted French as the dominant working language of the institutions. In 2015, it was estimated that 80% of legislative proposals were drafted first in English. The role of English as a lingua franca is believed to be likely to continue, given how heavily staff rely on it,[67][62] and that in European schools, 97% of children learn English as an additional language, compared with 34% learning French and 23% learning German.[68]\nDr Marko Modiano has suggested, in an academic paper, that Euro English could be codified in a similar way to native English varieties following Brexit.[69][70]\nLanguage rules are currently covered, amongst others, by: Article 55 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) (which lists the 24 \"Treaty languages\" in which the Treaty is drawn up);[71] Articles 20 and 24 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which lay down the rights of citizens to petition the European Parliament and to address the institutions in any of the Treaty languages and to obtain a reply in the same language, and Article 342 TFEU, which states that \"the rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Union shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, be determined by the Council, acting unanimously by means of regulations\";[72] and Council Regulation No 1/1958,[73] which lists the current 24 official languages.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table\". ec.europa.eu.\n- ^ \"First population estimates.

REUTERS/Gleb Garanich\nBetter options\nPutin’s Russia is not the only possible Russia, any more than Brezhnev’s Soviet Union was an immutable culmination of Russian history. The Kremlin’s definitions of its interests are not the only option for Russia.\nA Russia less authoritarian at home, more constructive abroad, and less hostile to the West and its values, is by no means inevitable. But, in the authors’ view, it is possible. They do not believe that Russia is, as the influential foreign affairs writer Samuel Huntington would have it, civilizationally predetermined to live down to its worst traditions. They also do not believe that Gorbachev’s new thinking or Yeltsin’s far-reaching hopes for his country’s reform and integration with the West were fanciful or mere enthusiasm.\nIf Ukrainians and Belarusians are ready to risk their lives for the sake of democracy and justice at home, then it seems strange to argue that Russians are, and will always be, content to live under the knout. Recent protests in Khabarovsk are just the latest reminder that there are Russians who yearn for greater freedom and the right to choose their own leaders. As was the case with the Soviet Union during the late Brezhnev period and the reign of Nicholas I, defeat of aggressive designs abroad can trigger a turn to domestic reform. The first attempt to reform post-Soviet Russia failed. The next effort, if it comes, may do better.\nUS policy guidelines\nThe United States needs a policy framework to address both Russia’s dismal current realities and its better future potential. The authors offer the following suggestions.\nDon’t be in a hurry.\nThe United States and Putin’s Russia have fundamentally different values and clashing visions of the international order. No single summit, visit, reset, offer, or threat will turn things around.\nDon’t seek a “grand bargain” with Putin.\nHis terms would include the two demands on which previous attempts at better relations have foundered: a Kremlin free hand at home (e.g., no pressure about human rights, democracy, or free elections, and no complaints about repression or assassinations), and a Kremlin free hand in its sphere of privileged interests (i.e., subjugation of Ukraine, Belarus, and other states formerly part of the Soviet Union). No US administration has been able to, or should, accept such terms. It would not only be a betrayal of US values, but it also wouldn’t bring lasting stability. Sooner or later, the people of these countries will demand better, as has been seen in Ukraine, Georgia, and Belarus.\nDon’t sacrifice other countries on the altar of better relations with Moscow.\nEven when the United States tries to tacitly recognize Moscow’s control, as Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger did with respect to Warsaw Pact countries, the Kremlin’s rule was neither stable nor sustainable. On the contrary, better relations begin with an end to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, especially the eastern Donbas. Russian use of force against Belarus would (and should) be another problem in US-Russian relations, and the cause for additional sanctions or other punitive steps.\nDon’t buy into clichés about Russia,\ne.g., that it is civilizationall\nDoc 5(Title:  been since the close of World War II at the 38th parallel.)

Over 90 nations lost people in those two Towers.\nAnd then we realized that they were also attacking the Pentagon, had attacked the Pentagon, and that fourth plane that crashed in the field in Pennsylvania might have been heading to the White House or might have been heading to my own department, the State Department. It might have been heading right to this building that we're sitting in here today. You realize that there's a strike directly at the capital of a superpower, the capital of the leader of the world that wants to be free: Washington.\nSIR DAVID FROST: And there's been talk about the intelligence and other things. Condoleezza Rice said, \"I don't think there was any personal failure on my part, but I keep on thinking, 'How could I have done something different. Is there any way I could have known?'\" I mean, you must all have had that.\nSECRETARY POWELL: We all go through that. And I've been in many crisis situations in the course of my career as a soldier, as a National Security Advisor, and now as Secretary of State, and whenever something happens that is a surprise, a shock, some tragedy occurs, you immediately start thinking, \"Is there anything that we could have done differently? Was there any information that came to me earlier that should have suggested this was going to happen?\"\nIn this instance, I've played that tape over and over. We knew that something was going on. Our Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, throughout the summer was giving us warnings: There's something going on, something's happening, something's going to happen; we're not sure what it is. But we've never had enough insight or fidelity into reports we were getting to have predicted something of this magnitude or this nature. It was something we had never seen before. I mean, we look for bombs, we look for terrorists, but we never thought one of our airplanes would be the bomb or where it would be heading, or people had made such an elaborate plan to pull this off. We had no insight into the nature of that plan.\nSIR DAVID FROST: And so how has foreign policy changed as a result of 9/11? How has your approach -- swapping the once-Communist enemy for the terrorist enemy, and yet that's a vague and elusive force -- how has it changed the job you do?\nSECRETARY POWELL: It became a new kind of enemy. It wasn't a state. It was an organization that found safe harbor in many states -- here in the United States, Saudi Arabia, in Pakistan, in Asia. There are al-Qaida cells all over the world. And it was not a state; it knew no boundary, it knew no territory that you could go attack. Yes, you could go attack Pakistan and get rid of the Taliban and get rid of the headquarters, but that wasn't getting rid of all of al-Qaida.\nSIR DAVID FROST: Was it difficult putting this coalition together in the last year, to the Gulf War coalition?\nSECRETARY POWELL: A lot different. In the case of the Gulf War, there was a front -- the Iraqi army sitting in Kuwait -- and a different kind of coalition was needed and it was easy to get the UN mobilized. And what we had to do was put an army in that part of the world to get the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. This was a little different.

A combination of factors that coalesced in the late 1990s led the catastrophic event. These factors included regional conditions in the Middle East that motivated the perpetrators, as well as intelligence lapses and failures that left the United States vulnerable.\nOsama Bin Laden was relatively unknown in the United States before 9/11, even as he was amassing popularity, followers, and fame in the Middle East during the 1990s. In 1988, he was one of the founders of al Qaeda, a militant Islamic terrorist organization that organized and carried out the 9/11 attacks. Bin Laden called for indiscriminate killing of all Americans who, he claimed, were “the worst thieves in the world today” (9/11 Report, page 47). It was the perfect historical moment for that rallying cry.\nThroughout the 20th century, a wave of secular, nationalist revolutions swept through the Middle East, taking root in Egypt, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, and other countries. While these movements were awash in promising ideology, the new regimes quickly became autocratic and suppressed dissent. Their critics turned to violent revolution to express their dissatisfaction with the secular governments.\nAt the same time, social malaise, especially among young men who were struggling to find decent jobs and start their own families in corrupt oil states, provided easy targets for radicalization. Bin Laden’s message that America was the “head of the snake” and the root of all society’s problems resonated well with the discontent.\nBy the mid-1990s, Bin Laden was the head of al Qaeda, a multifaceted and highly developed terrorist network carrying out attack after attack on Americans in the Middle East. It was a new type of terrorism to which the US intelligence agencies struggled to adapt. Much of the intelligence community had not even imaged the specific type of hijacking and terrorism carried out on 9/11. They were preparing for threats such as th\nDoc 3(Title: ring of members of al-Qaeda, an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the United States, its citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001.) - Iraq's \"continuing to aid and harbor other international terrorist organizations\", including anti-United States terrorist organizations.\n- Iraq's alleged plans to launch attacks against United States using weapons of mass destruction.\n- Iraq's alleged plans to transfer weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organizations.\n- Iraq allegedly paying bounties to families of suicide bombers.\n- The efforts by the Congress and the President to fight terrorists, including the 11 September 2001 terrorists and those who aided or harbored them.\n- The authorization by the Constitution and the Congress for the President to fight anti-United States terrorism.\n- The concerns of governments in Turkey, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia regarding Saddam Hussein and their desire for his removal from power.\n- The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, a resolution which reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.\nThe Iraq War Resolution required President Bush's diplomatic efforts at the UN Security Council to \"obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions\". The resolution authorized the United States to use military force to \"defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq\".\nWeapons of mass destruction\n[edit]The US government's belief that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the form of nuclear weapons was based upon intelligence which the CIA argued could not be trusted.[36] The CIA was overruled on its opinion on nuclear weapons as the administration sought outside information from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress (INC). Declassified CIA reports from 2002 suggested Iraq had begun production of other forms of WMDs in the form of chemical warfare agents such as mustard gas, sarin, Cyclosarin, and VX.[37]\nGeorge Bush, speaking in October 2002, said that \"The stated policy of the United States is regime change … However, if [Saddam Hussein] were to meet all the conditions of the United Nations, the conditions that I have described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed.\"[38] Similarly, in September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in an answer to a parliamentary question, that \"Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction\".[39] In November of that year, Blair further stated that \"So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not regime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime; I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people … so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, but on the other hand I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction; it is not regime change.\"[40]\nBetween September 2002 and May 2003, Bush administration began attempting to mix its \"war on terror\" rhetoric with weapons of mass destruction allegations, in addition to espousing allegations of Iraqi support to al-Qaeda.[41] In his 2003 State of the Union address delivered on 28 January 2003, George W. Bush insinuated about hypothetical scenarios wherein Ba'athist Iraq was plotting to perpetrate mass-casualty attacks using chemical weapons:\n\"Before September the 11, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and sh\nDoc 4(Title: ost hours of my life, little moments every day, to watching planes go by. Despite all that was going on, 9:02 a.m. on September 11, 2001, was the last minute of my life that was free of the obligation of noticing.) The rhetoric around 9/11 is always that it was this massive singular event that will never be replicated. That we should #NeverForget it. That it’s special. It’s not. Little 9/11s happen constantly. We often create them out of situations that didn’t have to be disasters at all.\nUnsurprisingly, the people who suffer the most in disasters big and small are often the people with the least agency — kids. Every day in America, millions of children head to school worried that a random act of gun violence could end their lives. Kids in Flint, Michigan, prepare for school without clean water or living with the complicated legacies of having gone years without that resource. Kids in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Houston, Texas, get dressed in homes and neighborhoods still dealing with flood damage or flooding anew. Kids in California wake up in neighborhoods suffused with smoke from acres-wide fires and have to pretend it’s like any other day. Kids living in pandemic hot zones or, frankly, anywhere in America in 2020 and 2021, watch their world shrink overnight.\nThe experience of 9/11 may have been on a larger scale than a few of these, an act of mass violence paired with a major health and environmental disaster, but that doesn’t mean that these individual crises aren’t bad enough on their own. Lives are irrevocably changed by smaller disasters, too.\nOften the way we process the scale of a disaster isn’t really about how big it is, anyway. A lot of big and little 9/11s happen to kids and communities that don’t have the coattails of responders or other designated “heroes” to ride or financial resources to throw around or voices the media is willing to seek out. Even with the clarifying effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on many Americans, we at most do some hand-wringing. We ask, “What did we do to create this problem?” Then we do nothing.\nOccasionally, when adults fail to take proper stock of the situation, we leave kids to ask what’s going on themselves. March for Our Lives, the impressive organization that was formed by student survivors in the aftermath of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, is an outgrowth of a system in which adults shirked their duty to think critically about the role they had played in creating a crisis. It shouldn’t have been on the kids who were victimized to inquire about the policies that led to their trauma, but somebody had to.\nIn 2006, fresh out of college, I started an advocacy organization called StuyHealth that advocates for young adults impacted by the 9/11 disaster and the World Trade Center cleanup. Ever since I have been doing the work of raising the profile of that story and letting the students of 9/11 know about the services available to them. In 2019, I testified before Congress alongside comedian Jon Stewart and 9/11 first responder Det. Lou Alvarez, who has since died of cancer, to make sure students would be a part of the Zadroga Act’s permanent renewal.\nIf we learn anything from the slow-rolling, still simmering COVID-19 crisis, I hope it’s this: That preemptive action to save people from suffering is always a good idea. That it’s worth a risk to the economy to make sure people are safe. People are our most important asset, not financial indicators. In the aftermath of a crisis, however, I don’t think that we should be initially preoccupied with how we allowed the crisis to happen. When the damage is done, what we should ask first is, “How can we protect survivors from further harm?”\nPeople rarely mention the unpleasant reality that is living with the long-term consequences of a disaster, but we do see glimmers of it in the news sometimes in reports, for example, about GoFundMe accounts popping up for gunshot victims and cancer p\nDoc 5(Title: ss release).

Gimble, found that the Defense Department's Office of Special Plans – run by then-Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith, a close ally of Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld – purposely manipulated evidence to further strengthen the case for war.[5][122][123] These claims were supported by the July 2005 release of the so-called Downing Street memo, in which Richard Dearlove (then head of British foreign intelligence service MI6) wrote that \"the intelligence and facts were being fixed [by the US] around the policy\" of removing Saddam Hussein from power.[87]\nA study published in 2005 by American political scientists Amy Gershkoff and Shana Kushner Gadarian, which analyzed George Bush's speeches and polling data between September 2001 and May 2003, found that it was the American public's views about Saddam Hussein's perceived connections with al-Qaeda and the September 11 attacks that became the major catalyst behind the rise in support of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq among Americans.[124] According to the findings of the study:\n\"2003 war in Iraq received high levels of public support because the Bush administration successfully framed the conflict as an extension of the war on terror, which was a response to the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Our analysis of Bush's speeches reveals that the administration consistently connected Iraq with 9/11. New York Times coverage of the president's speeches featured almost no debate over the framing of the Iraq conflict as part of the war on terror. This assertion had tremendous influence on public attitudes, as indicated by polling data from several sources.\"[125]\nIntelligence experts argued that the Iraq War increased terrorism, even though no acts of terrorism occurred in the US. London's conservative International Institute for Strategic Studies concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become \"a potent global recruitment pretext\" for jihadists and that the invasion \"galvanized\" al-Qaeda and \"perversely inspired insurgent violence\" there.[citation needed] Counter-terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna called the invasion of Iraq a \"fatal mistake\" that greatly increased terrorism in the Middle East.[126] The US National Intelligence Council concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had encouraged a new generation of terrorists; David B. Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with \"a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills ... There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various other countries.\" The Council's Chairman Robert L. Hutchings said, \"At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity.\"[127] And the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate outlined the considered judgment of all 16 US intelligence agencies, held that \"The Iraq conflict has become the 'cause celebre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement.\"[128] Al-Qaeda leaders also publicly cited the Iraq War as a boon to their recruiting and operational efforts, providing both evidence to jihadists worldwide that America is at war with Islam, and the training ground for a new generation of jihadists to practice attacks on American forces. In October 2003, Osama bin Laden announced: \"Be glad of the good news: America is mired in the swamps of the Tigris and Euphrates. Bush is, through Iraq and its oil, easy prey.

The resolution authorized the United States to use military force to \"defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq\".\nWeapons of mass destruction\n[edit]The US government's belief that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the form of nuclear weapons was based upon intelligence which the CIA argued could not be trusted.[36] The CIA was overruled on its opinion on nuclear weapons as the administration sought outside information from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress (INC). Declassified CIA reports from 2002 suggested Iraq had begun production of other forms of WMDs in the form of chemical warfare agents such as mustard gas, sarin, Cyclosarin, and VX.[37]\nGeorge Bush, speaking in October 2002, said that \"The stated policy of the United States is regime change … However, if [Saddam Hussein] were to meet all the conditions of the United Nations, the conditions that I have described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed.\"[38] Similarly, in September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in an answer to a parliamentary question, that \"Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction\".[39] In November of that year, Blair further stated that \"So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not regime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime; I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people … so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, but on the other hand I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction; it is not regime change.\"[40]\nBetween September 2002 and May 2003, Bush administration began attempting to mix its \"war on terror\" rhetoric with weapons of mass destruction allegations, in addition to espousing allegations of Iraqi support to al-Qaeda.[41] In his 2003 State of the Union address delivered on 28 January 2003, George W.

    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it seems that there are significant challenges making electric cars practical for widespread adoption. These include high costs, limited charging infrastructure, especially in areas outside major cities, and the overall impracticality for families living in apartments without private garages. Additionally, the reliance on certain countries, particularly China, for key materials, and the potential for higher emissions due to current electricity generation methods add to the impracticality claims. Thus, electric cars are seen as impractical based on current conditions.\n\n<answer> impractical </answer>\n\nBased on the challenges highlighted, electric cars are considered impractical at present.",
    "reasoning_chain": "\n\n<think> I need to check if electric cars are considered impractical. </think>\n<search> Are electric cars impractical? </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: Poll: A majority of Americans think electric cars are impractical) A recent survey from Rassmussen has found that most Americans, 52 percent, think that electric vehicles (EVs) are impractical and don’t expect them to replace gasoline-powered cars any time soon. Only 25 percent of Americans said they felt that EVs were practical for most drivers.\nThe poll results are not surprising. EVs make up only a tiny fraction of auto sales every year, and a study in California found that 18 percent of EV drivers switched back to gasoline due to difficulties charging the cars.\nThese challenges are becoming more pronounced. Electricity shortages in California have resulted in the grid operator pleading with residents not to charge their cars from 4-9 p.m. when electricity demand increases, but power generation from solar panels declines with the setting sun.\nGiven the reluctance of consumers to embrace EVs, it doesn’t make much sense for Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to impose California’s EV mandates, which would require auto manufacturers to stock 14,000 new EVs in our state each year.\nRather than trying to artificially manufacture demand for a product that most people don’t want, the Walz administration should respect the rights of Minnesotans to choose the car or truck that best suits their needs without forcing them to pay extra money to help subsidize the cost of someone else’s Tesla.\nDoc 2(Title: Turning into Redwood’s west parking lot in my dad’s navy blue Toyota Camry, I crane my neck to gaze at the four electric car charging stations situated across from the main office. The charging stations, along with the various electric car models using them, serve as a reminder of an unrealistic aspiration my family has had for the past half year.) Last May, as my birthday crept up on me and my twin brother, my parents began contemplating car options that would accommodate transportation for the entire family. We quickly realized the financial burden two licenses with insurance would have on our budget (my brother and I are still car-less), but the conversation about different vehicle options led my family to look into electric cars.\nUnfortunately, without a garage at either of my parents’ apartments, and therefore no charging outlet available, buying an electric car would be an impractical investment. With the generally high cost of electric cars combined with the inability to charge the car overnight or while at home, my parents scrapped our vision of an environmentally friendly car in our parking space.\nMy family’s situation emulates the struggle of apartment-dwellers in addition to lower-income families in California, a state which boasts the highest usage of e-cars in the United States per 1,000 people, according to InsideEVs.com. In 2019 alone, electric car sales have skyrocketed 63.7 percent according to the Los Angeles Times. Despite California’s massive increase in electric car sales in recent years, electric vehicle options for low-income families have remained insufficient and must improve soon for the betterment of our environment.\nIn general, electric cars are more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts, which makes it a challenge for low-income families to purchase zero emission vehicles. According to Edmunds, an online car research company, the most affordable electric cars range from $31,000 to $40,000, whereas numerous hybrid options (such as the 2019 Toyota Prius) are listed lower than $25,000. Naturally, gas cars are often cheaper; the 2019 Chevrolet Cruze, for example, is listed at just under $18,000.\nAdditionally, many families’ ability to charge an electric car is hindered by living in apartments where the charging process is inconvenient. Charging an electric vehicle at home requires an outlet from which owners can charge their cars with a portable charger. The vast majority of apartment-dwellers do not park in individual garages, and are therefore without outlets.\nMoreover, California’s public charging stations are concentrated predominantly around the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Outside of these two hubs for electric transportation, electric car chargers are dismally sporadic, sometimes located close to one hundred miles before the next station.\nThe evident scarcity of electric charging stations outside of the Bay Area and L.A. is an unfortunate indication of California’s failure to ensure electric car usage in low-income areas. Despite promoting state-wide environmentally friendly initiatives in past years, California has only established sufficient amounts of electric charging stations in the wealthiest areas of the state.\nFor instance, if the California legislature wishes to meet it’s 2030 goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent, charging options need to be available for low-income families and charging stations must be more evenly distributed throughout the state.\nProponents of electric car use may argue that while the initial price of electric cars may be more expensive, the cost of their future maintenance is much lower than gas cars. A study conducted by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Institute in 2018 found that electric cars, on average, cost less than half as much to operate than gas-powered cars. This stems from the fact that gas cars require frequent refuelings in addition to oil changes. However, electri\nDoc 3(Title:  is taking the saying “out of sight, out of mind” too literally.) Worse, America is dependent on countries such as China when it comes to EVs, and those countries will receive a windfall under Mr. Biden’s centrally planned industrial policy.\n>>> The Case Against Electric Vehicles\nChina will soon control about one-third of the world’s lithium supply, a critical component for EVs. Meanwhile, these essential resources, when mined overseas, are regularly done so by slave and child labor, and the International Energy Agency has admitted that the environmental damage from mining overseas could offset the reduced emissions from operating EVs domestically.\nEven more ironic, Mr. Biden again pitched EVs as “affordable” and renewed his commitment to providing EV charging stations in low-income communities. The average EV costs $61,000, which is 24% more than the average conventional internal combustion engine vehicle—hardly “affordable.”\nCharging stations are useless for Americans who can’t afford EVs. That’s like giving batteries to a child who has no toys in which to use them. The average American family has effectively lost $7,100 in purchasing power under Mr. Biden; people don’t need to pay more for a vehicle that can’t drive as far.\nThe incoherence of Mr. Biden’s energy policy knows no bounds. Hopefully, these policies will meet a speedy end the same way their equally fantastical predecessor, Don Quixote, did.\nThis piece originally appeared in The Washington Times\nDoc 4(Title: President Biden’s latest push for electric vehicles, or EVs, is reminiscent of a soliloquy by Don Quixote: short on facts, long on rhetoric, and filled with unrealistic expectations. Sadly, though, Mr. Biden’s policy mistakes are moving beyond fiction to a reality that confines consumers to cars that are unaffordable and unwanted.) Like Don Quixote tilting at harmless windmills he thinks are giants, Mr. Biden is attacking American energy and the auto industry for daring to use fossil fuels. And as Don Quixote went from quest to quest attempting to free imaginary prisoners, Mr. Biden is hellbent on freeing Americans from the imaginary captivity of their reliable, safe, flexible and economical gasoline- and diesel-fueled engines.\nThat disconnect from reality perfectly encapsulates Mr. Biden’s energy policy. His Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed such strict regulations for cars and trucks that effectively mean that 54% of new vehicles sold domestically must be EVs by 2030.\nEven if Mr. Biden managed a 500% increase in EV sales by the end of the decade, he’d still fall woefully short of his goal. The only conceivable way to make half of new vehicle sales EVs by 2030 would be if Americans were so poor that they could afford very few new cars, and thus the small number of EVs could still amount to half of all new vehicles. That’s right out of Mao’s Great Leap Forward.\n>>> Emissions-free Electric Vehicles Are a Fantasy\nJust from the standpoint of raw materials, Mr. Biden’s EV goal is fictitious. We simply cannot get the needed materials in sufficient volume in time. Furthermore, the schizophrenic energy policy of this administration is simultaneously ramping up demand for those raw materials while hamstringing the supply. Mr. Biden continues blocking mining of lithium, graphite, nickel and rare earth metals.\nThat’s inexplicable, since Mr. Biden’s green energy transition would increase demand for those materials by 4,200%, 2,500%, 1,900% and 700%, respectively, in less than 20 years.\nBut when you consider that “it has taken on average over 16 years to move mining projects from discovery to first production,” then Biden’s proposals aren’t unachievable—they’re laughable.\nAnd from where does Mr. Biden think the electricity to power these EVs will come? The strained electrical grid already has brownouts and blackouts in parts of the country and couldn’t handle millions more EVs, especially when Mr. Biden is also blocking copper mining, the main ingredient in electrical wires.\nThe grid’s transmission capacity would need to grow 60% in less than seven years and grow 200% in less than 30 years. And this is just the grid infrastructure, not what would be needed to power it.\nThe Biden administration repeatedly refers to EVs as zero-emission vehicles, as if the electricity powering them did not have emissions. EVs are powered primarily by fossil fuels, not just because fossil fuels generate much of our electricity but because they are dispatchable, meaning their electrical output can be ramped up and down in response to demand.\nConversely, wind and solar generate electricity only when conditions are right, regardless of demand, and nuclear power needs to stay at a very steady output to be efficient. That leaves coal and natural gas (and oil on rare occasions) to be the real workhorses of electrical generation. When everyone needs to cool their homes and offices at the same time, or charge their EVs, coal and natural gas throttle up.\nMr. Biden’s plan merely shifts emissions from one location to another. Instead of carbon dioxide leaving a tailpipe, it will leave a smokestack. Either climate change isn’t a global problem, or the president is taking the saying “out of sight, out of mind” too literally.\nWorse, America is dependent on countries such as China when it comes to EVs, and those countries will receive a windfall under Mr. Biden’s centrally planned industrial policy.\n>>> The Case Against Electric Vehicles\nChina will soon cont\nDoc 5(Title: Stopping Biden’s Radical Forced EV Transition) Americans Should Choose the Car They Drive\nPresident Biden and Democrats are leading a radical rush-to-green agenda that takes away people’s vehicle choice and forces Americans to drive electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are unaffordable and unrealistic for many Americans and a reliance on EVs cedes U.S. leadership to the Chinese Communist Party.\nAmericans don’t want President Biden’s aggressive EV mandates—they want to choose what vehicle best suits their needs.\nThat’s exactly what nearly 5,000 American car dealers told President Biden—twice—after EVs stacked up on their lots. They’re demanding the Biden administration “hit the brakes” on its unrealistic agenda.\nElectric vehicles continue to be more expensive than other alternatives and aren’t practical for many Americans—especially those living in rural communities. Furthermore, despite allocating $7.5 billion in 2021 to speed up its forced EV transition, the Biden administration just got its first vehicle charger up and running in Ohio one month ago. Hertz, a major rental car company, recently announced its plan to sell 20,000 electric vehicles and buy gas-powered cars instead.\nAdditionally, according to a recent study by Consumer Reports, EVs have almost 80 percent more issues and are generally less reliable than vehicles with internal combustion engines. Earlier this month, electric vehicles across the country were failing to charge—or keep a charged battery—as a result of cold weather. Electric vehicles lose an average of 41 percent of their range when temperatures drop to 20 degrees Fahrenheit. As reported by Fox Business, in Chicago, “charging stations essentially turned into car graveyards as temperatures have dropped.”\nThis forced EV transition also plays right into China’s hands. China controls the vast majority of critical minerals mining, processing, and manufacturing for electric vehicles. China has 78 percent of the world’s cell manufacturing capacity for EV batteries. To further their grip on EV technology against America, China implemented export controls on graphite, the single largest mineral component of any EV battery, on December 1, 2023. There is currently only one graphite-producing mine in North America.\nPolicy experts across the board are sounding the alarm on the national security consequences of Biden’s forced EV transition and how it will strengthen China’s foothold in the American auto industry for decades to come. More than a dozen former senior military officials recently warned President Biden that his rush-to-green agenda “will undoubtedly open the U.S. up to economic manipulations by China, identical to what Russia is doing with Ukrainian grain exports, and [poses] a major threat to our national security.”\nSenior administration officials, like U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, are also raising concerns about Chinese influence over the electric vehicle market, recently stating in a letter to President Biden that “China has developed and implemented a plan to target the EV sector for dominance.”\nEnergy and Commerce Republicans are leading to stop the administration’s radical EV agenda, preserve people’s vehicle choice, and ensure America—not China—is leading:\n- H.R. 1435, the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, led by Rep. John Joyce (R-PA), protects America’s automotive future by stopping California and President Biden from dictating the vehicles Americans can drive.

She argues convincingly in fact that while it serves a schooling purpose, the link between education and schooling is tenuous at best. She implies that government intrusion with its attendant regulations and certifications creates a dependency cycle that leaves it unclear as to who really needs whom. Do children need school or does the school bureaucracy need children in order to justify its existence? The continuously changing goal structure of public schooling suggests she may be on to something. Having come up somewhat short in their academic mission the schools have more recently taken on such responsibilities as self-esteem training, safe sex education, anger management as well as refusal skills and a host of other social programs. The agenda widens, encroaching upon territory previously thought to be within the spheres of home and church influence. She raises the trust issue in this context, more accurately the lack thereof, citing Horace Mann's characterization of parents as \"ignorant and vicious,\" hardly the qualities one seeks in the upbringing of the young. A benign bureaucratic influence, of course, is the answer Mann and his spiritual descendants would apply. A common complaint leveled at critics like Mary Novello is that they identify the illness without suggesting a cure. What on earth would young people do if they did not go to school? I would only say to her critics that the first step in solving a problem is to identify clearly what the problem is. And this is exactly what she has done.\nArthur K. Ellis, Professor\nSchool of Education\nSeattle Pacific University\nA Case against Compulsion\nCompulsory education is the chink in the armor of capitalist societies: they try to teach children the values of contract and initiative, but base their educational system on compulsion and conformity. Communist societies suffer from no such inconsistency: they try to teach their children command and obedience, and their educational system is consistent with inculcating this ethic.\n-Thomas Szasz (p.19)\nThere is a new kind of bounty hunter in the state of Oregon. This one tracks down the vicious criminals known as truants. In the town of Brownsville, she can earn $300.00 for each child who is returned to classes and a $500.00 bonus for turning in a youngster who eventually graduates from high school.\nIn the words of Patricia Lines (1985), \"Compulsory education laws typically are criminal laws, setting minimum requirements to protect children from parental neglect or from their own thoughtlessness\" (p. 4). Her study, sponsored by the National Institute of Education, revealed that state laws required parents of children aged from as young as 4 to as old as 18 to educate their children or send them to school, or face a fine and a jail sentence. She found that Mississippi had the longest jail term at one year and, along with Vermont, the highest cash fine at $1000.00.\nWhile admitting the unreliability of the statistics on truancy, she estimated that full-time truants account for around 9% of the school-aged population. That figure exceeds the population of children in unapproved education settings by a factor of at least 100, and \"yet, enforcement efforts appear to be directed at families who place their children in unapproved education settings\" (p. 26).\nThe impact of compulsory education laws and their enforcement is most profound on religious schools and home schoolers, although it should be noted that all the data indicate that children who attend private schools, religious schools, or are home schooled perform better on nationally standardized tests than their public school counterparts.

A shortened version of the text of the video appeared in the Deseret News and was authored by Senator Aaron Osmond and Oak Norton. The full text is below.\nWhy End Compulsory Education?\nThe Framers of the Constitution declared that America was the great experiment in self-government. We were to be given the freedom to govern ourselves as long as we didn’t violate someone else’s rights. Abraham Lincoln expressed this when he declared that our union was a government “of the people, by the people, and for the people.”\nIn other words, our republic derives its power from we the people. We give government permission to do certain things that we ourselves have a right to do, but would be less efficient in doing so as individuals. If we don’t have a right to do something, we can’t delegate it to government.\nFor example, we have a natural right to self-defense. Since we have that right, we can delegate authority to a Sheriff to keep the peace, and we can have a national military to protect us from foreign invasion.\nWe have no individual right to go into our neighbor’s home and take his property for what ever use without his permission. By the same token, we cannot delegate to the government the power to confiscate our neighbor’s property and redistribute it.\nIn like manner, if my neighbor’s children belong to him, then we cannot delegate to the government the power to enforce compulsory education or truancy laws on him or his children.\nBoth the U.S. supreme court and the State of Utah recognize that parents have a “fundamental liberty interest” for the education of their children. That being the case, we cannot provide government a legal power that trumps that parental right by way of compulsory education and truancy laws.\nUnder state laws, we mandate what a child must know, when they must know it, where they must go to learn it, how they should learn it, who must teach them, how long they should be taught, and why our children must have these things taught to them to the exclusion of other things parents deem important.\nPrior to compulsory education, parents and teachers worked together, there was less bureaucracy, less red tape, little data tracking beyond achievement, much less testing, and more opportunity for an education tailored to the child’s needs.\nIt’s well documented what happens when children are engaged in things that interest them and when they learn at their own pace. The Homeschool Legal Defense Association has documented research that indicates that children who pursue things that interest them and are allowed to learn at their own pace outscore children in general in the public school system by about 60%.\nThe difference lies in parents having the freedom to tailor the educational experience to the child’s needs and teachers being free to do what they know is best to meet the needs of both the parents and children.\nWhat are we teaching our children through compulsory education?\nPsychiatrist Thomas Szasz observed that:\n“Compulsory education is the chink in the armor of capitalist societies: they try to teach children the values of contract and initiative, but base their educational system on compulsion and conformity. Communist societies suffer from no such inconsistency: they try to teach their children command and obedience, and their educational system is consistent with inculcating this ethic.”\nWe send a mixed message to our children when we say we live in a free land, and then force them into a ridged, centra\nDoc 4(Title: f nuisances. Now, ignorance is as noxious as the most offensive nuisance, and more destructive than bodily contagions.) It is un-American and unadapted to our free institutions. To put the question in the most offensive form, it may be asked, \"Would you have policemen drag your children to school?\" I answer, \"Yes, if it will prevent his dragging them to jail a few years hence.\"\nCompulsory education is monarchical in its origin and history. Common as is this impression it is erroneous....Before the peace of Westphalia, before Prussia existed as a kingdom, and while Frederick William was only \"elector of Brandenburg,\" Connecticut adopted coercive education.\nAttendance would be just as large without the law as it is now. It may be so. But so far from being an objection, this fact is strong proof of the efficiency of that law which has itself helped create so healthful a public sentiment. Were the law to be abrogated to-morrow the individual and general interest in public education would remain. The same might have been said of Connecticut for more than 170 years after the adoption of compulsory education. During all that period a native of this State of mature age unable to read the English language would have been looked upon as a prodigy. Still, in Connecticut as well as in Germany, it was the law itself which greatly aided in awakening public interest and in fixing the habits, associations, and traditions of the people.\nPerhaps the syntax of 1872 was so different from that of today that it has rendered the last two of Northrop's refutations beyond interpretation, but they would seem to argue against the points he was trying to make, especially his use of the word \"coercive\". In those two paragraphs, however, he clearly gave credit to Germany (and Prussia before it became just a region) as the model for government schools in the United States.\nWhatever their ambiguities, however, those ringing words of Northrop have formed the basis of the defense of compulsory education for some 125 years.\nWhy Compulsory Education was Deemed Necessary\nNot many writers have been as honest as Troen (1976) who, in his study of the history of the St. Louis schools, pointed out that while by 1940 about half the children remained in school through age seventeen, \"This change did not come about only through the attractiveness of the new programs and the system's efforts at persuasion; compulsion was also necessary\" (p. 200).\nTwo of the reasons commonly cited for the establishment of compulsory education were illiteracy and child labor. These concepts are so frequently intertwined that it is nearly impossible to separate them. As Good (1956) said:\nUniversal literacy was until yesterday largely theory. Child labor was favored by parents, condoned by the public, and welcomed by business and agriculture. Many children did not get to attend the schools for the short terms during which they were open. They did not have the opportunity to learn the simple literacy which to many of the founding fathers seemed sufficient. If this seems a harsh indictment, it is truth which makes it so. (p.374)\nHe went on to say that in the census of 1840 \"More than 50,000 white illiterates were found in each of several states....[and] over the country, newspapers commented upon the admission by 500,000 white Americans that they were unable to read and write\" (p.383). However, even after some 75 years of compulsory education, \"Of the 18,000,000 men who were called up in World War II, 5,000,000 were rejected for physical, mental, and educational reasons, one-seventh, or 700,000 for 'mental deficiency,' which was largely educational deficiency\" (Good, 1956, p. 385).\nThe census question about literacy was changed in 1940 to ask the respondent how many years of schooling he had completed. It was assumed that five years of schooling would produce a literate person.\nResearch done by Randall in New York in 1871, three years before compulsory education legislation was passed in that st\nDoc 5(Title:  established in most countries of the Western world....What was at stake was not literacy and school attendance as such: high rates of literacy, almost universal school enrolment (sic) and intermittent school attendance were quite common before the introduction of mass compulsory schooling....Rather, what was significant was an international acceptance of the rational, compulsory-schooling model, a commitment of substantial proportions of public funds to the schooling enterprise and...irreversible breakthroughs in the actual enforcement of what came to be understood as the one model of efficient schooling.) (p. 123)\nAs teachers assumed more total power in loco parentis over educational space (circumscribed as it was by central authority), the authority of parents was eroded. The price of schooling was the surrender of parents' prerogatives during school hours. (p.142)\nHer conclusion, reflecting her feminist post-modernism, was that:\n...compulsory schooling, by forcing children out of the labour market, undercut many household economies, and provided a strong incentive for women to limit their fertility....Most existing research suggests that compulsion in itself made little difference to school attendance rates. Rather, the crucial point was when social conditions changed sufficiently for the laws to become plausible. In the end it was only with a fundamental readjustment of household economies, wage rates and fertility rates, that almost universal school attendance became feasible...effective introduction of compulsory schooling seems to be linked with a particular family form, one built around the male breadwinner model. This family form, in turn, was the result of a particular historical compromise regarding the articulation of gender, class and age relations, a compromise favouring men over women and the patriarchal interests of capitalists against the interests of many of them as employers. (p. 143)\nOf the theories and reasons suggested by these various writers for the rise of compulsory education, the most logical would seem to be that it became necessary to fill the government schools once they had been established. A secondary contributing factor would be the idleness created by child labor laws that prohibited young people from competing with union members for jobs. Or, as David Osterfield (1992) said it, \"In a pre-industrial society children support their parents; in an industrial society, parents support their children\" (p. 117).\nCourt Tests\nIn view of the fact that compulsory attendance legislation almost always faced stiff opposition from \"the unwillingness of the people to accept the principle that the state should be given the right to interfere with the traditional authority of parents\" (Good, 1956, p. 378), it is little wonder that the matter was taken up in the courts. Perhaps the first case to test the constitutionality of this legislation took place in Ohio. The court decided in 1891 that the compulsory education law of 1877 was constitutional, virtually the same decision that has been made every time the question has been raised.\nHowever, the Ohio decision declared that the welfare of the minor child was so important that the state had the right to interfere with the freedom of the parents. More typical has been the decision that compulsory schooling benefits the community and the state.\nLosing the right to oversee the religious development of their children was bitterly resented by many parents and the establishment of parochial schools was tolerated until the Oregon Education Act of 1922 declared, as mentioned earlier, that all children were to attend public schools. A Roman Catholic teaching order brought suit to have the law declared unconstitutional.\nThose who favored the law hearkened back to the arguments used in building the common school ideal of the early nineteenth century. They claimed that the demands of citizenship required the state to see to it that all potential citizens be given appropriat\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems arguments both for and against compulsory education exist. Some argue that compulsory education imposes a rigid system that goes against liberty and individual agency, while others argue it serves to protect children from neglect and promotes basic literacy and skills. However, the historical necessity often stems from addressing issues like illiteracy and child labor. Considering the modern context, the idea leans towards preserving the core benefit of educating children widely while respecting individual freedoms, thus compulsory education likely remains beneficial. \n\n<answer> no </answer>\n\nThis nuanced argument weighs benefits against drawbacks but generally supports maintaining compulsory education due to societal benefits despite individual liberty concerns.",

    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it seems Obama never ran for presidency again after his first term. Further, public sentiment leans towards seeing the presidency as a stabilizing force rather than a platform for partisan gain. Considering Trump's incumbency and the electorate's preference for stability and continuity, it is plausible that if Obama had run against Trump hypothetically, his previous success and the perceived stability of his presidency might have offered him an edge. However, direct comparison without polling data is speculative.\n\n<answer> yes </answer>\n\nGiven the typical voter preference for stability and Obama's prior success, it's reasonable to hypothesize he might have beaten Trump, although concrete evidence would require polling or election simulation data.",

What our modern-day two-term presidents can tell us\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were all reelected for vastly different reasons. What matters is that they all won second terms. It's also worth pointing out, as we look to 2020, that they all beat opponents who were not particularly strong candidates.\nOur modern two-term trio also suggests another reality of presidential politics: Even as our politics at the congressional level and in the media reflect severe polarization, volatility and partisanship, it may well be that Americans look to the presidency as a kind of port in the storm, a stable refuge from the uncertainty and chaos of our otherwise dysfunctional politics.\nDespite taking a battering over the years, especially during the 1960s and 1970s, the office of presidency still represents what's left of our affinity and allegiance to national symbols and values embodied in an office and in an individual -- the only elected official whom we can all vote for. Whether it's Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, Bush with his megaphone at Ground Zero or Obama in the wake of the Charleston shootings, we look to our presidents to lead, console, inspire and guide us through trauma and crisis.\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were nowhere near achieving undeniable greatness in the presidency. Indeed, they were all flawed and imperfect leaders. Still, when considering a second term, Americans seemed willing to forgive their flaws, favor their strengths over their liabilities and make allowances for their transgressions.\nWhether it's risk-aversion, inertia or any number of rationalizations among voters for not making a change midstream, the last quarter-century has demonstrated a remarkable stability in the presidency.\nSo what does this stability -- unseen for over two centuries -- say about the prospects for a fourth consecutive two-termer? The whole idea of making predictions a year-plus before an election is perilous -- even during ordinary times. And we are not living in anything remotely resembling ordinary times.\nThe power of Trump's incumbency is uncharted territory\nAs an incumbent, Trump carries unprecedented advantages. A strong economy and a nation secure from foreign threats extricating itself from foreign wars adds to that advantage. But what of the idea of the presidency as a source of stability, continuity and unity -- a place of leadership in tune with the best of America's norms and values?\nWhatever their failings -- and there were many, particularly Clinton's behavior with a presidential intern -- Donald Trump's three predecessors saw the office of the presidency as something greater than themselves, a national trust of sorts. They too encountered much of the partisanship and climate of conspiracy that helped fuel Trump's rise. But they never exploited it as a strategy and governing principle; and never departed -- certainly never as egregiously and selfishly as Trump has -- from their role as unifiers and custodians of the values of the office.\nIf the presidency remains a source of comfort and stability, a place of unity and a high ground for Americans despite all that divides them, Trump has brought precisely the opposite to the office: disruption, disrespect and the delegitimization of longstanding values and norms that have defined the presidency's resilience over the years.\nWill Trump become the first fourth-consecutive two-term president in American history? The answer may well depend on whether enough Americans still value the office of the presidency -- and whether they demand from its occupant a respect for the standards and integrity that generations of Americans have come to expect from their presidents.\nDoc 2(Title: Almost eight years after Barack Obama’s election as the nation’s first black president –an event that engendered a sense of optimism among many Americans about the future of race relations1 – a series of flashpoints around the U.S. has exposed deep racial divides and reignited a national conversation about race. A new Pew Research Center survey finds profound differences between black and white adults in their views on racial discrimination, barriers to black progress and the prospects for change. Blacks, far more than whites, say black people are treated unfairly across different realms of life, from dealing with the police to applying for a loan or mortgage. And, for many blacks, racial equality remains an elusive goal.) These findings are based on a national survey by Pew Research Center conducted Feb. 29-May 8, 2016, among 3,769 adults (including 1,799 whites, 1,004 blacks and 654 Hispanics).2 The survey – and the analysis of the survey findings – is centered primarily around the divide between blacks and whites and on the treatment of black people in the U.S. today. In recent years, this centuries-old divide has garnered renewed attention following the deaths of unarmed black Americans during encounters with the police, as well as a racially motivated shooting that killed nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\nThe survey finds that black and white adults have widely different perceptions about what life is like for blacks in the U.S. For example, by large margins, blacks are more likely than whites to say black people are treated less fairly in the workplace (a difference of 42 percentage points), when applying for a loan or mortgage (41 points), in dealing with the police (34 points), in the courts (32 points), in stores or restaurants (28 points), and when voting in elections (23 points). By a margin of at least 20 percentage points, blacks are also more likely than whites to say racial discrimination (70% vs. 36%), lower quality schools (75% vs. 53%) and lack of jobs (66% vs. 45%) are major reasons that blacks may have a harder time getting ahead than whites.\nBlacks and whites also differ in their opinions about the best approach for improving race relations: Among whites, more than twice as many say that in order to improve race relations, it’s more important to focus on what different racial and ethnic groups have in common (57%) as say the focus should be on what makes each group unique (26%). Among blacks, similar shares say the focus should be on commonalities (45%) as say it should be on differences (44%).\nWhen asked specifically about the impact President Barack Obama has had on race relations in the U.S., a majority of Americans give the president credit for at least trying to make things better, but a quarter say he has made race relations worse. Blacks and whites differ significantly in their assessments. Some 51% of blacks say Obama has made progress toward improving race relations, and an additional 34% say he has tried but failed to make progress. Relatively few blacks (5%) say Obama has made race relations worse, while 9% say he hasn’t addressed the issue at all.\nWhen asked about their views of Black Lives Matter, the activist movement that first came to national prominence following the 2014 shooting death of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, roughly two-thirds (65%) of blacks express support, including 41% who strongly support it. Among whites, four-in-ten say they support the Black Lives Movement at least somewhat, and this is particularly the case among white Democrats and those younger than 30.\nAnd while about eight-in-ten (78%) white Democrats say the country needs to continue making changes to achieve racial equality between whites and blacks, just 36% of white Republicans agree; 54% of white Republicans believe the country has already made the changes necessary for blacks to have equal rights with whites.\nHow blacks an\nDoc 3(Title:  Obama about those who would say, “They’re gonna come for our guns.” Obama said that wasn’t happening in the United States, though he was vague about what kinds of sweeping changes he might ultimately support. And he said any major changes would have to come through Congress.) Obama: Well, in fact, typically right after Newtown happened, for example, gun sales shot up. And ammunition shot up. And each time that these events occur, ironically, gun manufacturers make out like bandits, partly because of this fear that’s churned up that the federal government and the black helicopters are all coming to get your guns. And part of my argument is that it is important for folks to understand how hunting and sportsmanship around firearms is really important to a lot of people. And it’s part of how they grew up. Part of the bonding they had with their dad. It evokes all kinds of memories and traditions. And I think you have to be respectful of that.\nThe question is just, is there a way of accommodating that legitimate set of traditions with some common sense stuff that prevents a 21-year-old who is angry about something or confused about something, or is racist or is deranged, from going into a gun store and suddenly is packing, and can do enormous harm. And that is not something that we have ever fully come to terms with. Unfortunately, the grip of the NRA on Congress is extremely strong. I don’t foresee any legislative action being taken in this Congress. And I don’t foresee any real action being taken until the American public feels a sufficient sense of urgency and they say to themselves, “This is not normal. This is something that we can change, and we’re going to change it.” And if you don’t have that kind of public and voter pressure, then it’s not going to change from the inside.\nMore recently, in the wake of the shootings at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, Obama referenced the gun control policies of Australia and Great Britain.\nObama, Oct. 1: We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours — Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.\nA Library of Congress report notes that Great Britain has “some of the most stringent gun control laws in the world.” Handguns are prohibited without special permission, which requires the owner to demonstrate a good reason for possession — and self-defense is not considered a good reason.\nBut Obama did not advocate similar policies in the U.S.\nObama, Oct. 1: This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. … So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations doesn’t make sense.\nNor did Obama suggest he was considering sweeping unilateral action, instead deferring to Congress to make any big changes.\nObama: Each time [a mass shooting] happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we’re going to have to change our laws. And this is not something I can do by myself. I’ve got to have a Congress and I’ve got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this.\nThat is consistent with Obama’s most aggressive push on gun control following the shootings in Newtown, in which a gunman shot and killed 20 students and six staff members. On Jan. 16, 2013, Obama announced that he would take 23 “executive actions,” including initiatives such as launching “a national safe and responsible gun ownership campaign” and issuing a presidential memorandum “requiring federal law enforcement to trace guns recovered in criminal investigations.”\nBut even as he announced those actions, Obama acknowledged the limit\nDoc 4(Title: n the delegate race\".

INTRODUCTION\n“Martial arts’”(MA) is a collective term that encompasses the multitude of combat sports, self‐defense, and hand‐to‐hand combat systems developed and implemented around the world. 1 Studies of MA participation have identified a wide range of benefits to school‐aged children. Physiological improvements include increased oxytocin levels, 2 increased flexibility, muscular fitness, and balance. 3 , 4 Additionally, emerging evidence indicates that MA may facilitate positive change in psychological, 5 cognitive, 6 and academic outcomes. 7 Internationally, education systems recognize the benefits of MA, with countries such as the USA having school wrestling teams and associated scholarships, while Budo (an umbrella term for traditionalist Japanese MA) is a mandatory element of junior high‐school physical education in Japan (Chambers and colleagues).\nDespite evidence of the positive benefits, some researchers warn against increased aggression levels and antisocial behavior among participants (when fighting techniques are the sole focus, rather than a holistic approach. 8 , 9 Furthermore, fighting skills and violence are often glorified and propagated in movies, television shows and other popular culture, 10 creating some unrealistic and/or untrue perceptions of MA as a collective. Thus, the incorporation of MA into school settings remains a challenge, partially due to school administrators' and teachers' safety concerns, and their perceptions of MA, and/or a lack of teacher training to deliver MA in an effective manner which meets curriculum objectives. 11\nWithin Australia, the New South Wales (NSW), Australian Capital Territory (ACT), South Australia (SA), Victoria (VIC) Department(s) of Education each currently provide specific safety guidelines and procedures for the teaching of MA within school contexts (NSW Government). 12 The guidelines suggest that MA is acceptable for implementation in both Primary and Secondary schools (assuming the safety guidelines are followed), but it is unclear whether teachers in these states are aware of these guidelines, and data confirming if and when MA is used in schools does not exist.\nFurthermore, numerous outcomes in both the current Australian Health and Physical Education curriculum, and NSW Personal Development, Health and Physical Education curriculum lend themselves to MA. 13 , 14 For example, traditional MA often incorporate ethical and social education, through methods such as meditation and philosophy, discussion, and consistent etiquette expectations (bowing to each other, showing respect to higher level students and instructors, and respecting equipment) in addition to physical training. 8 A number of outcomes from the afore mentioned syllabi, associated with physical activity, align with the foundations on which MA builds on, such as “adapting movement skills in a variety of contexts.” 13 For example, in grappling and wrestling, one mu\nDoc 4(Title:  both groups. Meditation/mindfulness, movement/parkour type activities (e.g., rolling, jumping, vaulting, falling safely), and learning how to dodge and block attacks were also found in the top five in both groups, but varied slightly in rankings. Both groups ranked learning how to use various traditional weapons (e.g., swords, bo staff, kali sticks) the lowest (Teachers = 2.88; Preservice teachers = 3.10).) 3.4.2. Comparison of means—Sex\nBeliefs\nTable 3 shows a statistically significant difference between male and female participants' beliefs relating to inclusion of MA training in primary school settings. While both males and females had a positive skew toward martial arts (scores≥3.58 out of 5), males rated this question higher (F = 3.59, M = 4.00; p = 0.017). There was a generally high mean score in favor of providing students in both primary (female = 4.04; male = 4.17) and high‐school (female = 4.16; male = 4.33) settings with the opportunity to try MA training. The lowest total mean was found in Q17.6: I believe the NSW Department of Education promotes martial arts as an acceptable in‐school sport, (female = 3.07; male = 2.77). Although both groups scored above 2.5, skewing in the direction of positive belief towards this question, there was a level of uncertainty around whether the NSW Department of Education promotes MA as an acceptable in‐school sport in both groups. Both participant groups indicated that they would strongly to very strongly (scores ≥4.13 out of 5) support the introduction of self‐defense or MA (of any kind) into the curriculum, however, participants were less confident in their ability to teach it themselves (female = 3.05; male = 3.32).\nPerceived benefits of martial arts training\nA statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) was seen in question 18.3: Martial arts training can improve muscular fitness in children and adolescents. Male participants responded more strongly to this question, but both groups responded strongly to this question (scores ≥4.14 out of 5). Although generally statistically nonsignificant, the “male” means for 9 out of 10 of these questions were higher than “female.” All means were skewed in a way that indicates participants believe MA training can provide children and adolescents with physiological and psychological, and social benefits.\nAttitudes toward teaching martial arts\nNo statistically significant differences were seen in this section, however, intergroup difference in Q20.2: I believe children and adolescents in general would enjoy participating in martial arts training approached statistical significance (p = 0.051), with the “male” group again scoring slightly more positively toward this belief. Although still in favor (scores≥3.65 out of 5), all respondents were less positive toward teaching MA to students themselves.\nFuture plans\nThere were no statistically significant differences between groups. A trend was found, with Q22.1, Q22.2, and Q22.3 all rating the highest among “female” and “male” groups. All six questions returned means skewed in favor of MA (mean≥3.21).\nMost beneficial martial arts topics for children and adolescents\nNo statistically significant differences were found in this section. Each gender shared a number of commonalities among the five highest mean scored topics. Q23.6: Teamwork/team building activities among classmates; Q23.7: Wellbeing/ethical discussions at the end of each session, focussing on topics such as respect, integrity, self‐control and so forth; Q23.2: Learning how to dodge and block attacks; Q23.10: Meditation/mindfulness; Q23.1: Movement/Parkour type activities (e.g., rolling, jumping, vaulting, falling safely); and Q23.5: Grappling/wrestling (e.g., how to safely escape if tackled or grabbed) were all shown to be included in the topics with the highest mean scores among each group. Q23.6: Teamwork/team building activities among classmates; and Q23.7: Wellbeing/ethical discussions at the end of each session, focussing on top\nDoc 5(Title: nd preservice teachers from Australia. Many participants did not realize that “NSW Government School Sport” had a protocol for teaching MA. The results indicate that teachers and preservice teachers view MA as a worthwhile activity, with a range of benefits including physiological and psychological, and support the inclusion of MA in school settings. These findings may provide support to advocate for more teacher training and professional development to enable the safe delivery of MA, and/or high quality PDHPE (and school sport) programs that draw from MA to deliver key outcomes in PDHPE. Furthermore, respondents indicated their support for MA content in school programs that incorporate teamwork, wellbeing/ethical discussions, learning how to dodge and block attacks, meditation/mindfulness, movement/parkour activates, as well as grappling/wrestling. This allows for the creators of future intervention, PDHPE, or sport programs to provide programs that incorporate the input provided by current and preservice teachers. This may in turn assist with school engagement with sports medicine‐based interventions, as such interventions are now able to reflect content that the teachers have shown to value and view as beneficial to students. Although a larger study is recommended to strengthen these conclusions, this study provides Australian school authorities with a baseline to further support teachers in their efforts to incorporate MA in school settings, through the provision of preservice teacher training, professional development for current teachers, or resources and program development.)

Most participants 66% (n = 64) have never participated in any form of MA training, and would not feel comfortable teaching this (Mean = 3.15; N = 89; SD = 1.284).\nTable 2.\nAbbreviations: N, number of responses; SD, standard deviation.\nMany participants, however, indicated they would enjoy teaching the subject matter to their students (Mean = 3.76, N = 86; SD = 1.073), and would be interested in learning how to incorporate martial arts into a classroom setting (Mean = 4.04; N = 85; SD = 0.096), and would be interested in attending professional development/accreditation to learn how to teach basic martial arts techniques to [their] students (Mean = 3.92; N = 85; SD = 1.003).\n3.4.1. Comparison of means—Teachers and preservice teachers\nBeliefs\nAs shown in Table 3, there were only two questions with statistically significant differences between groups. The first being Q17.6: I believe the NSW Department of Education promotes martial arts as an acceptable in‐school sport (p = 0.000). This was the lowest mean score for both groups. Preservice teacher participants rated higher on this question (Teachers = 2.33; Preservice teachers = 3.21), indicating they were more likely to have a higher perception of Government recognition of MA in NSW schools.

Qualitative feedback\nConcerns for the inclusion of martial arts in (my) school\nThere were two trends in the areas of concern given by respondents. The most common concern related to a perceived risk of injury. Several respondents voiced their concerns of Legal issues i.e., kids getting hurt, and how [they] would control it to ensure no one gets hurt. The other common concerns were related to the promot[ion] of violence in the school setting, and the incorrect use in the playground, practicing unsupervised.\nSuggestions for increasing the implementation of martial arts in schools\nAgain, two distinct trends emerged in these suggestions. The first being professional learning and resources. Respondents suggested to give teachers and preservice teachers training and to provide Easy to use resources including a website with videos to follow step by step. The second trend was a suggestion for MA to have a focus… on self‐defense rather than fighting, as well as a promotion of a … teamwork component &… mental wellbeing aspect & how it can positively impact participants.\n4. DISCUSSION\nThis questionnaire provided new insight into a selection of Australian teachers' (practicing and undergraduate) views and beliefs relating to MA and the implementation of such training in school settings. While the data indicates high levels of support for MA in school settings, some respondents showed their concerns for the safety of students, and the potential of students getting hurt. Interestingly, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Australian sports injury data (collected) 2012–2013 ranked MA (labeled combative sports and included Aikido, Chi Kung, Judo, Jujitsu, Karate, Kendo, Kick‐boxing, Ninjitsu, Taekwon‐Do, Tai Chi, and Martial arts [other]) as the 10th most commonly associated with hospitalized sport‐related facial fractures, shoulder dislocations, and injury to the cervical spine. 21 Sports such as Rugby union, Australian Rules football, Rugby league, Soccer, and Cycling respectively were associated with greater injury rates on these areas than MA. 21 Of note, in other injury categories, such as sport‐related cruciate ligament injury or head injuries combative sports did not rank in the top 10. 21 Additionally, in a study based on major trauma cases and deaths in the state of Victoria, Australia over a 10‐year period, the highest three frequencies were in cycling, motor sports and equestrian activities, 22 with neither Combative Sports nor MA of any kind ranking at all. It is also important to note that these results are from competitive and/or leisure and community based sport. School‐based activities are usually at a foundational and noncompetitive development levels, and thus present a lower risk of injury.\nAs stated by a multitude of researchers, 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 one of the main barriers preventing people from taking up MA as a hobby, or welcoming MA into the school environment, is the misconception of traditional MA. Traditional MA training often becomes misinterpreted and associated with the fighting skills and violence that are glorified and propagated in movies, television shows and other popular culture. 10 The “martial artist” stereotype depicted in these films finds themselves in several situations, in which he or she has to defeat an opponent (or a whole room full of opponents) using acrobatics, choreographed kick combinations, and weapons. The kicking and screaming of Bruce Lee is often mentioned as an example of the MA stereotype. This seemingly works in two ways. The first being\nDoc 5(Title: Many parents have become completely disillusioned with the standard method of schooling, whether public or private. They’ve become disappointed in the huge cost and the harm done by unmotivated and underpaid teachers. There have always been alternatives to the standard education path, such as home schooling, or, since the 1960’s, alternative schooling options such as Montessori schools. As a home-schooled kid myself, and now as an undergrad studying teaching, you could say that I have lot of my personality invested in this battle! In this article, I examine the pros and cons of these alternatives to mainstream schooling.) Home Schooling\nAny schooling is a school of hard knocks. And being thrown into the jungle is the best way to understand how things work. Being home schooled, and now as an adult, I have come to realize that you cannot expect someone or something to do your job for you. You have to do it yourself. If you have a problem, you have to find a solution. You have to be motivated to learn and to explore. And you have to be willing to take risks.\nI have always been interested in how things work, and during my home-schooling, I was encouraged to explore to find the answer for myself. And I found that I could take things apart and put them back together again. It wasn’t until the age of 15 that I met a mechanic, one of my dad’s friends. He showed me how to take apart and rebuild a motor one afternoon, while they sipped suds and talked. I went home and taught myself to do it again, on the lawnmower engine. When I was 17, I had the opportunity to do the same with a car’s transmission. I taught myself how to change the fluid etc. This was my first real experience with learning a technical skill. And it was the beginning of a lifelong quest. It’s not very feminine but hey, it’s awful handy when you’re in a remote little town!\nAfter that, I went to university to study teaching, and I have come to realize that education is a skill in itself. And it is not the kind of skill that you can learn in a classroom. It is something that you have to learn in the real world and through practice. And as a home schooled kid, I learned this skill very early. It is the reason why I am so passionate about teaching today.\nEveryone has this concerned notion about the myth that home-schooled kids turn out weird. Well, if you look at the statistics, it’s just not true. But you also have to look at it from another angle. If you have a kid who does not want to learn, no matter what kind of schooling you give them, it’s not going to work. And no one would want to home school a kid who is a real pain in the butt. At least mainstream schooling has a system in place to deal with and socialize the problem kids. And the home schooled kids do not have such issues. So it really depends on the kid. If you have a weird kid, maybe they’re not going to fit into mainstream schooling. On the other hand, being thrown into the big jungle of school is probably going to socialize them and they will very rapidly learn to not be such a weirdo. So it swings both ways. Most of all, you want to do what is right for your own kid, and make sure there’s a balance of learning at a rate that is fast enough for the individual person, while at the same time not just becoming an academic at age 10, and, you know, learning to talk to other humans too.\nAlternative Schooling\nI think that alternative schooling is a good option for people who don’t want to home school their kids. I think that alternative schools are also a great idea for children who cannot cope with mainstream schooling. The Montessori Schools are a good example of this. As a home-schooled kid, I occasionally went to a Montessori school through my primary school years, and it was a good alternative. The school had a lot of freedom for the kids. They were able to explore and learn at their own rate. I had already learnt to read, write and do simple math at an early age, on account of my home schooling, and if I had j\n</information>\n\n\n</think>\n\nWhile there are clear benefits like improving fitness and mental health, there are also drawbacks like concerns over safety and the risk of promoting violence.

Some groups promote exclusive reliance on prayer and ritual for healing nearly all diseases. Jehovah’s Witnesses oppose blood transfusions. Hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren have religious or conscientious exemptions from immunizations. Such exemptions have led to personal medical risk, decreases in herd immunity, and outbreaks of preventable disease. Though First Amendment protections for religious freedom do not include a right to neglect a child, many states have enacted laws allowing religious objectors to withhold preventive, screening, and, in some states, therapeutic medical care from children. Religious exemptions from child health and safety laws should be repealed so that children have equal rights to medical care.\nKeywords: Faith-based medical neglect, Public policy, Religious beliefs\nReligion and science are arguably two of the most powerful drivers in human existence. Many consider them different types of truth and both valid while others try to combine them or reject one for the other. Faith-based rejection of medical care has cost the lives of many children and poses challenges to providers.\nAsser and Swan (1998) reviewed deaths of 172 U.S. children after medical care was withheld on religious grounds from 1975 to 1995. Many of the children died of readily treatable infectious diseases and diabetes. The authors found that 80% of the children would have had at least a 90% likelihood of survival with timely medical care.\nMany types of child abuse and maltreatment have been justified by some on religious grounds—for example, severe corporal punishment, exorcism, forced labor, forced marriage, dangerous diets, conversion therapy, and sexual abuse. Yet only faith-based medical neglect is protected in statute. Preventive and screening measures from which many state laws provide religious exemptions include immunizations, metabolic testing, blood lead-level tests, newborn hearing tests, prophylactic eye drops, vitamin K injections or drops, vision examinations, dental examinations, and school instruction about disease (Children’s Healthcare Is a Legal Duty, hereafter cited in text as CHILD (2020a), Religious exemptions from health care). Oregon and Pennsylvania have religious exemptions from bicycle helmets for children (Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes §75–3510(b)(3); Oregon Revised Statutes 814.487).\nThis article discusses public policy and case law on faith-based medical neglect, beliefs against medical care in several denominations, and advice for providers who encounter religious objectors.\nScope of Statutory Exemptions\nReligious exemptions about medical care of sick and injured children vary widely in meaning. Some are likely innocuous while others allow preventable deaths. Several states have a religious exemption in their reporting laws or in statutory definitions of child abuse and neglect (e.g. Calif. Penal Code §11,165.2(b) and Rev. Code of Washington 26.44.020(18)). Such placement sends a message to the would-be reporter that withholding medical care on religious grounds is not child neglect and therefore should not be reported to state child protection services.\nThirty states have religious defenses in their criminal codes. Nine have religious defenses to negligent homicide, manslaughter, or capital murder. West Virginia’s statute defining the crime of murder of a child does “not apply to any parent.. . who fails or refuses.. . to supply a child.. . with necessary medical care” on religious grounds” (WV Code 61.8D-2(d)). Arkansas has a religious defense to capital murder for those who cause deaths of children “under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life” (Ark. Code 5–10-101(a)(9)(B)). There could be identical facts on what two Arkansas parents did to a child and one parent could be sentenced to death while the other would not be charged with murder – based upon their di\nDoc 3(Title: 's right of conscience by declining to participate in or pay for a particular health care service.)

Parents said they would support whatever decision the child made and promised to return for medical treatment if the child got sick again. These aspects contributed to the feeling of the bioethics team that the parents were “reasonable,” and they recommended that the hospital not seek a court order for treatment. The child later relapsed and died.) Both in court and in “negotiating” with parents, those seeking medical care for a child should not raise points that in essence discriminate among religions. For example, if a church says it does not absolutely prohibit medical care and allows members to make their own decision on it, some authorities have argued that the members do not then have the right to raise a religious objection. This is unfair and will lower the public’s and the church members’ respect for the state’s position. The focus should remain on the child’s needs. The state’s authority to protect the child from harm supersedes his parents’ right to practice religion when those rights come into conflict.\nRecommendations\nProviders may be able to obtain parents’ voluntary consent for treatment by understanding their beliefs, patiently communicating with families, and allowing diversity that does not prevent effective treatment. If they cannot obtain consent and medical care is necessary to prevent substantial harm, they should seek a court order for care.\nSuch actions are possible only when a child comes to providers’ attention. States should not have laws allowing religious objectors to refuse even to bring a sick child to medical attention. Religious exemptions from child health and safety laws should be repealed. The state has no evidence that prayer and ritual heal disease and no authority to oversee their use. It should therefore require all parents to provide medical attention to a child when reasonable parents would recognize a risk of substantial harm. Neglect laws should be modified to include failure to immunize when it poses a risk to an individual child that is much higher than average.\nConclusion\nUsing religion as a justification for medical neglect does not support the interests of children but has been allowed under many existing state laws and practices. This has resulted in harm and death. Repeal of such laws would improve the public health and the health of individual children.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nConflict of Interest\nThe author states that there is no conflict of interest.\nFootnotes\nPublisher’s Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nReferences\n- 1001 Questions and answers on the Christian life.

Nowhere in The Bible does it say that God can do the logically impossible. That is not the definition of Omnipotence.) There are other things God cannot do. Not just logically impossible things. He can’t commit sin. He cannot do evil acts because God is sinless and holy (Psalm 23:6, Psalm 25:8; Psalm 34;8; 2 Corinthians 5:21, etc.) and so to do those things would be to contradict His own morally perfect nature. Titus 1:2 says that it’s impossible for God to lie. It’s not that God merely chooses not to lie, but that He’s literally incapable of it. Why? Because lying is a sin and sin goes against God’s morally perfect nature. God can no more do evil then fire can cause things to freeze.\nRichard Bushey of “ThereforeGodExists.com also wrote about this question. And he said in the article “This is not to say that logic is some sort of force that transcends God that he is a slave to. But rather it is to say that logical consistency is founded in the person of God himself.” Indeed. Logical Consistency is a character trait of God like holiness, love, justice, etc. Indeed. God is a rational Being. Even if God’s power did allow him to do the logically impossible, at the very least, His nature would prevent Him from doing so.\nCan God do anything? Yes.

In contrast, an accidentally omnipotent being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.[6]) In addition, some philosophers have considered the assumption that a being is either omnipotent or non-omnipotent to be a false dilemma, as it neglects the possibility of varying degrees of omnipotence.[7] Some modern approaches to the problem have involved semantic debates over whether language—and therefore philosophy—can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.[8]\nProposed answers\n[edit]Omnipotence does not mean breaking the laws of logic\n[edit]A common response from philosophers is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything at all but, instead, that he can do anything that is logically possible; he cannot, for instance, make a square circle. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself, because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions by his nature. The Christian Bible, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, says it is \"impossible for God to lie\".[9][10]\nA good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George I. Mavrodes.[11] Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is not a limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a \"task\" is termed by him a \"pseudo-task\" as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsensical. Harry Frankfurt—following from René Descartes—has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone.\nFor why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task—the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift—whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposedly capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory—that of creating the problematic stone in the first place—why should He not be supposedly capable of performing another—that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?[12]\nIf a being is accidentally omnipotent, it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power.[6] On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the Christian doctrine of incarnation.[13]\nIf a being is essentially omnipotent, it can also resolve the paradox. The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent; therefore, it is impossible to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible—just like the accidentally omnipotent—and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.\nThe omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself, thus removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2, as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, non-omnipotent beings can compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:\nFor He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that s\nDoc 3(Title: something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:) For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.[14]\nThus, Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.\nIn a 1955 article in the philosophy journal Mind, J. L. Mackie tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have).[15] An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be all-powerful in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie about the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.[16]\n- God and logic\nAlthough the most common translation of the noun \"Logos\" is \"Word\" other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902–1985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as \"Logic\": \"In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God\". He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.\nGod obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the law of non contradiction by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.\nThis raises the question, similar to the Euthyphro Dilemma, of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to the theologians Norman Geisler and William Lane Craig, this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God's nature, like his omniscience or omnibenevolence.\nParadox is meaningless: the question is sophistry\n[edit]Another common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase \"could not lift\" does not make sense, and the paradox is meaningless.[17][18] This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence—contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it—is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, which it is not. An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)—or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings),[citation needed] that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he could not lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that could lift the stone could not.\nThe lifting a rock paradox (Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?) uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from them:\n- Lifting covers the definition of translation, which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, \"Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?\" For the rock to be unable to move from one space to another, it would have to be larger than sp\nDoc 4(Title: Omnipotence paradox) The omnipotence paradox is a family of paradoxes that arise with some understandings of the term omnipotent. The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even a logically contradictory one such as creating a square circle. Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for countering theism. Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether omnipotence is directed toward God himself or outward toward his external surroundings.\nThe omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 10th century, when Saadia Gaon responded to the question of whether God's omnipotence extended to logical absurdities.[1] It was later addressed by Averroes[2] and Thomas Aquinas.[3] Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to \"deny himself\".\nThe best-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the paradox of the stone: \"Could God create a stone so heavy that even he could not lift it?\" This is a paradoxical question because if God could create something he could not lift, then he would not be omnipotent. Similarly, if God was able to lift the stone then that would mean he was unable to create something he could not lift, leading to the same result. Alternative statements of the paradox include \"If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?\" and \"Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?\".\nOverview\n[edit]A common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: \"Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?\" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being can create a stone that it cannot lift, then it is not omnipotent because there is a weight threshold beyond its own power to lift. If the being cannot create a stone it cannot lift, then there is something it cannot create, and is therefore not omnipotent. In either case, the being is not omnipotent.[4] This modern version is referred to as the Paradox of the Stone.\nA related issue is whether the concept of \"logically possible\" is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.\nThe dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox—the irresistible force paradox: \"What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?\" One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Another response to this that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. However this does not hold up under scrutiny, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.[5]\nTypes of omnipotence\n[edit]Augustine of Hippo in his City of God writes \"God is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills\" and thus proposes the definition that \"Y is omnipotent\" means \"If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X\".\nThe notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An essentially omnipotent being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an accidentally omnipotent being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.[6]\nIn addition, some philos\nDoc 5(Title: are circle?\" The logical contradiction here is God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement \"God can lift this rock\" must have a truth value of either true or false; it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone too heavy to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this does not quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.) In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' do is not a limit on its actual agency, but an epistemological boundary without which omnipotence could not be identified (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. This process is merely a fancier form of the classic Liar Paradox: If I say, \"I am a liar\", then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an epistemological paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and thus the perceived paradox) is meaningless. Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning by adding the words \"God can\" before it.[17] Lewis additionally said that, \"Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved\". This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.[citation needed]\nParadox assumes the rock has already been created In 1999, Matthew Whittle asserts that it should not be outside the scope of powers for an omnipotent being to make itself non-omnipotent, so indeed making a rock too heavy to lift is possible for God. The follow-up question, \"Then can he lift it?\" assumes that the rock has already been created, so the correct answer would be \"Assuming he makes the rock, no\". And if asked, \"Is God thus not all powerful?\", the correct answer would be, \"God is indeed all powerful until such time as the rock is created\". The \"Paradox\" then is not really a paradox.\nLanguage and omnipotence\n[edit]The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, he stays generally within the realm of logical positivism until claim 6.4—but at 6.41 and following, he argues that ethics and several other issues are \"transcendental\" subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions t\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, the key points are:\n\n1. Omnipotence typically means having the ability to do anything that is logically possible.\n2. Creating a stone so heavy that even God cannot lift it introduces a logical contradiction, as it violates the law of non-contradiction (something cannot simultaneously be heavy enough to prevent lifting and not).\n3. Philosophers argue that God’s nature prevents him from performing actions that would make him not God (e.g., creating a being greater than himself).\n\nGiven these points, the action described creates a self-contradictory scenario that defies logical consistency, thus falling outside the bounds of what an omnipotent being can achieve.\n\n<answer> No </answer>\n\nGod cannot create a rock so heavy that he cannot lift it, as it would introduce a logical contradiction, violating the laws of logic and his own nature as an omnipotent being.",

According to a recent study in the esteemed science journal PLOS, people systematically understate their disbelief in human-caused climate change when answering surveys, so skepticism is more prevalent than many of us realize.) Given the urgency of the climate crisis, it’s crucial that we all do our part to educate any doubters we might encounter. That’s why the Rainforest Alliance has compiled six arguments commonly made by climate change deniers, along with science-backed responses you can deploy to convince them of the truth: that climate change is real, accelerating, and that we need to take bold action ASAP.\n1. Climate change denier claim: “This is the coldest winter we’ve had in years! So much for global warming.”\nThere’s a difference between climate and weather: Weather fluctuates day in, day out, whereas climate refers to long term trends—and the overall trend is clearly and indisputably a warming one. While the impacts of climate change have only just begun to hit the Global North, farmers in the tropics have been contending with impacts—from droughts to floods to a proliferation of crop-destroying pests—for years. That’s why the Rainforest Alliance works with farmers to take a climate-smart approach. That means first assessing a farm’s particular climate risks, taking the crop and local ecosystem into account, then finding the right combination of tools to manage the farms climate challenges. That’s what makes climate-smart agriculture “smart.”\nTogether, we’re building a future where people and nature thrive. Sign up today and join our movement.\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n2. “Climate change is natural and normal—it’s happened at other points in history.”\nIt’s true that there have been periods of global warming and cooling—also related to spikes and lulls in greenhouse gases—during the Earth’s long history. But those historic increases in CO2 should be a warning to us: They led to serious environmental disruptions, including mass extinctions. Today, humans are emitting greenhouse gases at a far higher rate than any previous increase in history. (Before you collapse into a puddle of despair, however, find out about our work to promote natural climate solutions, like community forestry and regenerative agriculture.)\n3. “There’s no consensus among scientists that climate change is real.”\nWrong. There is nearly 100 percent agreement among scientists. Moreover, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that global warming is accelerating, and will reach 1.C above pre-Industrial levels around 2030—a full decade earlier than previously forecast.\n4. “Plants and animals can adapt.”\nWrong again. Because human-caused climate change is happening so rapidly, species simply don’t have time to adapt. Frogs tell the story best: With their semi-permeable skin, unprotected eggs, and reliance on external temperatures to regulate their own, they are often among the first species to die off when ecosystems tip out of balance—and they’re dying off in droves. The Rainforest Alliance chose a frog as its mascot more than 30 years ago precisely because it’s a bio-indicator: A healthy frog population signals a healthy ecosystem, which is what we’ve been working to promote—along with thriving communities—since 1987.\n5. “Climate change is good for us.”\nIt’s hard to even know where to begin to address this statement by climate change deniers, especially when you think about the human cost of a warming planet. The evidence points to a clear link between climate change and a surge in modern slavery: When crop failures, drought, floods, or fires wipe out livelihoods and homes, people migrate in the hopes of improving their lot—but can find themselves vulnerable to human trafficking and forced labor and other human rights abuses. And the overall economic cost is staggering: The global economy could lose $23 trillion to\nDoc 2(Title: When you think of space research, climate change probably isn’t the first thing that pops into your head. You’re more likely to picture astronauts floating around the International Space Station, or engineers designing rovers that can traverse volcanoes on Mars.) However, Earth is a planet too, and we can learn a great deal about our climate from the vantage point of space.\nTogether organisations like NASA and the European Space Agency have over 150 satellites in orbit around the planet. They are watching the oceans, land, ice, atmosphere and biosphere.\nHow do we know that the Earth is warming?\nIn 2015, 196 countries around the world signed up to the Paris Agreement (United Nations Climate Change). This ground-breaking legislation legally forces governments to curb their carbon emissions to limit global warming to less than 2°C.\nThis event was only possible because scientists had unequivocal proof that global temperatures have risen at unprecedented rates over the last century.\nBut how do scientists know that the Earth is warming?\nSatellites collecting data\nToday, hundreds of miles above the Earth’s surface, a vast network of satellites is collecting data on our planet’s climate system. These satellites provide accurate measurements of the temperature of our oceans, land and atmosphere.\nHowever, that wasn’t always the case. The first person to provide proof that the planet was heating up was actually a little-known amateur scientist called Guy Callendar.\nIn 1938, Callendar painstakingly collected records from 147 weather stations across the world. He discovered that global temperatures had risen 0.3°C over the previous 50 years.\nHowever, at the time his findings were largely ignored by:\n- governments\n- industries\n- even other scientists.\nIt wasn’t until the advent of satellites that Callendar’s measurements could be confirmed, and the world started to take notice.\nA new age of satellite observations\nThe first satellite to provide an accurate measurement of Earth’s atmospheric temperatures was NASA’s Nimbus III, which was launched in 1969.\nToday’s satellites are capable of much more sophisticated measurements. In Britain, huge advances in measuring global surface temperatures have been made by scientists at RAL Space. RAL Space is based at the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s (STFC) Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Didcot in Oxfordshire.\nMeasuring sea and land surface temperatures\nSince the 1980s, scientists at RAL Space have helped develop and calibrate a series of instruments that can measure sea and land surface temperatures to unprecedented accuracy.\nThis began with the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series. These were fitted on board the European Space Agency’s satellites:\n- ERS-1\n- ERS-2\n- Envisat.\nAfter the Envisat satellite retired in 2012, RAL Space developed the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) (STFC) for the sentinel satellites.\nThe satellites form part of the EU’s Copernicus Earth observation programme, which is providing us with an unprecedented picture of how Earth’s climate is changing.\nThere are two SLSTR instruments in orbit currently, and together they are able to cover almost all the globe in a day.\nThe importance of calibration\nA lot of work goes into designing, building, testing and calibrating a satellite instrument.\nDr Hugh Mortimer, a research scientist at STFC’s RAL Space explains why calibration, in particular, is important.\nIt’s vital that we can trust satellites and know that the data they provide us with is the truth.\nCalibration isn’t particularly sexy, but it is so important.\nIt underpins climate science and our trust in the data that is produced by NASA and the European Space Agency.\nYou cannot tweak or tune in space\nUnlike a car, which can be serviced in a garage, once the instrument is strapped to a rocket and launched into space you cannot tweak it or tune it.

It's not surprising that people think first of the most obvious part of our solar system, the Sun, when thinking about factors that warm Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is, after all, the provider of virtually all the energy in Earth's climate.\nNot surprising, but also not correct. Not correct, that is, when it comes to understanding the observed global temperature increases over roughly the past six decades. Over the past four decades, total solar irradiance has shown no particular trend. Given the Sun's slight cooling trend and the overall warming atmosphere, the Sun and the planet's climate actually have been moving in opposite directions.\nIt's a case where the scientific evidence refutes the easy or “knee-jerk” first-impulse, and in that respect it's not so unusual.\nLong-term solar output from the Sun, after all, strongly influences Earth's temperature and climate, but it cannot explain the increased warming during the Industrial Age. The National Research Council has reported that indirect estimates of solar output measured by sun spot activity in fact showed a slight increase during the first few decades of the 20th century, and those increases indeed may have contributed to warming during that period. But with satellite measurements available since 1979 having replaced less-precise sun spot observations, it is clear that solar output cannot be the major contributor to higher temperatures since the 1950s.\nAn extensive body of scientific research and evidence counters claims published in 1991 suggesting “strikingly good agreement” between solar cycle lengths and land surface temperatures between 1860 and 1990. That lone scientific study has given rise to much of the mistaken “It's the Sun” premise. Using various statistical and physical approaches, scientific researchers have shown relatively small solar contributions to global warming over the past half-century-plus, and supporting data from satellites and weather balloons have withstood vigorous scientific scrutiny in rejecting the notion that the Sun's output is responsible for warming during the latter part of the 20th century.\nOn the contrary, solar output calculations based on satellite data and sun spot activity and a range of independent measures of solar activity actually show a “slight cooling influence” in recent decades. Researchers Grant Foster and Stefan Rahmstorf, for instance, reported in 2011 that between 1979 and 2010 solar activity had a cooling effect of between -0.014 and -0.023Â°C. Researchers Judith Lean and David Rind earlier had found that solar activity can account for about 11 percent of global warming between 1889 and 2006, but only for about 1.6 percent of the warming between 1955 and 2005, with a slight cooling effect â about -0.004 degreesÂ°C â from 1979 to 2005.\nA Telltale Sign: Differences in Atmospheric Layers\nOne telltale sign the scientific community points to in concluding that solar radiation is not a major factor in recent warming involves differences between the troposphere, the lower layer of the atmosphere, and the stratosphere, the upper layer. The physics of increased solar output holds that there would be a uniform warming at all layers of the atmosphere as a result of increased solar radiation. But just the opposite has occurred: warming at the lower level and cooling at the upper layer.\n“This is exactly the vertical pattern of temperature changes expected from increased greenhouse gases, which traps energy closer to the Earth's surface,” according to the National Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences. “If an increase in solar output were responsible for the recent warming trend, the vertical pattern of warming would be more uniform through the layers of the atmosphere.”\nBut without tha\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that there is scientific proof for global warming.

It’s saying that something is off, and you are not feeling like you can trust your partner. If it doesn’t feel like he’s a safe person to bring around your children right now, then you have every right to limit his access to your kids, especially if you two live apart.\nCounseling\nAnother idea I want to mention is the option of getting your daughter involved with a therapist that she trusts – someone she can slowly build a relationship with and open up to as she’s ready. It sounds like, even without knowing whether he has sexually abused her, there is something she’s trying to express through her behaviors – something, clearly, is bothering her or stressing her out; she deserves an outlet for that. I’d encourage you to search for the therapist that is right for your daughter, as the right person (qualifications, personality, style) is key: this may mean talking to several to people on the phone, asking about their experience in the field and goals of treatment, and seeing if they align with what you’re looking for. The second or third person you meet may be the person that your daughter might really connect with.

Do you have allies in this situation, and other people to lean on? This is really difficult, and you also deserve somewhere to process how you’re feeling. This is certainly a topic that you deserve somewhere to explore more deeply, to ensure that you’re able to take the best next steps for yourself and your family. Reach out to people in your life – friends, relatives, members of your faith community or seek out your own professional therapist.

He told me that eight months previously, Julie, his fiancée, had discovered that he’d been having unprotected anal sex with men. When she confronted him, he denied it, but soon broke down and confessed. Devastated and angry, she broke off their engagement, accusing him of being duplicitous (she believed they were monogamous) and secretive. Worst of all, she felt frightened that he’d put her at risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.) Paul loved Julie and said he knew she was the woman for him. They’d dated for three years and been engaged for one. But Julie had rebuffed all his desperate and obsessive attempts to win her back. Ultimately, she’d had a restraining order issued against him. Shortly after this, Paul engaged in a binge of sexual acting-out with both men and women, culminating in the suicide attempt that brought him to my office.\nThe truth is that many men who have sex with men aren’t gay or bisexual. Although their confused mental and emotional state resembles that of the initial stages of coming out, gay men go on to develop a gay identity, whereas these men don’t.\nTherapists who treat such men need to realize that just because a client is sexual with the same gender doesn’t necessarily reflect his sexual or romantic orientation. While we may believe we’ve accurately assessed whether a client is gay, it isn’t up to us as therapists to make this judgment.\nUnderstanding Straight Men Who Have Sex with Men\nThere’s growing evidence that many men who have sex with men aren’t all gay or bisexual. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 3 million men who self-identify as straight secretly have sex with other men—putting their wives or girlfriends at risk for HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections.\nTo best treat these men, therapists and clients need to be able to differentiate four terms that are often confused: sexual identity and orientation; sexual preferences; sexual fantasies; and sexual behavior. Contrary to common usage, they aren’t always in alignment.\nSexual identity and orientation encompasses one’s sexual and romantic identity, in which thoughts, fantasies, and behaviors work together in concert. It’s the alignment of affectional, romantic, psychological, spiritual, and sexual feelings and desires for those of the same or opposite gender. Sexual orientation doesn’t change over time. One’s sexual behaviors and preferences might change, but like one’s temperament, one’s orientation remains mostly stable. The term also refers to how someone self-identifies, not how others may categorize him or her. Some people self-identify as straight, while others self-identify as gay or lesbian, bisexual, or questioning. It’s important as therapists to ask your clients how they self-identify, regardless of with whom they have sex.\nSexual preferences refer to sexual acts, positions, and erotic scenarios that someone prefers to have while engaging in sexual activity. The term takes into account what individuals like to do and get into sexually, not necessarily with whom they like to do it. Preferences and erotic interests can change over time, as one becomes more open or closed to certain thoughts and behaviors.\nSexual fantasies are any thoughts that one finds arousing. They can encompass anything—sexual positions, romantic encounters, body parts, clothing and shoe fetishes, even rape. Sexual fantasies aren’t necessarily acted out. In fact, in many cases, they aren’t.\nSexual behavior is any behavior intended to pleasure oneself and/or one’s sexual partner. It doesn’t necessarily reflect one’s orientation. For example, men who are imprisoned engage in sexual behaviors with other men, but do so out of sexual necessity, not because of erotic interest in another man.

Third, parental rights are limited by the interests of \nthe children, and while Roe establishes a right to end the life of a \nchild conceived but not yet born, it says nothing about ending the life \nof children living out of the womb.\n    It may be said that American law establishes a privacy interest in \ncoital reproduction. But even this has been limited to marriage. The \nprecedents leading to Roe fairly establish this. Harlan&#x27;s specific \nemphasis in Poe v. Ullman was that the state statute in question \ncriminalized marital use of contraception.\\\\47\\\\ While there may be a \nright to the use of contraceptives, even by minors, there is still no \nestablished liberty in premarital or extramarital sexual relations.\\\\48\\\\\n    Hence, nothing in Supreme Court case law jumps the gap between \ncoital and non-coital reproduction--to say nothing of the gap from \nsexual to asexual reproduction--and the reliance of the cases involving \ncoital reproduction on physical integrity cannot be extended to the \nextracorporeal use of germ cells to achieve in vitro fertilization. \nFinally, it is apparent in Robertson&#x27;s construction of his procreative \nliberty that the essence of this parental right is the exertion of \nparental will and desire, a notion of ownership, the imposition of \npersonal will, a conditional love or care. It is exactly this notion \nthat characterized the complete autonomy of the Roman father and was \nrepudiated by the common law.\n        b. the limits of roe&#x27;s right to \\`\\`terminate pregnancy&#x27;&#x27;\n    Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), properly understood on its own \nterms, dealt with a right to \\`\\`terminate pregnancy&#x27;&#x27; and nothing \nmore.\\\\49\\\\ It was entirely based on the physical impact of pregnancy on \na woman and her desire to rid herself of the pregnancy.\\\\50\\\\ As \nProfessor John Robertson acknowledges, Roe involved \\`\\`the physical \nburdens of bearing and giving birth.&#x27;&#x27; \\\\51\\\\ As the Court noted in \nHarris v. McRae, \\`\\`the Court in Wade emphasized the fact that the \nwoman&#x27;s decision carries with it significant personal health \nimplications--both physical and psychological.&#x27;&#x27; \\\\52\\\\ Roe created a \nnegative right to terminate a pregnancy without social (governmental) \nlimits; it did not establish a positive liberty to procreation or a \npositive liberty in non-coital reproduction. Roe created a right to \navoid procreation, not a right to procreate. This characterization was \nreaffirmed in Carey v. Populations Services International,\\\\53\\\\ and \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey.\\\\54\\\\ The central discussion of \n\\`\\`terminating pregnancy&#x27;&#x27; in Casey is concluded by a reference to \n\\`\\`these considerations of the nature of the abortion right. . . .&#x27;&#x27; \n\\\\55\\\\ Likewise, when the Court in Eisenstadt v. Baird refers to \\`\\`the \ndecision whether to bear or beget a child,&#x27;&#x27; \\\\56\\\\ it was understood to \nrefer to the literal physical burden of pregnancy.\\\\57\\\\ \\`\\`Terminating \npregnancy&#x27;&#x27; is the concept of the Roe liberty held by Justice Blackmun \nhimself.\\\\58\\\\\n    The limits of Roe are seen as well in the abortion-funding cases. \nIn Maher v. Roe,\\\\59\\\\ the Court held that \\`\\`the right protects the woman \nfrom unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether \nto terminate her pregnancy\\\\60\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; In Harris v. McRae,\\\\61\\\\ the Supreme \nCourt referred, more than once, to the Roe liberty as \\`\\`the freedom of \na woman to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy.\\\\62\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; The funding \ncases demonstrate that the states may \\`\\`make a value judgment favoring \nchildbirth over abortion&#x27;&#x27; and \\`\\`implement that judgment&#x27;&#x27; by the use \nof public funding.\n    The Roe abortion liberty as the basis for an unlimited right to \n\\`\\`procreative liberty&#x27;&#x27; is also severely limited by the fact that it \nexpressly and \nDoc 5(Title: S.Hrg. 107-1050 — HUMAN CLONING) \ne \ncommon phrase, being \\`\\`with child.\\\\106\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Early texts on midwifery, \nmedicine, and jurisprudence used the term \\`\\`child&#x27;&#x27; at any time of \npregnancy.\\\\107\\\\\n    Though limited by contemporary medicine, American law incorporated \na general rule of protection. Thus, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial \nCourt stated, \\`\\`\\[t\\]o many purposes, in reference to civil rights, an \ninfant in ventre sa mere is regarded as a person in being.\\\\108\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Or, \nas the New Jersey Supreme Court stated as long ago as 1849 in State v. \nCooper, \\`\\`\\[i\\]t is true, for certain civil purposes, the law regards an \ninfant as in being from the time of conception. . . . \\\\109\\\\ &#x27;&#x27;\n    The centuries during which legal protection was burdened by the \nlimitations of medical knowledge dwarf the relatively few, recent years \nwhen heightened medical knowledge has allowed treatment and surgery in \nutero. The novelty of medical technology that allows treatment and \nvisualization of the unborn human being was highlighted by the famous \nSwedish photographer, Lennart Nilsson. \\`\\`New technology has made it \npossible to see the actual events surrounding fertilization and to \nvisualize the growing fetus more clearly.\\\\110\\\\ &#x27;&#x27;\n                  b. quickening as an evidentiary line\n    With the limitations of medical knowledge, quickening was \nestablished centuries ago as the most reliable medical line showing \nevidence of life. From the fourteenth through the nineteenth centuries, \nquickening was the only reliable evidence that a woman was pregnant or \nthat the unborn human being was alive. As late as 1800, a standard text \non midwifery (the forerunner to obstetrics) concluded that \\`\\`there \nappears to be no unequivocal sign, whereby that state \\[pregnancy\\] can \nwith certainty be determined, till between the fourth and fifth \nmonths,when the child quickens, that is, when its motions are \ndistinctly felt.\\\\111\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Texts of midwifery typically contained \nchapters on the \\`\\`signs of pregnancy,&#x27;&#x27; in which quickening was \nemphasized.\\\\112\\\\ Thomas Denman, a widely cited authority on the \nsubject, expressed the developing understanding of quickening in his \n1829 text:\n\n          The changes which follow quickening have been attributed to \n        various causes. By some it has been conjectured, that the child \n        then acquired a new mode of existence; or that it was arrived \n        to such a size as to be able to dispense with the menstrous \n        blood, before retained in the constitution of the parent, which \n        it disturbed by its quantity or malignity. But it is not now \n        suspected, that there is any difference between the aboriginal \n        life of the child, and that which it possesses at any period of \n        pregnancy, though there may be an alteration in the proofs of \n        its existence, by the enlargement of its size, and the \n        acquisition of greater strength.\\\\113\\\\\n\nBeck, in his Elements of Medical Jurisprudence--one of the primary \nauthorities in the 19th century--emphasized the same understanding:\n\n          It is important to understand the sense attached to this word \n        \\[quickening\\] formerly, and at the present day. The ancient \n        opinion, on which indeed the laws of some countries have been \n        founded, was, that the foetus became animated at this period--\n        that it acquired a new mode of existence. This is altogether \n        abandoned. The foetus is certainly, if we speak \n        physiologically, as much a living being immediately after \n        conception, as at any other time before delivery; and its \n        future progress is but the development and increase of those \n        constituent principles which it then received.\\\\114\\\\\n\nWharton and Stille emphasized the same point:\n\n          This symptom \\[quickening\\] was formerly given much weight, \n        because at that time the c\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nIt appears these documents are discussing rights and legal structures broadly rather than providing specific statutes on age of consent.

The State shall protect it as the fundamental core of society and shall guarantee conditions that integrally favor the achieveme\nDoc 4(Title: S.Hrg. 107-1050 — HUMAN CLONING) \n children from coital reproduction and \nnothing more. Third, parental rights are limited by the interests of \nthe children, and while Roe establishes a right to end the life of a \nchild conceived but not yet born, it says nothing about ending the life \nof children living out of the womb.\n    It may be said that American law establishes a privacy interest in \ncoital reproduction. But even this has been limited to marriage. The \nprecedents leading to Roe fairly establish this. Harlan&#x27;s specific \nemphasis in Poe v. Ullman was that the state statute in question \ncriminalized marital use of contraception.\\\\47\\\\ While there may be a \nright to the use of contraceptives, even by minors, there is still no \nestablished liberty in premarital or extramarital sexual relations.\\\\48\\\\\n    Hence, nothing in Supreme Court case law jumps the gap between \ncoital and non-coital reproduction--to say nothing of the gap from \nsexual to asexual reproduction--and the reliance of the cases involving \ncoital reproduction on physical integrity cannot be extended to the \nextracorporeal use of germ cells to achieve in vitro fertilization. \nFinally, it is apparent in Robertson&#x27;s construction of his procreative \nliberty that the essence of this parental right is the exertion of \nparental will and desire, a notion of ownership, the imposition of \npersonal will, a conditional love or care. It is exactly this notion \nthat characterized the complete autonomy of the Roman father and was \nrepudiated by the common law.\n        b. the limits of roe&#x27;s right to \\`\\`terminate pregnancy&#x27;&#x27;\n    Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), properly understood on its own \nterms, dealt with a right to \\`\\`terminate pregnancy&#x27;&#x27; and nothing \nmore.\\\\49\\\\ It was entirely based on the physical impact of pregnancy on \na woman and her desire to rid herself of the pregnancy.\\\\50\\\\ As \nProfessor John Robertson acknowledges, Roe involved \\`\\`the physical \nburdens of bearing and giving birth.&#x27;&#x27; \\\\51\\\\ As the Court noted in \nHarris v. McRae, \\`\\`the Court in Wade emphasized the fact that the \nwoman&#x27;s decision carries with it significant personal health \nimplications--both physical and psychological.&#x27;&#x27; \\\\52\\\\ Roe created a \nnegative right to terminate a pregnancy without social (governmental) \nlimits; it did not establish a positive liberty to procreation or a \npositive liberty in non-coital reproduction. Roe created a right to \navoid procreation, not a right to procreate. This characterization was \nreaffirmed in Carey v. Populations Services International,\\\\53\\\\ and \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey.\\\\54\\\\ The central discussion of \n\\`\\`terminating pregnancy&#x27;&#x27; in Casey is concluded by a reference to \n\\`\\`these considerations of the nature of the abortion right. . . .&#x27;&#x27; \n\\\\55\\\\ Likewise, when the Court in Eisenstadt v. Baird refers to \\`\\`the \ndecision whether to bear or beget a child,&#x27;&#x27; \\\\56\\\\ it was understood to \nrefer to the literal physical burden of pregnancy.\\\\57\\\\ \\`\\`Terminating \npregnancy&#x27;&#x27; is the concept of the Roe liberty held by Justice Blackmun \nhimself.\\\\58\\\\\n    The limits of Roe are seen as well in the abortion-funding cases. \nIn Maher v. Roe,\\\\59\\\\ the Court held that \\`\\`the right protects the woman \nfrom unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether \nto terminate her pregnancy\\\\60\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; In Harris v. McRae,\\\\61\\\\ the Supreme \nCourt referred, more than once, to the Roe liberty as \\`\\`the freedom of \na woman to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy.\\\\62\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; The funding \ncases demonstrate that the states may \\`\\`make a value judgment favoring \nchildbirth over abortion&#x27;&#x27; and \\`\\`implement that judgment&#x27;&#x27; by the use \nof public funding.\n    The Roe abortion liberty as the basis for an unlimited right to \n\\`\\`procreative liberty&#x27;&#x27; is also severely limited by the fact that it \nexpressly and \nDoc 5(Title: S.Hrg. 107-1050 — HUMAN CLONING) \ne \ncommon phrase, being \\`\\`with child.\\\\106\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Early texts on midwifery, \nmedicine, and jurisprudence used the term \\`\\`child&#x27;&#x27; at any time of \npregnancy.\\\\107\\\\\n    Though limited by contemporary medicine, American law incorporated \na general rule of protection. Thus, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial \nCourt stated, \\`\\`\\[t\\]o many purposes, in reference to civil rights, an \ninfant in ventre sa mere is regarded as a person in being.\\\\108\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Or, \nas the New Jersey Supreme Court stated as long ago as 1849 in State v. \nCooper, \\`\\`\\[i\\]t is true, for certain civil purposes, the law regards an \ninfant as in being from the time of conception. . . . \\\\109\\\\ &#x27;&#x27;\n    The centuries during which legal protection was burdened by the \nlimitations of medical knowledge dwarf the relatively few, recent years \nwhen heightened medical knowledge has allowed treatment and surgery in \nutero. The novelty of medical technology that allows treatment and \nvisualization of the unborn human being was highlighted by the famous \nSwedish photographer, Lennart Nilsson. \\`\\`New technology has made it \npossible to see the actual events surrounding fertilization and to \nvisualize the growing fetus more clearly.\\\\110\\\\ &#x27;&#x27;\n                  b. quickening as an evidentiary line\n    With the limitations of medical knowledge, quickening was \nestablished centuries ago as the most reliable medical line showing \nevidence of life. From the fourteenth through the nineteenth centuries, \nquickening was the only reliable evidence that a woman was pregnant or \nthat the unborn human being was alive. As late as 1800, a standard text \non midwifery (the forerunner to obstetrics) concluded that \\`\\`there \nappears to be no unequivocal sign, whereby that state \\[pregnancy\\] can \nwith certainty be determined, till between the fourth and fifth \nmonths,when the child quickens, that is, when its motions are \ndistinctly felt.\\\\111\\\\ &#x27;&#x27; Texts of midwifery typically contained \nchapters on the \\`\\`signs of pregnancy,&#x27;&#x27; in which quickening was \nemphasized.\\\\112\\\\ Thomas Denman, a widely cited authority on the \nsubject, expressed the developing understanding of quickening in his \n1829 text:\n\n          The changes which follow quickening have been attributed to \n        various causes. By some it has been conjectured, that the child \n        then acquired a new mode of existence; or that it was arrived \n        to such a size as to be able to dispense with the menstrous \n        blood, before retained in the constitution of the parent, which \n        it disturbed by its quantity or malignity. But it is not now \n        suspected, that there is any difference between the aboriginal \n        life of the child, and that which it possesses at any period of \n        pregnancy, though there may be an alteration in the proofs of \n        its existence, by the enlargement of its size, and the \n        acquisition of greater strength.\\\\113\\\\\n\nBeck, in his Elements of Medical Jurisprudence--one of the primary \nauthorities in the 19th century--emphasized the same understanding:\n\n          It is important to understand the sense attached to this word \n        \\[quickening\\] formerly, and at the present day. The ancient \n        opinion, on which indeed the laws of some countries have been \n        founded, was, that the foetus became animated at this period--\n        that it acquired a new mode of existence. This is altogether \n        abandoned. The foetus is certainly, if we speak \n        physiologically, as much a living being immediately after \n        conception, as at any other time before delivery; and its \n        future progress is but the development and increase of those \n        constituent principles which it then received.\\\\114\\\\\n\nWharton and Stille emphasized the same point:\n\n          This symptom \\[quickening\\] was formerly given much weight, \n        because at that time the c\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nUpon reviewing the legislative references provided, none directly address specific age-of-consent laws globally relevant to the dating question asked.

The young women’s eating behaviours will be linked to the degree of body dissatisfaction and the frequency of using social media.\nHypothesis 4 (H4).\nThe young women’s body image and body description will be slightly connected to prenatal testosterone levels.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Design and Sample\nIn the first phase, a cross-sectional study was carried out focused on female college students, aged from 18 to 25 years. The sample was recruited to participate in an in-person survey from April to May 2018 from the University of Cordoba. The selection of the sample was based on non-probability convenience sampling. This method of sampling was selected based on the accessibility of the students and previous scheduling with the professors.\nThe final sample was constituted by 168 subjects, from biological, education, informatics and nursing degrees who agreed to participate in the study voluntarily. The initial sample was 224, though the final sample was 168 after applying the exclusion terms. The mean age of the sample was 20 ± 0.76.\n3.2. Measures\nAll the surveys used in the study are validated in different languages, including Spanish. Moreover, these surveys are used globally among health professionals and researchers in the health field [50].\nThe demographic and anthropometric data were not included in this study since the objective focused on the socio-cultural and individual factors. In this sense, the perception of young people was focused on social media, self-appearance, specific social network sites and distorted eating behaviours.\nThe EAT-26 with the reduced version of 26 items, was used to assess the frequency of disordered eating attitudes [51,52]. This test measures the low, medium and high risk of having a disordered eating attitude. Moreover, three different disordered eating behaviours can be reflected depending on the answers to each item. In this sense, these three subscales are dieting (focused on questions 1, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, 26), bulimia and food preoccupation (focused on questions 3, 4, 9, 18, 21, 25) and food oral control (2, 5, 8, 13, 15, 8, 20). Total scores were calculated by taking the sum of the 26 items, based on the value from 0 to 3, where higher scores, over 20 points, indicated higher levels of disordered eating behaviours. This validated survey based on screening disorder eating attitudes when the score is over 20 points [52]. Nevertheless, this survey does not provide a definite diagnosis of eating disorders; therefore, a clinical evaluation is needed. This evaluation can be carried out via individual interviews.\nThe body satisfaction questionnaire (BSQ) [53], whose Spanish adaptation was completed by Raich [54], was used. The stereotypes perception survey from the University of Granada was also used [55].\nThe questions referring to body image included illustrations of women’s bodies. These illustrations comprise seven body images that vary from underweight to obese, numbered from 1 to 7. Additionally, a specific section focused on body satisfaction, examining their satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 7, with lower scores relating to higher levels of body dissatisfaction. In this section, one of the questions examined the steps each young person would take to attain a body type that corresponded to the ideal.\nThe body image concerns were observed by using the BSQ, a self-report instrument evaluating weight and shape preoccupations [54]. Sample items include: “Have you been so worried about your shape that you have felt you ought to diet?”; “Have you noticed the shape of others and felt that your shape compared unfavourably?” The questions were answered on a six-point Likert scale (1 = never, five = always).\nThe Appearance Evaluation (AE) subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ) was used to measure self-perception and stereotypes [56]. Participants rate the extent to which they agree with seven statements (e.g., “Most people\nDoc 5(Title: y and to choose one’s place of residence or to freely enter and leave the country, whose exercise shall be regulated by law.

If you would like to help our coverage grow, consider donating to Ballotpedia.\nWhile serving as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Hillary Clinton said she exclusively used a private email account to send both personal messages and communications related to official State Department business.[1][2] By managing her email in this manner, Clinton potentially violated record-keeping, transparency, and security regulations.[3][4][5]\nThere were three lines of inquiry into Clinton's emails:\n- Several journalists and watchdog groups filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for Clinton's records, including her emails. The resulting federal court cases led to greater scrutiny of Clinton's private email server usage.[6]\n- The House Select Committee on Benghazi, which investigated how the State Department handled the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, requested information about the management of Clinton's private email server and communications related to Benghazi.[7]\n- In August 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation to determine whether classified documents were mishandled in relation to Clinton's private email server.[8]\nRegulations governing electronic document storage\nProtocol for the retention and security of official government documents is governed by several regulations: the Federal Records Act, guidelines issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Section 1924 under Title 18 of the United States Code.[14] Some of these rules were changed to more directly address electronic records after Clinton left her position as secretary of state in 2013.\nRegulations in place during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state\n- The Federal Records Act contains the following guidelines for record management:\n- The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) also offers guidance on record retention. In 1995, its regulations stipulated the following:\n- The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was created to \"foster democracy by ensuring public access to agency records and information.\"[19] Anyone can make a FOIA request for official government documents. If the information requested falls under one of nine exemption categories, it is not required to be disclosed. \"Information that is classified to protect national security\" is an example of an exemption category.[20]\n- 18 U.S.C. § 1924 makes it criminal for an employee or contractor of the United States to \"knowingly\" remove classified documents or retain them at \"an unauthorized location.\"[21]\nRegulations established after Clinton's tenure as secretary of state\nIn September 2013, NARA issued new guidance covering email usage. According to NARA, \"agency employees must ensure that all Federal records sent or received on personal email systems are captured and managed in accordance with agency recordkeeping practices.\"[22] The guidance also noted federal employees should not use personal email accounts for official business except where there is an emergency or issue with accessibility.[23]\nIn November 2014, President Barack Obama signed into law the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, which modernized regulations governing electronic document storage. The law updated the Federal Records Act to explicitly include electronic records in the definition of federal records and clarified the duties of federal officials who maintained non-government email systems.[24] One significant change in the law required federal employees who used \"a non-official electronic messaging account\" to copy the employee's official account when sending messages or forward the record no later than 20 days after it was created.[25]\nPotential liability\nClinton's potential criminal liability arose under 18 U.S.C. § 1924, the iss\nDoc 2(Title:  \"Clinton: ‘It’s time to move on’ from Benghazi,\" June 28, 2016) - ↑ House Select Committee on Benghazi, \"Report of the Democratic Members,\" accessed June 27, 2016\n- ↑ CNN, \"Democrats release Benghazi report,\" June 27, 2016\n- ↑ The New York Times, \"Inquiry Sought in Hillary Clinton’s Use of Email,\" July 23, 2015\n- ↑ Politico, \"New York Times alters Clinton email story,\" July 24, 2015\n- ↑ Politico, \"New York Times alters Clinton email story,\" July 24, 2015\n- ↑ The Washington Post, \"FBI looking into the security of Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail setup,\" August 4, 2015\n- ↑ The New York Times, \"F.B.I.

After Hurricane Sandy hit New York in October 2012 and the system crashed, Clinton hired Platte River Networks to manage the server and provide \"better security, durability, and a more professional setup.\"[33]) At some point after Clinton finished her service as secretary of state, the server was transferred to a data center in New Jersey.[34] According to U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) in March 2015, Clinton \"unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server.\"[35] David Kendall, Clinton's attorney, said that Clinton \"chose not to keep her non-record personal emails\" but \"has maintained and preserved copies\" of work-related communications.[35] On August 12, 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reportedly took possession of the email server.[34]\nThe Washington Post reported on September 12, 2015, that personal correspondence from Clinton's server could be recoverable. Platte River Networks, the company that managed the server beginning in 2013, said it had “no knowledge of the server being wiped.”[36] Datto, Inc., a private technology company hired by Platte River to produce backups of Clinton’s email accounts, announced on October 6, 2015, that it would provide the FBI with the data it had preserved from those accounts. Clinton consented to the release.[37]\nOn October 7, 2015, the Associated Press reported that hackers located in China, South Korea and Germany had attempted to infiltrate Hillary Clinton’s private email server in 2013. The cyberattacks were blocked by a “threat monitoring” service. It is not yet known whether the attempted attacks were targeted or a “nuisance” attack directed at servers around the world.[38]\nDiscovery of Clinton's private email server\nNews that Clinton used a private email account while working for the State Department first broke in March 2013 after a hacker, using the handle \"Guccifer,\" allegedly gained access to the email account of Sidney Blumenthal, an advisor to Clinton. Guccifer provided screenshots to media outlets showing Blumenthal sent numerous messages related to national security to hdr22@clintonemail.com, which many media outlets correctly presumed belonged to Clinton.[39][40][41]\nState Department officials contacted Clinton in the summer of 2014 after they discovered they did not have access to many of her emails. State Department spokesman John Kirby said, \"In the process of responding to congressional document requests pertaining to Benghazi, State Department officials recognized that it had access to relatively few email records from former Secretary Clinton. State Department officials contacted her representatives during the summer of 2014 to learn more about her email use and the status of emails in that account.”[42] In October 2014, the State Department requested the work-related emails of Clinton and other former secretaries of state after the State Department noted it also \"did not have extensive email records from prior Secretaries of State.\"[42]\nThe following month, the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested access to Clinton's emails regarding the 2012 attack in Benghazi. Clinton provided 300 emails. An additional set of emails, produced from other officials' email accounts, had been provided to the committee in August 2014 by the State Department.[1] On December 5, 2014, Clinton released 30,490 printed emails to the State Department. Another 31,830 emails were determined to be private and not released.[1]\nNearly three months later, on March 2, 2015, Michael Schmidt of The New York Times reported that Clinton \"exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state...and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be\nDoc 5(Title: and not released.[1]) Nearly three months later, on March 2, 2015, Michael Schmidt of The New York Times reported that Clinton \"exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state...and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be retained as part of the agency’s record.\"[43]\nClinton's public disclosures\nThe day after Schmidt's story was published in The New York Times, Clinton tweeted, \"I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.\"[1]\nDuring a press conference at the United Nations to discuss women's rights on March 10, 2015, Clinton made her first public address regarding the issue of her private email server. She said, \"I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.\"[44]\nClinton also noted that majority of the emails she sent were delivered to government employees with government addresses. Such messages were captured on the State Department system. She also provided the State Department with 55,000 pages' worth of emails per their request after she left office as secretary of state, but she retained personal emails unrelated to State Department business. Clinton also claimed she requested that the State Department make these emails available to the public.[44]\nPublic apology\nOn September 8, 2015, Clinton apologized for using the private email server while serving as secretary of state. She said, “I take responsibility and I am trying to be as transparent as I possibly can.”[45] Clinton told ABC News that her conduct had been a “mistake,” but she also said, “I am confident by the end of this campaign, people will know they can trust me, and that I will be on their side and I will fight for them and their families. But I do think I could have and should have done a better job answering questions earlier. I really didn’t, perhaps, appreciate the need to do that.”[45]\nClinton had previously avoided apologizing in an interview with NBC News' Andrea Mitchell on September 4, 2015. When Mitchell asked Clinton if she was sorry, she responded, \"Well, I certainly wish that I had made a different choice and I know why the American people have questions about it and I want to make sure that I answer those questions. Starting with the fact that my personal email use was fully above board, it was allowed by the State Department, as they have confirmed, but in retrospect, it certainly would have been better.”[46] CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod commented that Clinton’s evolving responses to the email investigation lengthened the process. “She's trying to bring this thing to an end so she can be heard on other subjects, but she needs a consistent answer,” said Axelrod.[47][48]\nState Department's disclosures\nFirst batch of emails released\nOn May 22, 2015, the State Department made public 296 emails related to Benghazi between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. They included initial exchanges between Clinton and her aides about when she should make a statement regarding the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens following the attack on the embassy. Two weeks later, Jacob Sullivan, a Clinton aide, sent a detailed 24-page study of every statement Clinton made after the attacks, assuring her, \"You never said spontaneous [sic] or characterized the motives. In fact you were careful in your first statement to say we were assessing motive and method.\"[49][50]\nClinton also received emails from Sullivan and other advisers on the fragile environment in Libya.

After Hurricane Sandy hit New York in October 2012 and the system crashed, Clinton hired Platte River Networks to manage the server and provide \"better security, durability, and a more professional setup.\"[33]) At some point after Clinton finished her service as secretary of state, the server was transferred to a data center in New Jersey.[34] According to U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) in March 2015, Clinton \"unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server.\"[35] David Kendall, Clinton's attorney, said that Clinton \"chose not to keep her non-record personal emails\" but \"has maintained and preserved copies\" of work-related communications.[35] On August 12, 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reportedly took possession of the email server.[34]\nThe Washington Post reported on September 12, 2015, that personal correspondence from Clinton's server could be recoverable. Platte River Networks, the company that managed the server beginning in 2013, said it had “no knowledge of the server being wiped.”[36] Datto, Inc., a private technology company hired by Platte River to produce backups of Clinton’s email accounts, announced on October 6, 2015, that it would provide the FBI with the data it had preserved from those accounts. Clinton consented to the release.[37]\nOn October 7, 2015, the Associated Press reported that hackers located in China, South Korea and Germany had attempted to infiltrate Hillary Clinton’s private email server in 2013. The cyberattacks were blocked by a “threat monitoring” service. It is not yet known whether the attempted attacks were targeted or a “nuisance” attack directed at servers around the world.[38]\nDiscovery of Clinton's private email server\nNews that Clinton used a private email account while working for the State Department first broke in March 2013 after a hacker, using the handle \"Guccifer,\" allegedly gained access to the email account of Sidney Blumenthal, an advisor to Clinton. Guccifer provided screenshots to media outlets showing Blumenthal sent numerous messages related to national security to hdr22@clintonemail.com, which many media outlets correctly presumed belonged to Clinton.[39][40][41]\nState Department officials contacted Clinton in the summer of 2014 after they discovered they did not have access to many of her emails. State Department spokesman John Kirby said, \"In the process of responding to congressional document requests pertaining to Benghazi, State Department officials recognized that it had access to relatively few email records from former Secretary Clinton. State Department officials contacted her representatives during the summer of 2014 to learn more about her email use and the status of emails in that account.”[42] In October 2014, the State Department requested the work-related emails of Clinton and other former secretaries of state after the State Department noted it also \"did not have extensive email records from prior Secretaries of State.\"[42]\nThe following month, the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested access to Clinton's emails regarding the 2012 attack in Benghazi. Clinton provided 300 emails. An additional set of emails, produced from other officials' email accounts, had been provided to the committee in August 2014 by the State Department.[1] On December 5, 2014, Clinton released 30,490 printed emails to the State Department. Another 31,830 emails were determined to be private and not released.[1]\nNearly three months later, on March 2, 2015, Michael Schmidt of The New York Times reported that Clinton \"exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state...and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information, Clinton's actions were potentially illegal according to federal requirements at the time.

Given historical context and the foundational principles of American democracy, especially constitutional checks and balances and the requirement for presidents to uphold the Constitution, it would be improbable without explicit legal challenge or constitutional amendment. Let's finalize:\n\nThe U.S. system inherently resists any communist president due to its structure and founding principles protecting liberty, democracy, and individual rights.\n\n<answer> no </answer>\n\nTherefore, the United States does not allow a communist president currently under its constitutional framework.",

And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.) That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, our development workers—they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million, lives were saved.\nThat's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it. It's the right thing to do.\nLet me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy. It set us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the cold war is over. Lift the embargo.\nThe point is, American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world—except when we kill terrorists—or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.\nWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, it's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now we're on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That's within our grasp. And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.\nThat's American strength. That's American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That's why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. There's a better way.\nAnd that's why we need to reject any politics—any politics—that targets people because of race or religion. Let me just say this. This is not a matter of political correctness, this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.\nHis Holiness Pope Francis told this body from the very spot that I'm standing on tonight that \"to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\" When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it what—telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country. \"We the People.\" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, that that's how we might perfect our Union. And that brings me to the fourth and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight.\nThe future we want—all of us want—opportunity\nDoc 2(Title: By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:) Section 1. Policy. Free speech is the bedrock of American democracy. Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The freedom to express and debate ideas is the foundation for all of our rights as a free people.\nIn a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators.\nThe growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology. Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms. As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square.\nTwitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see.\nAs President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes. It is essential to sustaining our democracy.\nOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other troubling behaviors, online platforms “flagging” content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any stated terms of service; making unannounced and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disfavoring certain viewpoints; and deleting content and entire accounts with no warning, no rationale, and no recourse.\nTwitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician’s tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called ‘Site Integrity’ has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.\nAt the same time online platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise restrict Americans’ speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China. One United States company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted searches for “human rights,” hid data unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party, and tracked users determined appropriate for surveillance. It also established research partnerships in China that provide direct benefits to the Chinese military. Other companies have accepted advertisements paid for by the Chinese government that spread false information about China’s mass imprisonment of religious minorities, thereby enabling these abuses of human rights. They have also amplified China’s propaganda abroad, including by allowing Chinese government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\nAs a Nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in\nDoc 3(Title: out a warrant? They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.) Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, \"If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States.\" I think that's exactly what he will do.\nBut as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died, because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.\nNow it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the, or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\nOur Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men - that we're to choose just between two personalities.\nWell what of this man that they would destroy, and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him \"when.\" I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.\nThis is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.\nAn ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, \"Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such,\" and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.\nDuring the hecti\nDoc 4(Title: thoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement.

But we have no desire to exchange freedom for equality. We are convinced ... that in no social order will freedom be assured as in a society based upon communal ownership.' Thus wrote the editors of the Journal of the Communist League in 1847, under the direct influence of the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.\n- ^ \"Где находится Екатериненштадт?

Let me try a more direct query.\n\n<search> does the United States allow a communist president </search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.) That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, our development workers—they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million, lives were saved.\nThat's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it. It's the right thing to do.\nLet me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy. It set us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the cold war is over. Lift the embargo.\nThe point is, American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world—except when we kill terrorists—or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.\nWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, it's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now we're on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That's within our grasp. And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.\nThat's American strength. That's American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That's why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. There's a better way.\nAnd that's why we need to reject any politics—any politics—that targets people because of race or religion. Let me just say this. This is not a matter of political correctness, this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.\nHis Holiness Pope Francis told this body from the very spot that I'm standing on tonight that \"to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\" When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it what—telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country. \"We the People.\" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, that that's how we might perfect our Union. And that brings me to the fourth and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight.\nThe future we want—all of us want—opportunity\nDoc 2(Title: By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:) Section 1. Policy. Free speech is the bedrock of American democracy. Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The freedom to express and debate ideas is the foundation for all of our rights as a free people.\nIn a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators.\nThe growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology. Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms. As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square.\nTwitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see.\nAs President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes. It is essential to sustaining our democracy.\nOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other troubling behaviors, online platforms “flagging” content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any stated terms of service; making unannounced and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disfavoring certain viewpoints; and deleting content and entire accounts with no warning, no rationale, and no recourse.\nTwitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician’s tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called ‘Site Integrity’ has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.\nAt the same time online platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise restrict Americans’ speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China. One United States company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted searches for “human rights,” hid data unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party, and tracked users determined appropriate for surveillance. It also established research partnerships in China that provide direct benefits to the Chinese military. Other companies have accepted advertisements paid for by the Chinese government that spread false information about China’s mass imprisonment of religious minorities, thereby enabling these abuses of human rights. They have also amplified China’s propaganda abroad, including by allowing Chinese government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\nAs a Nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in\nDoc 3(Title: out a warrant? They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.) Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, \"If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States.\" I think that's exactly what he will do.\nBut as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died, because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.\nNow it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the, or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\nOur Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men - that we're to choose just between two personalities.\nWell what of this man that they would destroy, and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him \"when.\" I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.\nThis is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.\nAn ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, \"Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such,\" and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.\nDuring the hecti\nDoc 4(Title: thoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement.

They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.) Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, \"If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States.\" I think that's exactly what he will do.\nBut as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died, because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.\nNow it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the, or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\nOur Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men - that we're to choose just between two personalities.\nWell what of this man that they would destroy, and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him \"when.\" I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.\nThis is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.\nAn ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, \"Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such,\" and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.\nDuring the hecti\nDoc 4(Title: re talking to a Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, \"We don't know how lucky we are.\" And the Cuban stopped and said, \"How lucky you are? I had someplace to escape to.\" And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.) And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man.\nThis is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down - [up] man's old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.\nIn this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the \"Great Society,\" or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say, \"The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism.\" Another voice says, \"The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state.\" Or, \"Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century.\" Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as \"our moral teacher and our leader,\" and he says he is \"hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document.\" He must \"be freed,\" so that he \"can do for us\" what he knows \"is best.\" And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as \"meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government.\"\nWell, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as \"the masses.\" This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, \"the full power of centralized government\"this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.\nNow, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85 percent of the farm surplus. Three-fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21 percent increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce. You see, that one-fourth of farming that's regulated and controlled by the federal government. In the last three years we've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow.\nSenator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater, as Presid\nDoc 5(Title:  14, 2020.) - McMurry, Evan (May 3, 2015). \"Bernie Sanders: America Should Look More Like Scandinavia\".

The featured experts also talk about the impact of human absence on the environment and the vestiges of civilization thus left behind. The series was preceded by a two-hour special that aired on January 21, 2008, on the History Channel which served as a de facto pilot for the series that premiered April 21, 2009. The documentary and subsequent series were both narrated by James Lurie.\nAfter a 15 year hiatus, History will air a new third season beginning July 14, 2025.[1][failed verification]\nFormat\n[edit]The program does not speculate on how humanity may disappear, stipulating only that it has, and that it has done so suddenly, leaving everything behind including household pets and livestock that have to fend for themselves. The thought experiment is based on documented results of the sudden removal of humans from a geographical area and thus, the discontinuation of the maintenance of buildings and urban infrastructure. Lurie's narration begins:\nWhat would happen if every human on Earth disappeared? This isn't the story of how we might vanish...it is the story of what will happen to the world we leave behind.\nThe series' episodes thematically offer examples of urban and biological decay. The focus is on specific locations such as skyscrapers, religious icons, bridges and dams, and government buildings, and the fate of certain related objects, such as artifacts, documents and human bodies. The fate of some kinds of flora and fauna are covered as well. Each episode also contains a segment in which experts examine real locations that have been abandoned by people, including ghost towns and other sites of deterioration, where the deterioration has been caused by events similar to those outlined in the episode. Although the series speculates on the fates of landmarks around the world, the main focus is on situations that may occur at locations in the United States.\nThe various events that may occur after people disappear suddenly are depicted using CGI dramatizations. The timeline of predicted events begins approximately one day after the disappearance of humankind and extends at various intervals up to one hundred million years into the future.\nBeginning with the third season, there is use of AI generated video. The new season's executive producer, Yoshi Stone, claimed that using AI technology helped them to \"react much more quickly and really expand our visual horizons\" at a lower cost. He cited Las Vegas as an example, in which he claimed that using AI helped them to visualize the entire city as a whole and not just limited to a single block or casino.[2]\nEpisodes\n[edit]Series overview\n[edit]Special (2008)\n[edit]Season 1 (2009)\n[edit]Season 2 (2010)\n[edit]Season 3 (2025)\n[edit]Home media\n[edit]A&E Home Video has released these DVDs:\nThat of the original documentary:\n- Life After People (History Channel)\n- UPC: 733961110906\n- Released 18 March 2008 on DVD\n- Runtime: 94 minutes\nThat of the first season of the series:\n- Life After People: The Complete Season One\n- UPC: 733961155303\n- Released 27 October 2009 on DVD\n- Runtime: 470 minutes\nThat of the second season of the series:\n- Life After People: The Complete Season Two\n- UPC: 733961221626\n- Released 27 July 2010 on DVD\n- Runtime: 425 minutes\nRatings\n[edit]The two-hour special documentary had an audience of 5.4 million viewers and was the most watched program ever on the History Channel.[3] The program was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 and narrated by Struan Rodger on May 29, 2008 and in Australia on Channel Seven on November 25, 2008, edited down to air for 90 minutes and included additional footage of a decaying Sydney Harbour Bridge, with narration by Australian television presenter Simon Reeve.[4]\nSee also\n[edit]- 10 Ways to End the World\n- Aftermath (TV series\nDoc 2(Title:  one that I had asked previously. I asked this professor what the process was by which the original life — the original living cells upon the earth — came into existence. How did the structure or generation of DNA occur? Once again, this man said, “Young man, that is not a question that falls within the realm of science.” In today's world we understand more about biochemical processes, but we cannot answer how in the environment of the primitive earth these processes came into operation. I guess what was happening to me was the same thing that Lord Kelvin, a very famous British scientist, described in his writings when he made the statement, “If you study science deep enough and long enough it will force you to believe in God.” That is what happened to me. I began to realize that science had its limitations — that science, in fact, strongly pointed to other explanations than natural ones to certain questions.) It was about this time when another thing happened in my life and that was, a woman entered it. A lot of things begin with women (some things end with them, too). In this particular case, this young lady was by all means the most bull-headed, stubborn, cast-iron willed individual I had ever met in all my life. I can make those statements because some six years later I married her. This was the first girl I ever met that I felt I could respect. Sometimes you will hear preachers, who know absolutely nothing about what they are talking about from the role of experience, make statements such as, “If you hold on to your virtues and maintain your moral standards, a man will respect you more.” Let me tell you, as one who has lived on the other side of the fence and has thought as one who is alienated from how God thinks, that statement is true. I will guarantee you that I never thought seriously about marrying anyone until I met this girl whom I could respect — who really stood for something. Not only did she stand for something morally, she believed in God and read her Bible. Though she could not answer all my questions, she kept going back to the Bible. I also learned quickly not to let her know what I was really like morally. I knew if she really knew that, she would have nothing to do with me. I did not seem to be able to break her faith as I had been able to do with other people and the thing that happened was that as a result of her stubbornness and refusal to reject the Bible, she forced me to read the Bible.\nI read the Bible through from cover to cover four times during my sophomore year in college for the explicit purpose of finding scientific contradictions in it. By that, I mean statements in the Bible that were false that I could throw back at her to show her how ridiculous it was to believe in God. I had even decided to write a book called All the Stupidity of the Bible. Something amazing happened as I did this. As I considered and thought about these things, I found that I could not find a contradiction — to find some kind of scientific inaccuracy in the Bible. I just simply was not able to do it. I gave up writing the book because of lack of material! It is amazing to me that as I talk to people, I find many who claim to be Christians and who perhaps claim to have been Christians for many years who have not read the Bible through cover to cover once. I find it hard to believe that they believe in God very much if they do not even want to know what he has to say.\nAs I read the Bible through again and again, I began to realize that not all of the things I had been told about God and religion were what the Bible said. They may have been what organized religion said or what some men taught, but not what the Bible itself said. For example, the Bible did not say that God was an old man floating around in the sky, blasting things into existence here upon the earth. The Bible said, “God is a spirit: …” (John 4:24) and that God is not flesh and blood. Jesus made the statement, “… for flesh and blood hath not revealed it un\nDoc 3(Title: the problem of inherited behavior patterns and increase the sustainability of technological civilization\".

Have you ever wondered why it is that when a person gets clean from drugs, gets rid of the problem of alcohol, or conquers some of the problems like the ones I had, that the person always seems to get involved in some religious cause, halfway house, or something like that? Why is that? I can tell you from my own experience that we have learned that the only place you find happiness is in using God's system — in following God's way. Perhaps people that have lived without God appreciate so much more than people that have grown up in religious structures — what you have in the church. You do not find happiness living your own system, but only in living God's way and in being a part of God's system.) As perhaps you are beginning to realize as we get into this discussion more thoroughly, there were a variety of things that led me to believe in God. One other thing that I think ought to be mentioned is the fact that I entered a period of military service about this time. For the first time in my life, I came in contact with death. I began to think about the reasonableness of death as I Iooked at it as an atheist. Perhaps a more accurate way to describe this was the way that I had to look at life because of death. As an atheist, I realized that I had to look at life with all of its problems, difficulties, and terrible things that I experienced as the best thing that I could ever look forward to. Yet I realized that as a Christian, I would be able to look at life with all of its joys, beauties, and wonderful things that we all enjoy as the absolute worst that I was ever going to have to experience. Yet from a philosophical point, I began to realize that Christianity offered a great deal in this particular area. I did not get scared into believing in God, but I think this area together with all these other things helped me to realize that there really was quite a change in my understanding of what Christianity and God are all about. I began to recognize that perhaps there were some things about the church and what it had to offer that were important to me.\nAbout this time in my life, I decided that other religious systems might be as good as the Bible. To check them out, I began reading the Vedas, Koran, Sayings of Buddha, writings of Bahá'u'lláh and Zoroaster and found that other religions taught many things I could not accept. There were teachings in their writings concerning what life was like after this life that were unrewarding and unrealistic and there were descriptions of God that were illogical and inconsistent. There were also many scientific inaccuracies in their works. There were many teachings about life and how to live it that were not workable. This included the role and position of women in the Koran, the Holy War concept of Mohammed, the pantheism of nearly all other systems, reincarnation, idol worship, polygamy, and a myriad of ideas which I had expected to find in the Bible, but did not. I began to realize that nothing matched the Bible's system of life. Only in the Bible could I see statements which would stand in the face of the scientific facts that I knew to be true and only the Bible offered a system of life that I felt was reasonable and consistent. I decided that if I ever came to believe in God, it would be a belief based upon the Bible.\nThe next question was that if I ever became a believer in God, which of all the religious organizations claiming to be Christianity would be the correct one. I recognized that I did not want to be a part of all these traditional religious bodies that taught the error that I had been taught and had believed in my early years,\nDoc 5(Title: S.Hrg. 107-1050 — HUMAN CLONING) \nuld have us countenance the entire \npractice of human cloning, the consequences be damned.\n    But we dare not be complacent about what is at issue, for the \nstakes are very high indeed. Human cloning, though partly continuous \nwith previous reproductive technologies, is also something radically \nnew, both in itself and in its easily foreseeable consequences--\nespecially when coupled to powers for genetic \\`\\`enhancement&#x27;&#x27; and germ-\nline genetic modification that may soon become available, thanks to the \nrecently completed Human Genome Project. I exaggerate, but in the \ndirection of the truth: we are compelled to decide nothing less than \nwhether human procreation is going to remain human, whether children \nare going to be made-to-order rather than begotten, and whether we wish \nto say yes in principle to the road that leads to the dehumanized hell \nof Brave New World.\n    Four years ago, I addressed this subject in these pages, defending \nand trying to articulate the moral grounds of our repugnance at the \nprospect of human cloning (\\`\\`The Wisdom of Repugnance,&#x27;&#x27; TNR, June 2, \n1997; see also Leon R. Kass and James Q. Wilson, The Ethics of Human \nCloning, 1998). Though I will (without apology) revisit some of my \nformer arguments--events since then have only strengthened my \nconviction that cloning is a bad idea whose time should not come--my \nemphasis this time is more practical. To be sure, I would still like to \npersuade undecided readers that cloning is a serious evil, both in \nitself and in what it leads to. But I am more interested in encouraging \nthose who oppose human cloning but who think we are impotent to prevent \nit; and I hope to mobilize them to support new and solid legislative \nefforts to stop it. In addition, I want readers who may worry less \nabout cloning and more about impending prospects of germline genetic \nmanipulation or other eugenic practices to realize the unique practical \nopportunity now available to us.\n    For we have here a golden opportunity to exercise some control over \nwhere biology is taking us. Cloning technology is discrete and well-\ndefined, and requires considerable technical know-how and dexterity; we \ncan therefore know by name many of the likely practitioners. The public \ndemand for cloning is extremely low; most people are decidedly against \nit; nothing scientifically or medically important would be lost by \nbanning clonal reproduction; alternative and non-objectionable means \nare available to obtain some of the most important medical benefits \nclaimed for (non-reproductive) human cloning; commercial interests in \nhuman cloning are, for now, quite limited; and the nations of the world \nare actively seeking to prevent it. Now may be as good a chance as we \nwill ever have to get our hands on the wheel of the runaway train now \nheaded for a post-human world and to steer it toward a more dignified \nhuman future.\n    Before making my case, that we might proceed on common ground, I \noffer a brief synopsis of the state of the art.\n                       what&#x27;s wrong with cloning?\n    What is cloning? Cloning, or asexual reproduction, is the \nproduction of individuals who are genetically identical to an already \nexisting individual. The procedure&#x27;s name is fancy--somatic cell \nnuclear transfer--but its concept is simple. Take a mature but \nunfertilized egg; remove or inactivate its nucleus; introduce a nucleus \nobtained from a specialized (i.e., somatic) cell of an adult organism. \nOnce the egg begins to divide, transfer the little embryo to a woman&#x27;s \nuterus to initiate a pregnancy. Since almost all the hereditary \nmaterial of a cell is contained within its nucleus, the re-nucleated \negg and the individual into which it develops are genetically identical \nto the organism that was the source of the transferred nucleus.\n    An unlimited number of genetically identical individuals--a clone--\ncould be produced by nuclear tran\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that the concept of life after life is often explored in documentaries and discussions regarding the future of Earth without humans, but it is not scientifically proven.

Garbage. Lock her up. Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean toward either party. Slightly more, 63 percent overall, viewed Trump unfavorably; 62 percent of independents. It’s those independents that Trump’s campaign hopes it can peel off — if it can keep up a steady drumbeat of negativity about Clinton. Three-quarters of voters in the poll said their pick for president is motivated by a desire to cast their ballot against either Clinton or Trump. Still, the criticism has triggered a backlash from some Republicans who say it’s beyond the pale. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who’s skipping the GOP convention, tweeted that Republicans “can make the case that she shouldn’t be elected without jumping the shark.” And Bill Pickle, a South Carolina delegate and talk radio host, said those doing the name-calling “sound and act like demons.” “I personally hate — I mean hate — all of the negativity,” Pickle said. “What happened to professionalism, manners and humanity in our politicians and citizens?” But most Republicans seem unperturbed. Wisconsin delegate Jim Geldreich said the stay-on-offense strategy was spot-on. Clinton, meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage. She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter th) \nDoc 2(Title:  meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage.

Johnny McMahan, 65, a GOP delegate from Arkansas, said he had no problem with a woman being president but some of his friends felt differently. “They say women are too emotional to be president,” McMahan said. Though assailing the opposing candidate is standard fare at political conventions, this year the attacks have transcended policy positions and become intimately personal. The relentless spotlight on an opponent’s supposed criminality is another departure. Republicans maintain Clinton broke the law by sending classified information on her private email server. Trump’s campaign has worked to sow distrust by using vague insinuations against Clinton that are hard to prove or disprove. On Wednesday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort mused that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had “probably” given special information to Bill Clinton that helped his wife avoid criminal charges, during a brief airport meeting that Lynch has acknowledged was a mistake. He said the “Lock her up!” chant punctuating speeches at the conventions “probably reflects the attitude of a lot of people in America.” “They don’t understand why justice wasn’t done,” he said.

A recent poll indicated that a substantial percentage of American citizens would be willing to give up some protections of the Bill of Rights in order to control illegal drug use.\nSeveral years ago Congress passed a law authorizing federal authorities to confiscate the property of individuals suspected of trafficking in drugs. Such property could be seized on mere suspicion. Individuals whose property had been seized could appeal and seek a return of their property, but the burden of proof rested on them to prove their innocence.\nAdvocates of this law argued its constitutionality on the grounds that the government was not acting against the suspected individuals, only against their property. Since only individuals, and not property, enjoy the protection of the Bill of Rights, they said, the law did not violate the Constitution.\nSince going into effect the law has proved controversial. Congress may repeal it. Do you think it should be repealed? Even if the constitutionality of such a law is upheld, should the government have such power?

Educators differ about how best to accomplish their tasks. Moreover, a large percentage of recent immigrants use Spanish as their first language.

TRUMP, PETITIONER v. CYRUS R. VANCE, JR., IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK, ET AL., RESPONDENTS) \nO**\n\n**AVOIDS CRIMINAL PROCESS FOR 8 YEARS**\n\nBy the way, Amicus is not going to cite much case\n\nlaw in this brief, as Respondent has done an\n\nexcellent job in that category. However, Amicus will\n\nmention _Citizens United v. Federal Election_\n\n_Commission_, 558 U.S. 310 (2010)_,_ for its use in\n\ncombatting government oppression.\n\nIn very broad brush, that case was about people\n\nnot having to be punished if, say, they wrote or\n\ndisseminated a book attacking Hillary Clinton too\n\nclose to an election. _See id. passim_. Amicus, though\n\nhe supports campaign finance reform and thinks\n\nthere is too much big money in politics, can still\n\nagree with much of the message of _Citizens United_,\n\n_supra_, since punishing someone for writing or\n\ndistributing a book is not always a good idea.\n\nHowever, what if Clinton had become President?\n\nUnder the views of Petitioner in the instant case,\n\n21\n\nshe, once in office, could literally shoot anyone who\n\ncriticized her, and go not just unpunished, but even\n\nuninvestigated, for up to eight years (two terms in\n\noffice). On a more realistic level than shooting\n\npeople, she could indulge in spying, harassment,\n\nWatergate-style break-ins, criminal libel, financial\n\nfraud and skulduggery, etc., against any critic, and\n\nbe free from criminal process while “enthroned” as\n\nPresident. So, under _Citizens United_, a critic cannot\n\nbe harassed for merely writing a book about Mrs.\n\nClinton; but if she is President, then, per Petitioner,\n\nClinton can _kill_ that same critic, or perform other\n\nabuses against him, for years, without being subject\n\nto investigation/indictment/incarceration. That\n\nresult cannot be right, and Amicus urges common\n\nsense on the Court.\n\nSpeaking of books, one famous trilogy may have\n\nlessons here, just as one prominent judge may have\n\nthought it had lessons in another issue…\n\n**X. THE CORRUPTIVE “RING OF**\n\n**INVISIBILITY” THAT THE COURT SHOULD**\n\n**NOT GIVE TO CRIMINAL PRESIDENTS**\n\nRumor has it that a junior Member of the Court\n\nrecently compared nationwide injunctions to the\n\ndomineering effect of the “One Ring” from J.R.R.\n\nTolkien’s _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy. Such a\n\ncomparison may or may not be accurate (e.g., if\n\nSauron of Mordor is considered as an oppressive\n\ngovernment power; and injunctions _prevent_\n\n(putatively-)oppressive government powers from\n\nbeing wielded: then injunctions hardly further the\n\nDark Lord’s purposes…); but an even more apt use\n\n22\n\nfor the Ruling Ring is to describe the exemption of\n\nthe President from criminal process or punishment.\n\nThat is, the Ring has traditional powers not just\n\nof dominion, but also of invisibility, and moral\n\ncorruption (meanness, egotism, etc.) of the wielder—\n\neven the markedly virtuous Frodo Baggins—, _see id._\n\n_passim_. As previously discussed, lack of criminal\n\ninvestigation leaves the public in the darkness about\n\nwhat evil the Chief Executive may have done; and\n\nthat darkness, with its temptation to the President\n\nto do evil acts invisibly, without fear of punishment\n\n(at least until his presidency is over—and he may\n\nnot even live long after that anyway), has obvious\n\npotential to corrupt. (The whole Enlightenment\n\nproject represented by these democratic United\n\nStates, cannot work in the dark.)\n\nAnd Lord Acton chimes with _Lord of the Rings_\n\nwhen he says that “absolute power corrupts\n\nabsolutely.” Letter to Archbishop Mandell Creighton\n\n(Apr. 5, 1887). The Court should not create occasions\n\nfor the corruption of the President, who should be a\n\ndevoted leader, not a dark lord.\n\nIndeed, who needs an invisible man lurking at\n\nthe heart of the State? a walking black hole or black\n\nbox, who cannot even be investigated for his crimes?\n\n_Cf._ the current film _The Invisible Man_ (Blumhouse\n\nProductions 2020; from the H.G.

Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Efficiency and Optimization**: AI can help optimize the use of scarce resources, especially during pandemics where hospitals operate on tight margins and need to manage limited supplies effectively.\n\n2. **Complex Decision-Making**: Resource allocation during a crisis can be extremely complex and time-consuming.

AI/ML-based tools are increasingly used to aid with health care operations — allocating or otherwise optimizing resources.\nHospitals often operate on relatively slim margins (especially since the onset of the pandemic), so using AI to increase efficiency and optimize the use of scarce resources makes sense.\nOptimizing scarce resources is particularly important, as such resource allocation decisions can be fraught and take time that hospital staff may not have. Allocating scarce resources is generally governed by medical ethics. Especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, ethical approaches to resource allocation abound.\nAlgorithms may recommend who should receive limited assets, like hospital beds, or limited personnel resources, like clinician time. For example, a hospital may use an algorithm that predicts patient deterioration from COVID-19 to allocate ventilators. Or, a health system may use an algorithm that predicts a patient’s risk of severe illness to allocate care management resources.\nRisks And Impacts Of Resource Allocation Algorithms\nHealth care algorithms used to allocate resources do not carry the same risk to individual patient health as, say, an algorithm that diagnoses breast cancer based on MRI scans. However, the use of resource allocation algorithms does impact access to care and the level of care patients receive. When an algorithm is biased, hospitals may deny patients needed resources.\nIn a well-known example, an algorithm designed to allocate care management resources under-estimated the care needs of Black patients and over-estimated the care needs of white patients. Black patients were therefore less likely to receive enhanced care management than white patients.\nOn a population level, biased or improperly used resource allocation algorithms can worsen existing inequities in health care. If an algorithm is less likely to recommend enhanced resources to Black and Brown patients, health systems may withhold more resources from already underserved patient populations.\nDespite their potential for harm, these algorithms remain unregulated.\nThe Regulatory Gap\nUnlike clinical algorithms, resource allocation algorithms cannot be regulated by the FDA as a medical device. These algorithms fall well outside the definition of a medical device, as they focus on the provision and administration of health care.\nHospitals may decide to use resource allocations algorithms based on concerns of biased clinician decision-making. Providers may prefer that an algorithm make these frequent but difficult decisions. Health systems may view these tools as impartial when they in fact can encode the existing bias in health care.\nBut without a regulatory framework, health care organizations are ill-equipped to quantify the risk associated with implementing these algorithms. Resource allocation algorithm vendors are not required to share algorithm development information with regulators or purchasing health care organizations. Therefore, hospitals may not know whether the algorithm was trained on a diverse data set or whether the algorithm has been sufficiently tested. Despite their experience navigating complex ethical waters in resource allocation, they still may not catch algorithmically encoded bia\nDoc 2(Title: care organizations. Therefore, hospitals may not know whether the algorithm was trained on a diverse data set or whether the algorithm has been sufficiently tested. Despite their experience navigating complex ethical waters in resource allocation, they still may not catch algorithmically encoded bias.) Hospital Oversight\nWithout regulatory oversight, health care organizations should take particular care when implementing resource allocation algorithms. Health systems should work with algorithm developers to ensure that resource allocation algorithms were trained on diverse data sets. They should also ask developers to outline the algorithm’s inputs and consider whether those factors could lead to bias. Finally, implementing health systems should test the algorithms in their own system. Health systems should pay particular attention to whether algorithms over- or under-recommend additional resources for specific patient populations.\nHealth systems that implement resource allocation algorithms without sufficient oversight may worsen the inequities that they intend to alleviate.\nDoc 3(Title: Abstract) Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving tool revolutionizing many aspects of healthcare. AI has been predominantly employed in medicine and healthcare administration. However, in public health, the widespread employment of AI only began recently, with the advent of COVID-19. This review examines the advances of AI in public health and the potential challenges that lie ahead. Some of the ways AI has aided public health delivery are via spatial modeling, risk prediction, misinformation control, public health surveillance, disease forecasting, pandemic/epidemic modeling, and health diagnosis. However, the implementation of AI in public health is not universal due to factors including limited infrastructure, lack of technical understanding, data paucity, and ethical/privacy issues.\nKeywords: artificial intelligence (AI), public health, healthcare, review, health policy\n1. Introduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a vast field that includes a variety of methodologies, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning (1). These methods are useful for pattern recognition, prediction, and large-scale data analysis. AI has the potential to be transformative within the healthcare domain. AI has been applied to disease diagnostics, helped forecast the development of infectious diseases, and find novel medication targets (2). AI has also been used to guide interpretation of medical imagining, and drug discovery and delivery (3). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a shift in the exploitation of AI from medicine to public health. During the pandemic, AI was integral to forecasting COVID-19 spread, contact tracing, pharmacovigilance, and rapid testing and detection (4, 5). The implementation of some of these epidemiology informatics tools aided global efforts to cut the spread of the COVID-19 virus and improved patient care. Table 1 highlights some examples of how AI was employed to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTable 1.\nOther potential advantages of AI for public health including increased effectiveness, precision, and scalability of public health treatments. AI can also assist in locating novel insights and patterns that human analysts might miss (18). There are, however, significant ethical and regulatory concerns that must be addressed, such as data privacy and bias in AI systems. In addition, the exploitation of AI to improve public health is not spread evenly across the globe. Some of the major factors that potentially impede the advancement of AI in public health are data availability/governance, availability of related infrastructure, technical skills gap, and the possibility of inequity/bias due to data discrepancies (19). To ensure that the technology is used ethically and responsibly, researchers, healthcare practitioners, and policymakers must work together to integrate AI into healthcare systems. This article reviews recent trends in AI for public health and considers both the potential benefits and challenges of this technology.\n2. Methods\nThis study employed a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Scoping Review approach to comprehensively explore the application of AI to improve public health (20, 21). Relevant electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) were carefully searched using appropriate keywords and controlled vocabulary terms related to AI and public health. Initial screening of titles and abstracts was conducted to identify potentially relevant studies. Full-text articles of the selected studies were retrieved and evaluated for eligibility based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies that focused on the application of AI in public health and were published in English. Exclusion criteria included studies unrelated to public health, studies published in languages other than English, and studies lacking full-text availability.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the rapid growth of telemedicine worldwide. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into telemedicine has the potential to enhance and expand its capabilities in addressing various healthcare needs, such as patient monitoring, healthcare information technology (IT), intelligent diagnosis, and assistance. Despite the potential benefits, implementing AI in telemedicine presents challenges that can be overcome with physician-guided implementation. AI can assist physicians in decision-making, improve healthcare delivery, and automate administrative tasks. To ensure optimal effectiveness, AI-powered telemedicine should comply with existing clinical practices and adhere to a framework adaptable to various technologies. It should also consider technical and scientific factors, including trustworthiness, reproducibility, usability, availability, and cost. Education and training are crucial for the appropriate use of new healthcare technologies such as AI-enabled telemedicine. This article examines the benefits and limitations of AI-based telemedicine in various medical domains and underscores the importance of physician-guided implementation, compliance with existing clinical practices, and appropriate education and training for healthcare providers.\nKeywords: Artificial intelligence (AI), COVID-19, intensive care unit (ICU), telemedicine, telehealth, tele-ICU\nIntroduction\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and telemedicine represents a state-of-the-art solution in the healthcare industry that boosts medical care accessibility, efficiency, and quality.[1] This integration offers limitless opportunities for tailoring healthcare solutions using AI to cater to specific needs. Telemedicine assisted by AI can improve the patient experience, healthcare outcomes, and the quality of services offered by physicians. By speeding up disease screening and diagnosis, making diagnoses more precise and personalized, and decreasing the necessity for in-person consultations, AI can exhibit a very important role in promoting and facilitating access to integrated health care throughout a person's lifespan. In managing chronic diseases, AI-enabled remote care can enhance communication and connections across various healthcare delivery elements, enabling healthcare professionals for interaction and providing a knowledge repository for managing patients.[2]\nTelemedicine and its importance\nTelemedicine is defined by the World Health Organization as using information and communication technologies to provide healthcare services when distance is a critical factor.[3] The definition encompasses several aspects, such as diagnosing, treating, preventing diseases and injuries, conducting research, and providing continuing education to healthcare providers, with the final aim to promote the health of individuals and communities. Telemedicine is a healthcare method and not a tool; it can be carried out through different modalities, such as live video consultations or store-and-forward messaging systems. Although terms such as telemedicine and telehealth are frequently used interchangeably,[4] they carry separate technical and regulatory definitions, and other terms such as digital health and mobile health are used to provide a broader and more comprehensive view of people's health care in the digital age.\nTelemedicine refers specifically to the provision of healthcare services and consultations through remote technologies such as videoconferencing, while telehealth is a broader term that includes all healthcare services delivered through technology, including remote monitoring, patient education, and medical record management.\nIn other words, telemedicine is a subset of telehealth, which encompasses a wider \nDoc 5(Title: Powering the Digital Economy: Opportunities and Risks of Artificial Intelligence in Finance) \ntwork effects, which could increase the financial system’s vulnerability to single points of failure.\n    \n*   ■ The concentration of third-party AI/ML algorithm providers could drive greater homogeneity in risk assessments and credit decisions in the financial sector, which, coupled with rising interconnectedness, could create the conditions for a buildup of systemic risks. The likely concentration of data and growing use of alternative data in AI/ML could result in, respectively, the risk of uniformity (herding) and out-of-sample risk that eventually could lead to systemic risk.\n    \n*   ■ The widespread use of AI/ML could potentially increase procyclicality of financial conditions. For instance, credit underwriting and risk management processes are inherently procyclical, reacting to financial conditions in ways that reinforce and amplify those changes (that is, falling default rates lead to more lending, which can further lower default rates). AI/ML may automate and accelerate the procyclicality and potentially obscure it (due to explainability issues).\n    \n*   ■ Moreover, in the case of a tail risk event, an inaccurate risk assessment and reaction by ML algorithms could quickly amplify and spread the shock throughout the financial system and complicate or even undermine the effectiveness of the policy response.\n    \n*   ■ Challenges in interpretation, sustainability of analytical power, and prediction of models raise the concern that economic policies or market strategies based on these models will be challenging to interpret or predict by the relevant counterparties, creating additional asymmetric information in the market, with an uncertain impact on financial stability.\n    \n*   ■ Finally, regulatory gaps could adversely impact financial stability if technological advances outpace existing regulations. Such advances are often led by providers who may fall outside existing regulatory perimeters.[21](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn21)\n    \n\nThe rapid evolution of AI/ML has led to a range of regulatory responses. While some jurisdictions have taken a more holistic approach to addressing the issues involved (for example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore[22](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn22) and De Nederlandsche Bank[23](https://elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/087/2021/024/article-A999-en.xml#A001fn23)), others have concluded that existing regulations and expectations on good governance are sufficient to address the emerging issues. Whether it is by way of new regulations or existing ones, regulators have generally focused on AI/ML governance frameworks, risk management, internal controls, and better controls over the model and data.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires broad regulatory and collaborative efforts. An adequate policy response requires developing clear minimum standards and guidelines for the sector, coupled with stronger focus on securing the necessary technical skills. Given the inherent interconnectivity of issues related to the deployment of AI/ML systems in the financial sector, collaboration among financial institutions, central banks, financial supervisors, and other stakeholders is important to avoid duplication of work and to help counter potential risks. Many leading jurisdictions in the AI/ML sector have relied on well-articulated national AI strategies for promoting AI/ML development while ensuring that regulatory gaps do not materialize. Annex 3 provides an overview of country approaches to developing AI national strategies.\n\n4\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nThe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems in the financial sector will continue to accelerate. This trend is driven by rapid increases in computational powers, data storage capacity, and big data, as well as by signifi\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems acceptable for healthcare providers to use AI algorithms to allocate resources during a healthcare crisis such as a pandemic. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Efficiency and Optimization**: AI can help optimize the use of scarce resources, especially during pandemics where hospitals operate on tight margins and need to manage limited supplies effectively.\n\n2. **Complex Decision-Making**: Resource allocation during a crisis can be extremely complex and time-consuming. AI can assist in making these decisions faster and more efficiently.\n\n3. **Medical Ethics**: Ethical approaches to resource allocation already exist, and AI can be aligned with these principles.\n\nHowever, there are also significant concerns:\n\n1. **Bias**: AI algorithms can inherit biases present in historical data, potentially leading to unfair treatment of certain groups.\n\n2. **Regulatory Gaps**: There is currently a lack of regulatory oversight, which can lead to misuse and unintended consequences.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: Without sufficient testing and validation, the accuracy and reliability of AI algorithms are questionable.\n\nConsidering these points, while it is acceptable to use AI algorithms for resource allocation, it must be done with careful consideration of biases, thorough testing, and robust ethical frameworks.\n\n<answer> Yes </answer>\n\nGiven the context, the answer is nuanced but leans towards acceptance with stringent conditions.

The extent of these effects remain somewhat speculative until the precise terms of the United Kingdom's post-Brexit relationship with the EU becomes clear. With an end to British participation in the EU's policies on freedom of movement of goods, persons, services, and capital, and the European Union Customs Union, as well as sharing criminal intelligence and other matters, there is a clear impact with consequences for both institutions.\nSize and wealth\n[edit]In 2018, the UK had the fifth highest nominal GDP in the world and the second largest in the EU.[1]\nBrexit resulted in the EU experiencing a net population decrease of 13% between 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2020. Eurostat data suggests that there would otherwise have been a net increase over the same period.[2]\nBudget\n[edit]The UK's contribution to the EU budget in 2016, after accounting for its rebate, was €19.4 billion. After removing about €7 billion that the UK receives in EU subsidies, the loss to the EU budget comes to about 5% of the total. Unless the budget is reduced, Germany (already the largest net contributor) seems likely to be asked to provide the largest share of the cash, its share estimated at about €2.5 billion.[3]\nAs of March 2020[update], debate continues between those members who wish the budget to be limited to no more than 1% of members' combined GDP and those who want it to be 1.074%.[4]\nReadiness\n[edit]In response to Brexit, the European Commission issued a communication on readiness named: \"Communication on readiness at the end of the transition period between the European Union and the United Kingdom\".[5]\nPolicy changes\n[edit]The years are over when Europe cannot follow a course because the British will object. Now the British are going, Europe can find a new élan.\nThe UK was a major player in the EU which served as both an asset to the Union, but also a hindrance to those who supported a direction firmly opposed by the British government.[6]\nIdeological shift\n[edit]As the EU's third most populous state, with over 12% of the Union's population, the UK was an influential player in the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Its absence will impact the ideological balance within the EU institutions.[7]\n- Council\nIn the Council, during the UK's membership there were two blocs, each capable of forming a blocking minority against the other: the protectionist bloc of mainly southern states and the liberal bloc of mainly northern states. As a member of the latter, the UK's departure will weaken the liberal bloc as the UK has been a sizeable and fervent proponent of an economically liberal Europe, larger trade deals with third countries and of further EU enlargement. While weakening the liberal bloc, it will also strengthen Germany's individual position in the Council through the loss of a key counterweight. However, Germany remains uneasy about this role lest other member states anxious of German dominance may be more tempted to ally against it.[7][8]\n- European Parliament\nIn the European Parliament, Brexit led to changes in group representation: Brexit gave 5 seats to the EPP and 3 seats to the ID, while 29 seats were lost by the NI (including Brexit party) 11 seats lost by the Renew Europe (LibDem) 7 seats losts by the green, and six seats lost by the alliance of socialists and democrats (S&D).\nSimilarly, a majority of the UK's representatives sat with right-leaning groups, namely the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy, both of which were built around, and led by members of, the British Conservative Party and UKIP. The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats also lost its members from the UK's Labour Party, but on the whole would be left strengthened by t\nDoc 2(Title: oters heading to the Brexit Party and the urban rich drifting to the rival Liberal Democrats.) The economic consequences of Brexit will be low in the short run, and positive in the long run. The Irish border problem can be solved if there is good will between Britain and Ireland, as there must be.\nThe greatest risk in Britain today is that the British people were told that the 2016 referendum was their chance to choose the destiny of their nation. Any economic risks attached to Brexit are nothing compared to the political risk of denying the people the voice they were promised.\nThis piece originally appeared in Inside Sources\nDoc 3(Title: It was the largest exercise of democracy in Britain’s long democratic history. On June 23, 2016, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. The best single reason for the U.K. to leave the European Union at the end of October is that this is what the British people voted to do.) It’s been a long time coming. Brexit was supposed to happen at the end of March. But the deadline has been extended twice, as the House of Commons rejected every possible approach to resolving the crisis.\nThe delays are unpopular, as demonstrated by recent election results. The governing Conservative Party suffered a smashing defeat in the local elections, while the European elections delivered a stunning victory for the new Brexit Party, which has as its only goal getting Britain out of the EU.\nWhat has stopped many MPs from heeding the voters and supporting an immediate exit from the EU is fear that Britain will suffer economically if it leaves. Or, to put it more exactly, Conservative MPs are afraid that leaving the EU will damage their party’s reputation for economic competence — a reputation they see as key to defeating Jeremy Corbyn’s far-left Labour Party.\nThis fear is misplaced. EU membership is no guarantee of prosperity. Germany is prosperous, but Greece, also a member of the EU, has been immiserated. Inside or outside the EU, prosperity depends first and foremost on the wisdom of your national policies.\nFor Britain, the EU adds relatively little economic value. British exports of goods go disproportionately to the world outside the EU, so the EU’s common market is of less use to it. Unfortunately, the EU has never been able to create a truly common market in services, in which Britain dominates. And the UK imports a lot of food, which the EU makes more expensive.\nBeing in the EU means Britain gives preference to talent from Europe, a rich but small region, not talent from around the world. And the EU loves to regulate, which adds costs that Britain has to pay.\nOf course, leaving the EU immediately is not going to be all smooth sailing. Britain cannot leave a trading and regulatory area it has been part of since 1973 without some bumps. But it is the government’s job to prepare for and to minimize those bumps.\nThe fact that people are still concerned about the bumps goes to show what a bad job the British government has done in its exit negotiations with the EU. It managed to work itself into a corner by not preparing fully for exiting without a deal, while the deal it did negotiate turned out to be a bad one.\nBut Britain still has time to redeem those mistakes. After Prime Minister Theresa May’s successor is chosen, the new government will have about three months to prepare for exiting the EU without a deal. It can also use that time to restart the negotiations with the EU.\nIf those negotiations produce a genuine free trade area between the EU and the U.K., that would be ideal. But the odds of such a success are very low. The EU likes the unacceptable deal it has already negotiated and has no desire to change it. Britain must be fully prepared to walk away in October.\nThe recent elections show what will happen if Britain extends the Brexit deadline again. Political parties are realigning, with every vote now a referendum on Brexit. Both the Conservative and the Labour parties are suffering as a result: the Conservatives because their supporters want Brexit, and Labour because its supporters have no idea what it wants.\nConservative MPs should recognize that the biggest peril facing their party is failing to finish the job voters gave them in 2016. And Labour MPs should recognize that they risk a wipeout, with working-class voters heading to the Brexit Party and the urban rich drifting to the rival Liberal Democrats.\nThe economic consequences of Brexit will be low in the short run, and positive in the long run. The Irish border problem can be solved if there is good will between Britain and Ireland, as there must be.\nTh\nDoc 4(Title: llister said that English is still the most common language spoken by members of the European Parliament despite it having 24 official languages.[18]) Economic impacts\n[edit]Trade with the UK\n[edit]After Brexit, the EU becomes UK's biggest trading partner, and the UK becomes EU's third biggest trading partner after the United States and China.\nSome member states, notably Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, are more exposed to a Brexit-induced economic shock. The economy of the Republic of Ireland is particularly sensitive due to its common land border with the United Kingdom and its close agribusiness integration with Northern Ireland.[19]\nThe reintroduction of a customs border would have been economically and politically damaging to both sides,[20][21] particularly because of the risk to the Northern Ireland peace process that a physical border presents.[22] Despite protestations of good will on both sides, it was not obvious how border controls could have been avoided unless the UK has a Customs Union with the EU.[23][24] Arising from the agreements made at the Phase 1 negotiations (after the DUP intervention), any arrangements to be made to facilitate cross-border trade in Ireland will apply equally to cross-Channel trade but the details remain unclear.[25] In October 2019, the UK and EU renegotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol of the draft Brexit Withdrawal Agreement so as to keep open the border in Ireland and to have a customs border between the island of Ireland and the island of Great Britain (leaving Northern Ireland 'de facto' in the EU Customs Union in some respects).\nThe sectors across the EU that would be most hit by the UK's withdrawal are motor vehicles and parts (the UK is a large manufacturer and depends on an EU chain of supply for parts), electronics equipment and processed foods. Export of raw materials from the Ruhr valley would also be impacted.[20]\nInternal trade\n[edit]Ferry companies DFDS and CLdN have announced plans for new or additional direct services from Ireland to the mainland, avoiding anticipated delays and disruption on the traditional route via Great Britain.[26]\nFisheries\n[edit]In May 2021, France threatened to cut off electricity to the British Channel Island of Jersey in a fight over post-Brexit fishing rights.[27][28]\nPeople\n[edit]EU migration or Freedom of movement\n[edit]The impact of this would be felt most on eastern European member states who have approximately 1.2 million workers in the UK by the end of 2015; the largest groups from Poland (853,000), Romania (175,000) and Lithuania (155,000).[3] A year after the Brexit vote, net annual immigration to the UK fell by 106,000 with most attributed to EU citizens leaving for other states, with the biggest drop among those from the western European states.[29]\nThe Polish government is encouraging its young emigrant workforce to return to Poland, but due to regulatory or political reasons many would either stay in the UK or move to other western cities such as Amsterdam or Berlin.[30] Other western European member states may see much of the flow coming from eastern states in future. The influx of workers from the east would be economically beneficial to countries such as Germany, but may be politically problematic.[3]\nIn a similar manner, in October 2019 the Romanian government was encouraging Romanian workers to go home. According to an interview done with the minister of labour at that time, he was saying \"we want all Romanians to come home if possible\" and that \"the government in Bucharest has launched an advertising campaign to encourage workers home. It is putting in place a range of incentives made up of grants and loans\". Apparently at that time, 4,452 Romanians worked for the NHS while Eastern European workers accounted for 67% of seasonal workers in British agriculture.[31]\nBritish residents in the European Union have lost their European Citizen rights but otherwise are to be unaffected because of the terms of t\nDoc 5(Title: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Statement for the Record Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community) \ntariffs and may\n\ndelay ratifying the USMCA until those concerns are addressed.\n\n• US-EU trade, valued at $1.2 trillion in 2017, would almost certainly suffer disruptions from a\n\nno-deal Brexit, which would further dampen UK—and to a lesser extent EU—economic\n\ngrowth.

Ronald Schurin is an associate professor in residence political science and formerly served in the Education Division at the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, who teaches courses on American political parties, electoral realignment, and Connecticut state and municipal politics. He served as an elector for Connecticut in the Electoral College during the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election. He recently discussed the issues surrounding the Electoral College with UConn Today.\nAfter the George W. Bush win over Al Gore in 2000, there was a lot of discussion about changing the presidential election to a direct popular vote, which would require a constitutional amendment. Were there ever any serious efforts for acting on such a change?\nPrior to 2000, there had been several relatively minor incidents that had generated some discussion. For example, in 1968, there was a Republican elector in North Carolina who voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon; in 1976, a Ford elector voted for Ronald Reagan; and in 1988, a Dukakis elector voted for Lloyd Bensten for president. At the time of the 1968 vote, there was a lot of discussion in Congress when the electoral votes were counted, as to whether to allow that vote. It was allowed, but subsequently Sen. Birch Bayh [Democrat] of Indiana chaired several hearings with discussion of several options: get rid of the Electoral College, have states cast their electoral votes but in proportion to the popular vote, or just forbid the faithless elector that you saw in North Carolina. Nothing came of it.\nIs there a provision in the Electoral College process to prevent someone from voting against the way they were elected to vote by their party?\nConnecticut and several other states have a law on the books that say you must cast your vote for the person to whom you are pledged. That law is of somewhat dubious constitutionality in terms of whether the state can pass a law that deals with the action of a federal official. It’s never been put to the test. Moreover, there are no penalties spelled out in the law. In Connecticut, interestingly, you’re supposed to get $10 when you cast your vote as an elector. I guess you could not get your $10, but beyond that there is no provision.\nWe’ve now seen this situation happen twice in recent years, where the person who received the most popular votes lost because of electoral votes. What is the possibility that this kind of thing can occur on a regular basis?\nThere is a pretty good possibility. The Electoral College biases the system in favor of the Republicans now, because the Democrats tend to win in the larger states. You get electoral votes based on the number of federal representatives – the number of members of the House, plus the number of members of the Senate. The smaller states get that bonus. That helped George W. Bush, and now Donald Trump. The smaller states, who get two bonus votes because of their two senators, are more often Republican. Trump carried 30 states and Hillary carried 20. Trump thus got 20 more electors that way. That’s how Bush won, but it’s not the only way Trump won.\nCurrently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the po\nDoc 3(Title: Abstract) This paper analyzes four trends that are affecting the 2016 election: changing US demographics and the reaction to them, a growing distrust of government, increased polarization and government gridlock, and the rise of populism. It compares the views of candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald S. Trump on the Affordable Care Act, climate change, prescription drug pricing, prevention of injuries and deaths from firearms, and the opioids epidemic; and offers perspectives on the potential impact of the election not only on U.S. health care policy, but on the health of American democracy itself.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis manuscript is based on the Betty and Herb Dupont Lecture at the Americal Clinical and Climatological Association on October 22, 2016. For the lecture, I conducted an extensive evidence review, mainly through Google, on the trends influencing the 2016 election, and on the election’s potential impact on US health care policy. This manuscript describes the findings of my evidence review, interprets and analyzes them, and offers perspectives on the implications not only for US health care but also the health of American democracy. Because the lecture took place prior to the November 8 election, this paper does not specifically comment on the results of the election, although the perspectives offered on how Donald S. Trump’s positions as a candidate, compared to those of former Secretary of State Hillary R. Rodham, are relevant to any conversation about what Mr. Trump’s election and continued Republican control of Congress bodes for health care policy.\nINTRODUCTION\nHunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, which chronicled the 1972 Nixon versus McGovern campaign, was described by the New York Times as “the best account yet published” of a modern American presidential campaign (1). “What makes the story so painful, and so painfully funny” writes Matt Taibbi in his introduction to the book’s 40th anniversary edition, “is that Hunter chooses the presidential campaign, of all places, to conduct this hopeless search for truth and justice. It’s probably worse now than it was in Hunter’s day, but the American presidential campaign is the last place in the world a sane man would go in search of anything like honesty. It may be the most fake place on earth” (2).\nThe same might be said of the 2016 election; an election characterized by personal attacks, misinformation, and relentless negativity, as voters are being asked to choose between two major party candidates who most distrust and view unfavorably—a “lesser of two evils” choice to many. This isn’t the first “lesser evils” election; in Fear and Loathing, Hunter wrote, “How many more of these stinking, double-downer sideshows will we have to go through before we can get ourselves straight enough to put together some kind of national election that will give me and the at least 20 million people I tend to agree with a chance to vote FOR something, instead of always being faced with that old familiar choice between the lesser of two evils?” (1)\nYet, like the choices or not, the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or businessman Donald S. Trump will result in starkly different outcomes for America’s health care system. It’s not just health care that is at stake; it’s the health of our democratic system of government itself.\nThe anger and distrust evidenced by large swaths of the electorate today, and the poisonous atmosphere that it has introduced into the election, didn’t just suddenly arise. It came about because of four trends—reactions to changing demographics; distrust of government; partisanship and gridlock; and now, populism—that have been gathering steam for decades, only to come to a head in this election.\nCHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS\n“The U.S. electorate this year will be the country’s most racially and ethnically diverse ever.

Of the remaining 35% only 11% would have voted Trump, the rest were undecided.\n\nBut Clinton had the highest backing in the Nordic regions, with levels of support ranging from 72% in Norway to a high of 81% in Denmark, and relatively few undecided.\n\nOther European countries weren’t far behind, almost three quarters of Germans (72%) thought Clinton would make a better president, while 64% of the French agreed.\n\n![Image 1: Who would you rather was president of the USA? %  ](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/mWOx6YRlZnnwxS0ug8Dll64I0pMzSKmRu30XNNmM-Wc.JPG)\n\nImage: YouGov\n\n**Where did Trump have the most support?**\n\nThe real election result is reflected in the results of the survey, which showed the highest support for Trump in the US, at 39%, more than any other country.\n\nOne-fifth of those in Thailand and India were also in favour of a Trump presidency, but with far less support he has in America.

The outcome of today’s election is in the hands of those voters lucky enough to live in a battleground state.) But even these voters are not equal. A few of the battleground states are crucial, others less so. So which battleground states are which? And when, due to the unprecedented level of mail-in balloting, can we expect to know their outcomes?\nAt the top of the list are Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Florida alone could be the tip-off to the identity of the next president. It’s been on the winning side in 13 of the last 14 presidential elections, losing out only in the 1992 Bill Clinton-George H. W. Bush race. President Donald Trump won Florida by a mere 1 percentage point in 2016. Given that he’s behind by a larger margin in national polls this time, Trump likely has to win Florida again to have a chance of victory. Florida’s outcome could be known tonight or by early tomorrow morning. Unlike some states, Florida allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start before Election Day, and such ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted.\nWisconsin is another battleground state that’s more equal than others. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden were to carry Wisconsin, which Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016, he likely will carry the neighboring battleground states of Michigan and Minnesota. They split in 2016, with Hillary Clinton winning narrowly in Minnesota, Trump narrowly in Michigan. But, compared with Wisconsin’s voters, the voters in these two states lean more Democratic. Wisconsin is probably a must-win for Trump, but we might not know its outcome until late next week. Because of a Supreme Court ruling last week, only mail-in ballots received by Election Day will be counted in Wisconsin. Yet, its counting can’t start until Election Day and the state is not equipped to quickly tabulate large numbers of mail-in votes.\nPennsylvania has been a toss-up state in nearly every presidential election since 1976. Trump won by fewer than 50,000 votes in 2016 — this in a state where more than 6 million ballots were cast. Pennsylvania is nearly a must-win state for Biden and he’s in a stronger position there than Clinton was in 2016. Like Wisconsin, it might be late next week before we know the outcome in Pennsylvania. It has a high rate of mail-in balloting, and the count of these ballots can’t begin until Election Day. If the race in Pennsylvania is tight, a legal fight is certain. The Supreme Court declined to make a final decision on a ruling of Pennsylvania’s high court that the state could count ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 and received three days later. The late arriving ballots, for the moment, will be counted separately.\nArizona and North Carolina are in my next tier of important battleground states. Arizona is a new entry into the key battleground-state category. Once safely Republican, it has been trending Democratic due to its increasing Latino population. Unless it’s very close, Arizona’s outcome should be known early. Its mail-in votes can be counted as they arrive. If Trump were to lose Arizona, he likely would have to outperform expectations in the Rust Belt to pull off an Electoral College victory.\nFor its part, North Carolina is another state that Trump likely needs to win. It has gone Republican in four of the last five elections — the exception was 2008, when Barack Obama narrowly edged John McCain. Like Florida, North Carolina could provide an early indicator of the next president. It allows the counting of mail-in ballots to start in advance of Election Day.\nIn the lowest tier of this year’s battleground states are Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Texas. They’re what I would call the “gravy” category. If a combination of these states votes contrary to its recent history, we’re looking at either a lopsided Biden win or, if Trump wins, t\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nBased on the information provided, in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton received more popular votes than Donald Trump, but lost the Electoral College.

The “problems” with the Electoral College are well-known. Its “winner-take-all” feature supposedly distorts the electoral process, and on four occasions (1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000), it has chosen a president who received fewer popular votes than one of his opponents.\nDebates over the future of the Electoral College often assume that there are only two options: scrap the institution altogether or else accept that it will continue to operate as it has in the past. Scraping the Electoral College is usually assumed to require a constitutional amendment, although the Soros plan would actually leave the Constitution unchanged but seek to bind electors to cast their votes for the candidate with the largest national popular vote regardless of the results in their particular state.\nThere is an alternative, however, that would make the results of the Electoral College more democratic but would leave the Constitution unchanged.\nAlthough it has long been the practice that individual states award their entire electoral vote allotment to the candidate receiving the largest number of popular votes in the state, there is no constitutional requirement that states follow this approach. In the first part of the 19th century, many states split their electoral votes, and today two states, Maine and Nebraska, have abandoned the “winner take all” rule. (In 2008, Nebraska split its electoral votes between McCain and Obama.)\nIn the first third of the 19th century the selection by a single state of electors supporting different candidates was a frequent feature of American presidential elections. As late as 1824, five of 24 states did just that. In 1828, three states did so, including New York, which cast 20 votes for Andrew Jackson and 16 for the incumbent John Quincy Adams. By the mid-1830’s, every state appears to have embraced the winner take all system, although in 1860, New Jersey reverted to the older system and ended up dividing its seven electors between the Republican Abraham Lincoln (4) and the Northern Democrat Stephen Douglas (3)\nArticle II of the United States Constitution makes it clear that each state has the power to adopt a different system of choosing electors, should it choose to do so. There are at least three ways that states could chose to apportion their electors that would produce more equitable allocations of electoral votes.\nA state could simply apportion its electors on the basis of the popular vote. For example, in 2008, Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes could have divided six for Obama and four for McCain based upon Obama’s 56% to 44% margin of victory. On the other hand, such a system can run into problem because of the presence of “third” parties. Like Wisconsin, Minnesota currently has 10 electoral votes. In 2008, Obama and McCain received 54% and 44% of the popular vote, respectively, with 2% going to third parties. The Constitution requires the appointment of actual electors, so it is not obvious as to whom the tenth Minnesota elector would be assigned.\nA second possibility would be for a state legislature to divide the state into “electoral districts” with each district choosing one elector. Because each state has two more electors than it has representatives in Congress, congressional districts could not be used for this purpose. Instead, states would have to create special districts. Wisconsin, for example, would have to be divided into ten districts whose sole function would be the selection of presidential electors. Obviously, this could be done, but the process would involve many of the same difficulties that arise when the state has to redraw the lines of congressional districts.\nThe third possibility is the approach currently taken in Maine and Nebraska. The presidential candidate receiving the largest number of popu\nDoc 3(Title: won, but it’s not the only way Trump won.) Currently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the popular vote nationally. For example, in this last election a Republican elector from Ohio would have to vote for Hillary Clinton because she won the popular vote nationally. A provision of the law is that it only takes effect when states comprising 270 electoral votes – a majority – all pass it. That’s nowhere close yet. Twelve states have passed this law. Connecticut had it before the legislature three or four years ago and it did not work its way through, but there is support for it here.\nShould there be electors in some states that change their vote on Dec. 19 and go against how they are supposed to vote, and the election results change, how could that be dealt with?\nBefore the Republican convention there was a lot of discussion of delegates not voting for Donald Trump. That didn’t happen. I don’t think it’s going to happen this time. If it did, it would be the kind of issue that makes your head explode. There would be an affirmation of the popular vote but it would be people voting not according to the way the people in their state dictated that they should vote. As noted, there have been faithless electors over time, but it’s never shaped the outcome of an election. This time around it would be, as Donald Trump would say, huge.\nWe advocate to other nations as they are moving toward democracy to let the people decide their elected representatives, but the people don’t really decide here if the winner of the popular vote doesn’t win. How do we as nation reconcile that?\nMost democracies are parliamentary systems, not a three branch system such as we have. It has not been uncommon in Great Britain, for example, for one party to get more aggregate votes for its parliamentary delegation, yet the other party gets more seats. We’re not unique in that regard. Secondly, we are a federal system, and the Electoral College is one of the things that makes federalism real. If you think federalism is a good thing, then you want to keep the Electoral College. Concurrent with the existence of the Electoral College, even with several occasions when the winner of the popular vote hasn’t won the election, advocates of the present system might say that the United States emerged as the most powerful and at times richest country in history. We defeated communism and fascism, we had some great political leaders and some duds as well. The Electoral College has not destroyed American democracy.\nYou served as a Connecticut elector in 2012. What was that experience like for you?\nIt was really just one of the rituals of American democracy. One of the electors was criticized in the early days of the republic because he had been chosen to vote as a Federalist but voted for the Jeffersonians. One of his critics said, “We employed you not to think, but to act.” I acted and cast my ballot, placing it in a box that was carved out of the original Charter Oak Tree used every four years only for this purpose. The ballots were already marked for Obama and Biden. There was not much discretion there. It seemed to me it was a symbolic way of affirming the ongoing nature of the Presidency. I didn’t have to think – just to act.\nDoc 4(Title: One Person, One Vote: How Does the Electoral College Work?) \nThe Electoral College is often not a well-understood entity.

Hillary Clinton won 2.4 million more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016 election, based on the certification tally to date, but Trump won 290 Electoral College votes to Clinton’s 232, to win. The final popular election results must be officially certified by each state before electors will meet in their home states on Dec. 19 and the formal vote of the Electoral College will take place.) Ronald Schurin is an associate professor in residence political science and formerly served in the Education Division at the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, who teaches courses on American political parties, electoral realignment, and Connecticut state and municipal politics. He served as an elector for Connecticut in the Electoral College during the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election. He recently discussed the issues surrounding the Electoral College with UConn Today.\nAfter the George W. Bush win over Al Gore in 2000, there was a lot of discussion about changing the presidential election to a direct popular vote, which would require a constitutional amendment. Were there ever any serious efforts for acting on such a change?\nPrior to 2000, there had been several relatively minor incidents that had generated some discussion. For example, in 1968, there was a Republican elector in North Carolina who voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon; in 1976, a Ford elector voted for Ronald Reagan; and in 1988, a Dukakis elector voted for Lloyd Bensten for president. At the time of the 1968 vote, there was a lot of discussion in Congress when the electoral votes were counted, as to whether to allow that vote. It was allowed, but subsequently Sen. Birch Bayh [Democrat] of Indiana chaired several hearings with discussion of several options: get rid of the Electoral College, have states cast their electoral votes but in proportion to the popular vote, or just forbid the faithless elector that you saw in North Carolina. Nothing came of it.\nIs there a provision in the Electoral College process to prevent someone from voting against the way they were elected to vote by their party?\nConnecticut and several other states have a law on the books that say you must cast your vote for the person to whom you are pledged. That law is of somewhat dubious constitutionality in terms of whether the state can pass a law that deals with the action of a federal official. It’s never been put to the test. Moreover, there are no penalties spelled out in the law. In Connecticut, interestingly, you’re supposed to get $10 when you cast your vote as an elector. I guess you could not get your $10, but beyond that there is no provision.\nWe’ve now seen this situation happen twice in recent years, where the person who received the most popular votes lost because of electoral votes. What is the possibility that this kind of thing can occur on a regular basis?\nThere is a pretty good possibility. The Electoral College biases the system in favor of the Republicans now, because the Democrats tend to win in the larger states. You get electoral votes based on the number of federal representatives – the number of members of the House, plus the number of members of the Senate. The smaller states get that bonus. That helped George W. Bush, and now Donald Trump. The smaller states, who get two bonus votes because of their two senators, are more often Republican. Trump carried 30 states and Hillary carried 20. Trump thus got 20 more electors that way. That’s how Bush won, but it’s not the only way Trump won.\nCurrently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill.

For some listed species, while the major threats no longer exist today, there still are not enough members of the species to sufficiently minimize extinction risk the point where the species is no longer in danger of extinction.) What are we doing to recover endangered and threatened species?\nOnce a species is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, it becomes illegal to \"take\" that species (harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt to do these things). Similar prohibitions may also be extended to species listed as threatened under the ESA. Critical habitat must also be designated for the conservation of the species. In addition to the protections associated with their listing under the ESA, we also take the following management actions:\n- Develop and implement recovery plans for listed species where such plans would promote conservation.\n- Monitor and evaluate the status of listed species.\n- Provide grants to states and tribes for species conservation.\n- Consult on any federal government actions that may affect a listed species or its designated critical habitat to minimize possible adverse effects.\n- Enter bilateral and multilateral agreements with other nations to encourage conservation of listed species.\n- Investigate violations of the ESA.\n- Cooperate with non-federal partners to develop conservation plans, safe harbor agreements, and candidate conservation agreements with assurances for the long-term conservation of species.\n- Issue permits that authorize scientific research to learn more about listed species, or activities that enhance the propagation or survival of listed species.\n- Designate experimental populations of listed species to further the conservation and recovery of those species.\n- Issue determinations regarding the pre-listed or antique status of ESA species parts.\nWhat is a recovery plan and how does it help listed species?\nA primary role for NOAA Fisheries in recovering endangered and threatened species is to set goals for each species’ recovery comeback through the development of recovery plans. A recovery plan serves as a road map for species recovery. The plans help organize, coordinate, and prioritize recovery actions among the many management agencies, nonprofit organizations, tribal entities, stakeholders, and citizens that undertake recovery efforts. Focused implementation of actions outlined in a recovery plan also ensures effective use of resources. Recovery plans are guidance documents, not regulatory, and the Endangered Species Act clearly envisions recovery plans as the central organizing tool guiding each species’ progress toward recovery.\nHow do NOAA Fisheries partners contribute to the recovery of endangered and threatened species?\nTo recover endangered and threatened species, NOAA Fisheries needs the help of many partners. These partners provide critical resources to aid in conservation and recovery. NOAA Fisheries scientists and partners are also using innovative science to study the threats species face and determine the best methods for recovery. Partnerships include:\nStates\nUnder section 6 of the Endangered Species Act, we are authorized to enter into agreements with any state that establishes and maintains an \"adequate and active\" program for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Once a state enters into such an agreement, NOAA Fisheries is authorized to both help and fund implementation of the state's conservation program.\nStates can use federal funding—which we provide in the form of Species Recovery Grants —to support management, research, and monitoring as well as outreach projects that have direct conservation benefits for listed species, recently delisted species, and candidate species that reside within that state.\nFederal Agencies\nFederal agenci\nDoc 2(Title: ly Endangered species. Flagship species, such as gorillas, are a special kind of focal species because they capture public attention, have symbolic value, and are important for ecotourism purposes. Many flagship species and focal species are also umbrella species, because their protection indirectly benefits other species and ecosystem components with which they share their landscape (Figure 17.6.1).) Ecosystem approach\nThere is debate among conservation biologists over whether ecosystems rather than individual species should be the primary target of conservation efforts. Supporters of an ecosystem approach argue that protecting and managing ecosystems can preserve more species and provide more value to people than spending the same amount of money to protect individual species. Focusing on ecosystems also allows for greater flexibility in justifying conservation efforts, because it can be easier to demonstrate the economic value of ecosystems for helping to control floods, filtering water, and providing opportunities for recreation. To that end, the WWF has identified 238 ecoregions across the globe (the “Global 200”) that are most crucial to the biodiversity conservation (Olson et al., 2002). This Global 200 analysis formed the basis of a more recent global assessment that identified 41 at-risk ecoregions—areas of high conservation priorities because they are undergoing high levels of habitat conversion and have low protected areas coverage (Watson et al., 2016). The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) is another example of an ecosystem-focused prioritization for conservation. While the ecosystems approach overcomes several limitations of the species approach, some conservationists argue that focussing on distinct ecosystems may, in itself, be detrimental, and that the scope of conservation should be expanded, for example by also including biogeographic transition zones (van Rensburg et al., 2013).\nWilderness approach\nWilderness areas are large areas where people have had little influence on the environment (relative to other areas), they have few people living in them, and are unlikely places for human development in the short term. These areas are conservation priorities because they may be the only places where animals that require large home ranges can continue to survive in the wild. Further, wildernesses can serve as controls or benchmarks for researchers to measure the effect of human disturbance on nature. The most popular way to identify wilderness areas is to identify areas without roads. While very few roadless areas remain, many of the world’s most important roadless wildernesses, some larger than 10,000 km2, are in Africa (Ibisch et al., 2016). Of concern is that, second to South America, Africa also leads the world in wilderness losses over the past decade (Potapov et al., 2017). It is worth emphasizing that even wilderness areas have had a long history of human activity (Roberts et al., 2017). It is not always necessary or even possible to eliminate all human activity from such areas, if those activities do not obstruct conservation goals.\nHotspot approach\nMultiple prominent initiatives have prioritized conservation in areas where large concentrations of species can be protected in a relatively small area. Perhaps the most prominent example is the Global Biodiversity Hotspots initiative. Combining a species approach with an ecosystem approach, Global Biodiversity Hotspots are areas with exceptionally high levels of biological diversity and endemism—that is, irreplaceable biodiversity—that are threatened with imminent habitat destruction. Conservation International (CI) has identified an expanded set of 36 Biodiversity Hotspots (Mittermeier et al., 2005). This expanded set of Biodiversity Hotspots covers only 2.3% of Earth’s surface yet contains over 50% of all plant species and over 40% of all terrestrial vertebrate species.\nhttps://www.cepf.net/our-work/biodiversity-hotspots.\nWhile the Global Biodiversity Hotspo\nDoc 3(Title: Listing Species Under the Endangered Species Act) Before a species can receive the protection provided by the Endangered Species Act, it must first be added to the federal lists of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants.

Learn more about the process.\nHow Do Species Become Protected Under the Endangered Species Act?\nBefore a species can receive the protection provided by the Endangered Species Act (ESA), it must first be added to the federal lists of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. A species is added to this list when we determine that it has met the definition of endangered or threatened under the ESA. Species may also be removed from the list (i.e., “delisted”) when they no longer require ESA protection, or have a change in status (i.e., “reclassified”, for example, from threatened to endangered).\nUnder the ESA, a species must be listed if it is threatened or endangered because of any of the following 5 factors:\n- present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;\n- over-utilization of the species for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;\n- disease or predation;\n- inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and\n- other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.\nThe ESA requires that listing determinations be based solely on the best scientific and commercial information available; economic impacts are not considered in making species listing determinations and are prohibited under the ESA.\nThe process by which we evaluate whether a species should be added or removed from the list, or reclassified in status, is commonly referred to as the “Listing Process.” The steps of this process are described in more detail below.\nNote: once a species is listed under the ESA, NOAA Fisheries must determine whether there are areas that meet the definition of critical habitat.\nLearn more about the process of designating critical habitat\nWhat Starts the Listing Process?\nThere are two ways by which a species may come to be listed (or delisted) under the ESA:\n-\nWe receive a petition from a person or organization requesting that we list a species as threatened or endangered, reclassify a species, or delist a species (View current petitions for species).\n-\nWe voluntarily choose to examine the status of a species by initiating a status review of a species\nHow Do You Evaluate A Petition You Receive?\nThe following diagram shows the steps we take to evaluate a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species.\n90-Day Finding\nAfter receiving a petition, within 90 days (to the maximum extent practicable), we must publish a finding that states our decision whether or not to accept the petition.\nIf we find that the petition:\n- does not present substantial information that the petitioned action may be warranted, we publish what’s called a “negative 90-day finding” denying the petition in a Federal Register notice.

This scientific review involves collecting and analyzing the best available scientific and commercial information on the species, including its biology, ecology, abundance and population trends, and threats to the species, in order to evaluate the species’ current status and extinct\nDoc 4(Title: Request for Information) In October 2021, FEMA published a Request for Information (RFI) notice in the Federal Register seeking public comment on the National Flood Insurance Program’s minimum floodplain standards, and on ways to better promote conservation of threatened and endangered species, and their habitats, consistent with the Endangered Species Act.\nFEMA is now in the process of reviewing the 431 comments received in response to the RFI as part of the agency’s broader effort to improve the NFIP and protect listed species.\nThis page discusses the benefits of conserving endangered species.\nScientists estimate that between 10 and 50 million species inhabit our planet worldwide, although only approximately 1.7 million organisms have been catalogued (Why Save Endangered Species? USFWS, July 2005). All living things are part of a complex, often delicately balanced network called the biosphere, which is comprised of ecosystems. The removal of a single species can set off a chain reaction that can have devastating effects on the system as a whole.\nThere are specific benefits of conserving species and maintaining species diversity, which can be thought of as “values.” These values include three types of benefits: consumptive (e.g., harvesting, fishing, medicine), non-consumptive (e.g., wildlife viewing, ecosystem balance, ecotourism, cultural heritage), and non-use (e.g., species existence). For a more detailed account of the values associated with protecting wildlife and threatened and endangered species including medicinal, agricultural, and natural diversity values, please read the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service publication, Why Save Endangered Species?.\nAs stated in the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Congress recognizes the “aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value” of conserving endangered and threatened species. In passing the ESA in 1973, Congress codified the Government’s commitment to promoting the recovery of threatened and endangered species and the conservation of the critical habitat on which they depend. A species is considered endangered if it is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, and a species is considered threatened if it is likely to become endangered in the future (Endangered Species Act, 1973). There are approximately 1,775 species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA.\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) administer the ESA for all threatened and endangered species. NMFS generally has jurisdiction over marine species, and USFWS has jurisdiction over all other listed species. A primary goal for both USFWS and NMFS is to support species recovery. Collectively, these federal agencies are responsible for identification and listing of species as threatened or endangered; the designation of critical habitat, development of species-specific recovery plans; cooperation with state, tribal, and local governments; and consultation with other federal agencies to ensure federal activities do not jeopardize the continued existence of a species.\nWhat is critical habitat? Critical habitat refers to the specific geographic areas that contain physical and biological features essential to the conservation of an endangered or threatened species and that may require special management and protection (Endangered Species Act, 1973). Critical habitat may also include areas that are not currently occupied by the species but will be needed for its recovery.\nEndangered Species in the Floodplain\nWhat kind of threatened and endangered species live in or near the floodplain?\nFloodplains and their adjacent habitats are essential for the survival of many threatened and endangered species, ranging from sturgeon to dragonflies. The text and links below explore the stories of just a few of these species and their ties to the floodplain.\nAtlantic Salmon (Salmo salar), Gulf of Maine Population\nTh\nDoc 5(Title: Recovery of Endangered and Threatened Species) Learn how NOAA Fisheries works with partners to protect and recover endangered and threatened marine species.\nWhat is an endangered or threatened species?\nUnder the Endangered Species Act, a species is considered “endangered” if it is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A species is considered “threatened” if it is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.\nWho is responsible for protecting endangered and threatened species?\nNOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service share responsibility for implementing the Endangered Species Act, which is the primary way the federal government protects species in danger of extinction. The purpose of the act is to conserve endangered and threatened species and their ecosystems. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for endangered and threatened marine and anadromous species—from whales and seals to sharks, salmon, and corals. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for terrestrial and freshwater species, but also has responsibility over several marine species like sea otters, manatees, and polar bears. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries also share jurisdiction over several other species such as sea turtles and Atlantic salmon.\nNOAA Fisheries works with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other federal agencies, the states, tribes, and other stakeholders to recover listed species. As a nation that enjoys the benefits provided by a diverse natural environment, it is everyone’s shared responsibility to help recover endangered and threatened species.\nWhat does it mean to recover an endangered or threatened species?\nRecovery is the process of restoring endangered and threatened species to the point where they no longer require the safeguards of the Endangered Species Act.\nTo determine if an endangered or threatened species has recovered, NOAA Fisheries reviews the best available data about the species. This information is gathered from the states, members of the public, the scientific community, and various other sources. We evaluate this information against the definitions of threatened and endangered and the species’ recovery criteria, where identified, to determine if the species is still in danger of extinction or likely to become endangered in the future. Some factors that managers may consider when determining if a species is eligible for downlisting (i.e., from endangered to threatened) or delisting (i.e., removal from the list) are population increases, mechanisms to conserve a species and its habitat, and reduction of threats. Once a species is determined to be recovered, it can then be removed from the list of endangered and threatened species. NOAA Fisheries and partners monitor a delisted species status for at least five years afterward to ensure its recovery is sustained.\nWhy is it important to recover endangered and threatened marine and anadromous species?\nEach plant, animal, and their physical environment is part of a complex web of life. The extinction of a single species can affect many other species, especially humans, who depend on marine, estuarine, and riverine environments for food, commerce, medicine, and recreation. In addition to these practical benefits, the wide variety of species found in our oceans and coasts provide inspiration, beauty, and solace to many. The Endangered Species Act is a tool to help focus conservation efforts and preserve the diversity of the planet in an effort to maintain this natural legacy for future generations.\nWhat threats are preventing species recovery?\nEndangered and threatened species face many threats, including habitat destruction; the effects of pollution, disease, and competition from invasive species; a changing climate; and intense or illegal harvesting pressures. For some listed species, while the major threats no longer exist today, there still are not enough members of the species to sufficiently \n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that the preservation of endangered species is highly prioritized. The U.S. government and related organizations have established multiple laws, regulations, and programs aimed at protecting and recovering endangered species.

On another occasion, Trump spoke highly of China's President Xi being president for life and joked to great applause that maybe \"we'll give that a shot someday.\"\nThough he once claimed he'd done more in his first two years in office than any other President in US history (George Washington and Franklin Roosevelt, among others, might have something to say about that), Trump is certainly no great student of the presidency. As such, he is likely unaware of an intriguing trend among his three predecessors that may carry consequences for 2020.\nIndeed, sometimes presidential trivia can be, well, not so trivial.\nConsider this: Minus the FDR exception (he served multiple terms in office before the advent of modern-day term limits), we have now had three two-term presidents in a row: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The last time that sequence occurred was well over two centuries ago, with a trio of like-minded chief executives: Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe (1801-1825).\nIndeed, what makes the contemporary trio even more unique is that unlike their historical predecessors, who represented a kind of self-perpetuating political dynasty (they lived within 30 miles of one another, all knew each another, and hailed from the same state and political party), Clinton, Bush and Obama were wildly different as people and as presidents. Between 1996 and 2012, Americans managed to elect two Democrats and a Republican to second terms who were each distinct in style, personality, and political orientation.\nSo what does this pattern say about the presidency and our current politics -- and what, if anything, might it portend for 2020?\nThe incumbent's home-court advantage\nSome might say not much. The factors and circumstances that led to these presidents' reelections were just too varied and idiosyncratic to draw any broader conclusions. Still, with only 13 consecutive two-termers out of 44 past presidents (roughly 31%) and only five since the death of FDR, three consecutive two-termers is no small matter.\nNo matter how you cut it, three consecutive two-termers in command of the presidency demonstrate the vast power available to the modern-day incumbent. The capacity of presidents to direct that power to solve problems may be vastly overrated -- animated in the public's imagination by, for example, a president played by Harrison Ford single-handedly killing terrorists aboard Air Force One.\nStill, as Aaron Sorkin noted in his script for the 1995 movie \"The American President,\" the White House represents \"the single greatest home-court advantage in the modern world.\" This is especially true in the age of 24-hour news, where a president commands extraordinary and immediate visibility.\nCongress and the Supreme Court may go in and out of session, but the President is the Energizer Bunny of American politics -- always on and ever present. It's no coincidence that in the last 11 elections with incumbent candidates, incumbents prevailed eight times, leaving just three -- Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush -- as lonely one- or partial-termers.\nIt's easy to see why incumbents have such an advantage. As President Trump has demonstrated with frightening clarity, presidents dominate the national and media narratives; we see or hear them daily, in Trump's case often hourly. They wield the powers of government; their policy priorities and re-election campaigns are launched even before their first term begins; and that initial success not only creates an existing campaign organization and donor bases but can also drive the perception that the election is theirs to lose.\nWhat our modern-day two-term presidents can tell us\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were all reelected for vastly different reasons. What matters is that they all won second terms. It's also worth pointing out, as we lo\nDoc 3(Title: DONALD J. TRUMP, PETITIONER v. CYRUS R. VANCE, JR., IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK, ET AL., RESPONDENTS) \nthose particular privileges is not needed, may be\n\nappropriate.\n\n_Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_,\n\n558 U.S. 310 (2010)_,_ is apposite, too, in that its\n\nprotection against oppressive government reminds\n\nus that the President should not be an unpunished\n\noppressor and criminal himself.\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien has lessons not only\n\nre national injunctions (as a Court Member may\n\nhave noted), but also re the danger of letting the\n\nPresident cloak himself in invisibility and arrogance,\n\nif he insists he is above criminal proceedings.\n\nA Biblical view, seeing King David repenting\n\nafter Nathan revealed his sin to him, and the Lord\n\ntelling Ezekiel to warn people of their sins, is\n\nrelevant here.\n\nGiven the current Chief Executive’s proclivities\n\ntowards unlimited power, the current moment is a\n\nstrikingly poor time to further allow him—or all\n\nfuture Presidents—further license.\n\n4\n\nFinally, Shakespeare’s _Coriolanus_ illustrates the\n\nevil and chaos that happen when leaders betray\n\ntheir country’s best interests, and lack of legal\n\nprocess to try those leaders properly makes things\n\neven worse. The Court should take heed.\n\n**ARGUMENT**\n\n**I. NOTES ON CHANGE IN AMICUS PRACTICE:**\n\n**OR, THE SOFT STATISM OF REDUCING**\n\n**AMICUS BRIEFS TO 8000 WORDS**\n\nFirst off, a quick procedural comment or two:\n\nAmicus notes he has had, “for whatever reason”, a\n\nhiatus of some years since writing the Court. He also\n\nnotes that mysteriously, the rules have changed so\n\nthat the average amicus or amica—one who is not\n\npart of a state entity—is now limited to 8000 words,\n\ninstead of the 9000 he/she used to have. Amicus\n\nwonders if this new rationing of core legal and/or\n\npolitical (since law and politics overlap) speech is a\n\ngood idea.\n\n_Inter alia_, state entities, being large, established,\n\nand powerful, have plenty of ways of making\n\nthemselves heard. By contrast, it is, say, the small-\n\ntime country lawyer, writing her first and only brief\n\nto this Court, who may need all 9000 words to make\n\nimportant and complicated arguments to the Court.\n\nMaybe the government amici, not the “little people”,\n\nso to speak, should have been restricted to 8000\n\nwords, Thus, there is arguably a sort of statism, even\n\nif soft statism, in the new 8000-word wall. Perhaps\n\nthe Court can revisit its unnecessary speech-\n\nrationing at some point.\n\n5\n\n(Amicus is not “resentful” of the 8000-word limit;\n\nif he were, then, like Achilles sulking in his tent,\n\nHomer, _The Iliad_, he might have refused even to\n\nwrite this brief, or any amicus brief. But sulking\n\nmay achieve little, so here is Amicus, with his brief.)\n\n…True, some amici may be able to shoehorn their\n\nentire brief into, say, the length of a 17-syllable\n\n_haiku_. This is not always going to happen, though.\n\nEnough on that point for now: speaking of\n\nstatism, far more important forms of statism exist to\n\nbe criticized here, such as the deep state of\n\ncorruption created at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if\n\nthe President is deemed immune to criminal\n\nproceedings during his tenure in office.\n\n**II. NONACCOUNTABILITY FOR CRIMES**\n\n**MAKES THE PRESIDENT A ONE-MAN “DEEP**\n\n**STATE”, WHICH IS UN-AMERICAN**\n\nA theme or “meme” of recent decades, a “urban\n\nlegend” of sorts, has been the ““Deep State””, a\n\npossibly-legendary bunch of sneaky, shadowy D.C.\n\nbureaucrats running everything in secret. Whether\n\nthis umbrageous gang exists or not, what would be\n\neven worse, maybe, is if in open view, one member of\n\nour society is made into a temporary god, or idol, free\n\nfrom criminal investigation or prosecution. Such a\n\nparagon of lawlessness, a perfidious President\n\nbeyond his own society’s limitations, a Nietzschean\n\n“Superman” of sorts—“beyond good and evil”, at\n\nleast in his own troubled mind—, would be a one-\n\nperson “Deep State” incarnate: dark, untouchable,\n\nun-America\nDoc 4(Title: DONALD J. TRUMP, PETITIONER v. CYRUS R. VANCE, JR., IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK, ET AL., RESPONDENTS) \nent, regardless of party or other identity, is\n\nnot entitled to be above criminal process. At a time\n\nwhen the governments in China and Iran are under\n\nfire for secrecy about the deadly coronavirus\n\nravaging their countries, it is very inopportune to\n\nargue that any President here, or elsewhere in the\n\nworld, should be free to avoid transparency and\n\ninvestigation when he is behaving criminally. —Or,\n\notherwise put: especially when there is an ultra-\n\nvirus ravaging the world, the President should be\n\nheld criminally accountable when he is acting _ultra_\n\n_vires_.)\n\n…Briefly, while we are on the note of _Star Wars_:\n\nthat series, _see id._, is largely about an evil emperor\n\nwho has contempt for the people, but is eventually\n\noverborne by the force of their righteous power. In\n\nreal life, the democratic force of “We the People” is\n\ndeposited, in part, in the President, he being a\n\nconduit, a presider, and a potential target of the\n\nlaws, as discussed earlier. If any President mistakes\n\nhimself for the actual force itself, sees himself as\n\nbeing the law, or being above the law, rather than\n\nseeing himself as a temporary wielder of the force for\n\nthe good of the People who provide the force to\n\n29\n\ngovernment, this would not be American. The force\n\nis not he, and would not truly be with him if he\n\nplaced himself above the People. The force is\n\neventually from and with the People, U.S. Const.\n\npmbl.; and if the Court recognizes that, it should not\n\nlet a criminal President be immune to the force of\n\nthe People’s justice, since free societies properly\n\nhonor the People above their hired servant the State.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n“If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.”\n\nThat tough Trumanesque truism deserves to be\n\nrepeated near-endlessly, when one discusses\n\nwhether to make the President free from criminal\n\ninquiry or interment. (If the sequelae of criminal\n\nacts distract the criminal: don’t commit criminal acts\n\nin the first place! or, leave the kitchen if the heat is\n\ntoo great.) After all, it is a sort of treason for the\n\nPresident to be committing crimes in the first\n\nplace—when he is supposed to be the First Role\n\nModel for Americans—, or for him even to want to\n\ndisrespect the American people by putting himself\n\nabove investigation of his possible crimes.\n\nOn that note: _The Tragedy of Coriolanus_ tells the\n\nstory of one poignantly tragic traitor, the noble\n\nRoman called Caius Martius Coriolanus. As\n\nShakespeare relates, Coriolanus, _see id._, fights\n\nfiercely for Rome, but loses his political position\n\nbecause of his arrogance; then defects to the\n\nVolscians of Corioles and leads them against Rome,\n\nand finally turns and betrays the Volscians. (If\n\nreaders want to see parallels in any current\n\nAmerican leaders allegedly kowtowing to foreign\n\npowers and hurting the Nation, readers are free to\n\n30\n\ndo so. …And should criminal treasonous, or quasi-\n\ntreasonous, acts really be beyond punishment if you\n\nare President?)\n\nCoriolanus awaits punishment in Corioles, an\n\nangry crowd nearby and in lynching mood; but a lord\n\nof the Volscians says, “His last offenses to us/Shall\n\nhave judicious \\[judicial\\] hearing.” _Id._, act 5, sc. 6.\n\nUnfortunately, Coriolanus then starts viciously\n\ninsulting other Volscians, who ragefully kill him, _id._\n\nHe should probably have settled for the “judicious\n\nhearing.”\n\nBut the _right_ to a judicial or legislative hearing,\n\nor investigation, can also be seen as a _duty_ for the\n\naccused to submit to the legal process. Coriolanus\n\ndied by mob lawlessness because he would not take\n\nthe lifeline the law offered him; but a President who\n\nrefuses to submit to the State’s judgment, who\n\nclaims he is above criminal investigation/\n\nprosecution (and who does not need a lifeline,\n\nbecause he will not be assassinated like a Coriolanus\n\nif he refuses to submit to governm\nDoc 5(Title: won, but it’s not the only way Trump won.) Currently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the popular vote nationally. For example, in this last election a Republican elector from Ohio would have to vote for Hillary Clinton because she won the popular vote nationally. A provision of the law is that it only takes effect when states comprising 270 electoral votes – a majority – all pass it. That’s nowhere close yet. Twelve states have passed this law. Connecticut had it before the legislature three or four years ago and it did not work its way through, but there is support for it here.\nShould there be electors in some states that change their vote on Dec. 19 and go against how they are supposed to vote, and the election results change, how could that be dealt with?\nBefore the Republican convention there was a lot of discussion of delegates not voting for Donald Trump. That didn’t happen. I don’t think it’s going to happen this time. If it did, it would be the kind of issue that makes your head explode. There would be an affirmation of the popular vote but it would be people voting not according to the way the people in their state dictated that they should vote. As noted, there have been faithless electors over time, but it’s never shaped the outcome of an election. This time around it would be, as Donald Trump would say, huge.\nWe advocate to other nations as they are moving toward democracy to let the people decide their elected representatives, but the people don’t really decide here if the winner of the popular vote doesn’t win. How do we as nation reconcile that?\nMost democracies are parliamentary systems, not a three branch system such as we have. It has not been uncommon in Great Britain, for example, for one party to get more aggregate votes for its parliamentary delegation, yet the other party gets more seats. We’re not unique in that regard. Secondly, we are a federal system, and the Electoral College is one of the things that makes federalism real. If you think federalism is a good thing, then you want to keep the Electoral College. Concurrent with the existence of the Electoral College, even with several occasions when the winner of the popular vote hasn’t won the election, advocates of the present system might say that the United States emerged as the most powerful and at times richest country in history. We defeated communism and fascism, we had some great political leaders and some duds as well. The Electoral College has not destroyed American democracy.\nYou served as a Connecticut elector in 2012. What was that experience like for you?\nIt was really just one of the rituals of American democracy. One of the electors was criticized in the early days of the republic because he had been chosen to vote as a Federalist but voted for the Jeffersonians. One of his critics said, “We employed you not to think, but to act.” I acted and cast my ballot, placing it in a box that was carved out of the original Charter Oak Tree used every four years only for this purpose. The ballots were already marked for Obama and Biden. There was not much discretion there. It seemed to me it was a symbolic way of affirming the ongoing nature of the Presidency. I didn’t have to think – just to act.\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, there isn't a clear indication that Pence had a major role in Trump's presidency.

Section 4 of the 25th Amendment had not been invoked before.[25][26] The 25th Amendment, however, was initially created for the case where the president was incapacitated.\nPence, who would have been required to initiate assuming the president's powers and duties, stated that he would not invoke the 25th Amendment against Trump.[27]\nImpeachment and conviction\nImpeachment begins in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drawn up. These articles are then voted on by House members. Each article is voted on separately and requires a simple majority to pass. Once an article has been passed in the House, the president has been impeached. The articles are then sent to the Senate for adjudication with an impeachment trial. After views have been laid out in the trial, the Senate moves to vote on conviction. Each article requires a two-thirds majority of Senators present to pass. If an article passes in the Senate, the president has been convicted and is removed from office. Once the president is convicted, a further vote may then be held which determines whether the (now-former) president is barred from holding future office; this vote passes with a simple majority in the Senate.[28][29]\nBecause the Senate was not scheduled to reconvene until January 19, 2021,[30] members of Congress discussed holding the trial after Trump had left office. A former president had never been tried by the Senate; however, Secretary of War William W. Belknap had been impeached by the House and tried by the Senate after he had resigned.[4]\nInvoking the 25th Amendment\nOn the evening of January 6, CBS News reported that Cabinet members were discussing invoking the 25th Amendment.[31] The ten Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by U.S. Representative David Cicilline, sent a letter to Pence to \"emphatically urge\" him to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\", claiming that he incited and condoned the riots.[32][33] For invocation, Pence and at least eight Cabinet members, forming a simple majority, would have to consent. Additionally, if challenged by Trump, the second invocation would maintain Pence as acting president, subject to a vote of approval in both houses of Congress, with a two-thirds supermajority necessary in each chamber to sustain. However, Congress would not have needed to act before January 20 for Pence to remain acting president until Biden was inaugurated, per the timeline described in Section 4.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D–MA) accused Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in a tweet of quitting rather than supporting efforts to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump.[34] A Trump administration official disputed Warren's claim.[34] House majority whip Jim Clyburn on Friday accused DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao of \"running away from their responsibility\" by resigning from President Trump's Cabinet before invoking the 25th Amendment to strip him of his powers a\nDoc 4(Title: stration Policy supporting H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act, which The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposes.) On May 4, Trump signed an executive order that he claimed overturned the Johnson Amendment (though it did not), which precludes tax-exempt organizations, including places of worship, from engaging in any political campaign activity and would curtail the contraception mandate of the Affordable Care Act.\nOn May 10, Sessions announced in a two-page memo that DOJ was abandoning its Smart on Crime initiative that had been hailed as a positive step forward in rehabilitating drug users and reducing the enormous costs of warehousing inmates.\nOn May 11, Trump signed an executive order creating the so-called Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has a history of trying to suppress the vote in Kansas.\nOn May 23, Trump released his fiscal year 2018 budget that included massive, unnecessary tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations, which would be paid for by slashing basic living standards for the most vulnerable and by attacking critical programs like Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicaid, food assistance, and more.\nOn May 23, Trump’s fiscal year 2018 budget proposed eliminating the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) and transferring its functions to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). This would have impeded the work of both the OFCCP and the EEOC as each have distinct missions and expertise, and would have thereby undermined the civil rights protections that employers and workers have relied on for almost 50 years.\nOn June 5, Trump released an infrastructure plan that focuses on putting public assets into private hands, creating another giveaway to wealthy corporations and millionaires at the expense of working families and communities.\nOn June 6, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued unclear new instructions on transgender student discrimination.\nOn June 8, OCR’s acting head sent a memo to OCR staff discouraging systemic investigations in favor of individual investigations of discrimination.\nOn June 14, DeVos decided to delay implementation of and to renegotiate the Borrower Defense to Repayment and Gainful Employment regulations – important regulations that had been designed to protect students from predatory conduct by for-profit schools.\nOn June 14, the Department of Education withdrew, without explanation, a 2016 finding that an Ohio school district discriminated against a transgender girl.\nOn June 15, the administration rescinded President Obama’s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program, an initiative that – had it gone into effect – would have offered a pathway to citizenship for immigrant parents with children who are citizens or residents of the United States.\nOn June 27, Labor Secretary Acosta requested information on the Obama-era overtime rule, signaling his intent to lower the salary threshold of the overtime rule.\nOn June 27, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy supporting H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposes.\nOn June 27, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy supporting H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, which The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposes.\nOn June 28, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division sent a letter to 44 states demanding extensive information on how they maintain their voter rolls. This request was made on the same day that President Trump’s so-called Commission on Election Integrity sent letters to all 50 states demanding intrusive and highly sensitive personal data about all registered voters.\nOn July 24, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy supporting H.J.

To learn more about millennials’ parenting styles, we surveyed 1,000 millennial parents across the U.S. As of 2024, millennials range in age from 28-43. We found many millennials are taking a different parenting path than their parents did, seeking advice from the internet, juggling work and family obligations, and navigating conversations around mental health.\nKey Findings:\n- 73% millennial parents believe their parenting style is better than past generations\n- 3 in 4 millennial parents practice gentle parenting\n- Nearly half (46%) of millennial parents feel burned out\n- Navigating a digital world: 85% believe social media creates unrealistic parenting expectations and 1 in 4 don’t double check parenting advice from social media\n- 80% believe discussions with children around mental health are very important\n- Work-life balance: 82% of millennial parents work and 4 in 5 prioritize children over careers\nNavigating Generational Parenting Styles\nMillennial parents are doing things differently. Nearly 9 in 10 (88%) say their parenting style is different from how they were raised, and 3 in 4 (73%) believe they are better parents than their parents. With that in mind, 1 in 3 say their family members question their parenting methods.\n\"Gentle parenting should not be confused with permissiveness and accommodation of behavior,” says Miller Shivers, PhD, pediatric psychologist in The Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Lurie Children’s. “Children need limits and a certain amount of structure to best function. I worry that the emphasis on gentle parenting leads parents to believe that they have to be ok with all kinds of negative behavior from their children and that they cannot set limits and have consequences.”\nNearly 3 in 4 (74%) millennial parents practice gentle parenting which is characterized by helping guide children through the decision-making process and not threatening or punishing them. Gentle parenting focuses on a partnership between parents and children with an emphasis on communication, empathy, respect, and boundaries.\nTop 3 ways millennial parenting styles are different from past generations:\n- More open communication\n- Greater emphasis on emotional intelligence\n- More flexible parenting styles\nThe Impact of Technology and Social Media on Millennial Parenting\nParenting in the 21st Century brings additional challenges previous generations did not face, especially when it comes to technology and social media. Nearly half (46%) of millennial parents feel burned out with 85% believing social media creates unrealistic parenting expectations.\nFurther demonstrating the challenges technology can pose, 30% of millennial moms say they compare their parenting success to others on social media.\nThe top places millennials report getting parenting advice include:\n- Family\n- Talking to other parents\n- Friends\n- Books\n- Social Media\nAmong parents, 24% have received parenting advice from a social media influencer, but 1 in 4 admit to not double-checking the advice they get from social media.\n“Parenting suggestions on social media don’t take into account the individual child and what is contributing to the issue, and anyone can give advice on social media without any real expertise,” explains Dr. Shivers. “Therefore, it can foster unrealistic expectations for parents that managing behavior and difficult issues is easily solved with a small snippet of advice.”\nNavigating Mental Health Conversations and Raising Emotionally Intelligent Children\nMillennial parents are trying to put more emphasis on mental health and talking about it with their children. Among them, 47% have a child that experiences anxiety and 12% currently have a child in therapy. Among parents with children in therapy, 1 in 5 hesitate to \nDoc 2(Title: S.Hrg. 107-1050 — HUMAN CLONING) \n27;&#x27; But to secure that right and \nto achieve the requisite quality control over new human life, human \nconception and gestation will need to be brought fully into the bright \nlight of the laboratory, beneath which the child-to-be can be \nfertilized, nourished, pruned, weeded, watched, inspected, prodded, \npinched, cajoled, injected, tested, rated, graded, approved, stamped, \nwrapped, sealed, and delivered. There is no other way to produce the \nperfect baby.\n    If you think that such scenarios require outside coercion or \ngovernmental tyranny you are mistaken. Once it becomes possible, with \nthe aid of human genomics, to produce or select for what some regard as \n\\`\\`better babies&#x27;&#x27;--smarter, prettier, healthier, or more athletic--\nparents will leap at the opportunity to \\`\\`improve&#x27;&#x27; their offspring. \nNot to do so will be socially regarded as a form of child neglect. \nThose who would ordinarily be opposed to such tinkering will be under \nenormous pressure to compete on behalf of their as yet unborn \nchildren--just as they scheme almost from birth on how to get their \nchildren into Harvard. Never mind that, lacking a standard of \\`\\`good&#x27;&#x27; \nor \\`\\`better,&#x27;&#x27; no one can really know whether any such changes will \ntruly be improvements. Once the genetic genies put the babies into the \nbottle, there will be no way to get them out.\n    Proponents of cloning urge us to forget about the science fiction \nscenarios of laboratory manufacture or multiple-copied clones and to \nfocus only on the sympathetic cases of infertile couples exercising \ntheir reproductive rights. But why, if the single cases are so \ninnocent, should multiplying their performance be so off-putting? \n(Similarly, why do others object to people&#x27;s making money from that \npractice if the practice itself is perfectly acceptable?) The so-called \nscience fiction cases--like Brave New World--make vivid the meaning of \nwhat looks to us, mistakenly, to be benign. They reveal how what looks \nlike compassionate humanitarianism is, in the end, crushing \ndehumanization.\n                        toward an effective ban\n    Whether or not they share my reasons, most people today share my \nconclusion: human cloning is unethical in itself and dangerous in its \nlikely consequences, including the precedent it will establish for \ndesigning our children. Some reach this conclusion for their own good \nreasons, different from my own: concerns about distributive justice in \naccess to eugenic cloning; worries about the genetic effects of asexual \n\\`\\`inbreeding&#x27;&#x27;; aversion to the implicit premise of genetic \ndeterminism; objections to the embryonic and fetal wastage that must \nnecessarily accompany the efforts; religious opposition to \\`\\`man \nplaying God.&#x27;&#x27; Never mind why: the overwhelming majority of our fellow \nAmericans remain firmly opposed to cloning human beings. For us, the \nreal questions are: What should we do about it? How can we best \nsucceed? These questions should concern everyone eager to secure \ndeliberate human control over the powers that could redesign our \nhumanity, even if cloning is not the place they would choose to make \ntheir stand.\n    What we should do is to work to prevent human cloning by making it \nillegal. We should aim for a global legal ban if possible and a \nunilateral national ban at a minimum--and soon, before the fact is upon \nus. To be sure, legal bans can be violated; but we do curtail much \nmischief by outlawing incest, voluntary servitude, and the buying and \nselling of organs and babies. To be sure, renegade scientists may \nsecretly undertake to violate such a law, but we can deter them both by \ncriminal sanctions and monetary penalties, as well as by removing any \nincentive they have to proudly claim credit for their technological \nbravado.

Among them, 47% have a child that experiences anxiety and 12% currently have a child in therapy. Among parents with children in therapy, 1 in 5 hesitate to tell others for fear of judgment.\nDespite this, 80% think discussions about mental health and emotional well-being are very important in shaping a child’s overall development. There’s a stark contrast between the generations and discussing mental health: 2 in 3 millennial parents say their parents never talked with them about mental health while 98% of millennial parents talk with their children about it.\n“Discussing emotions is a healthy part of development for children but it can be intimidating and uncomfortable for parents who are unaccustomed to discussing such things,” says Dr. Shivers. “There is a fine line between having an open discussion and parents trying to fix things for their child. Often children just want a place to say what is on their mind, so parents should be cautious about jumping in with solutions. Supporting children as they struggle is part of healthy development (albeit it, hard for parents) and swooping in to solve their problems does not prepare them for the future or enable them to learn their own problem-solving abilities.”\nWhile 80% of millennial parents believe they set a good example for their children in dealing with stress and supporting mental health, they admit it isn’t easy. The top challenges millennial parents experience in talking with their kids about mental health include difficulty finding the right words, struggling to determine if a child understands, and fear of making things worse.\nMore than 4 in 5 (82%) millennial parents work. Among them, 58% say it’s hard to balance their work and home life. Millennial moms feel this slightly more with 63% facing challenges between work and home life, while 55% of dads struggle with the balance. The majority (4 in 5) prioritize their children over their careers, especially moms (81% vs. 78% dads).\nThe biggest challenges millennial parents face include dealing with stress, finances, raising children in a digital age, parental guilt, and balancing work and family life. Despite the challenges, 77% of millennials believe they're more present with their children than their parents were.\nNavigating parenthood in 2024 isn’t an easy feat. As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child, and parents don’t have to go through this process alone. There’s no perfect playbook for parenting, but each generation is figuring out the way that works best for them and their families.\nMethodology\nIn December 2023, we conducted a survey of 1,000 millennial parents (ages 27-42) from across the U.S. about their parenting experience. Among respondents, 50% identified as male, 49% as female, and 1% as non-binary with an average age of 35.\nFor media inquiries, contact media@digitalthirdcoast.net\nFair Use\nWhen using this data and research, please attribute by linking to this study and citing Lurie Children’s.\nSign up for our Newsletter\nGet health tips from our pediatric experts, news about ground-breaking research, and feel-good moments delivered right to your inbox.\nAdditional Blog Posts\nReturning to School After a Diabetes Diagnosis\nReturning a child to school after a diabetes diagnosis is a big transition.

This means that our children are not our children: They \nare not our property, they are not our possessions. Neither are they \nsupposed to live our lives for us, nor anyone else&#x27;s life but their \nown. Their genetic distinctiveness and independence are the natural \nforeshadowing of the deep truth that they have their own and never-\nbefore-enacted life to live. Though sprung from a past, they take an \nuncharted course into the future.\n    Much mischief is already done by parents who try to live \nvicariously through their children. Children are sometimes compelled to \nfulfill the broken dreams of unhappy parents. But whereas most parents \nnormally have hopes for their children, cloning parents will have \nexpectations. In cloning, such overbearing parents will have taken at \nthe start a decisive step that contradicts the entire meaning of the \nopen and forward-looking nature of parent-child relations. The child is \ngiven a genotype that has already lived, with full expectation that \nthis blueprint of a past life ought to be controlling of the life that \nis to come. A wanted child now means a child who exists precisely to \nfulfill parental wants. Like all the more precise eugenic manipulations \nthat will follow in its wake, cloning is thus inherently despotic, for \nit seeks to make one&#x27;s children after one&#x27;s own image (or an image of \none&#x27;s choosing) and their future according to one&#x27;s will.\n    Lest you think me hyperbolic, consider concretely the new realities \nof responsibility and guilt in the households of the cloned. No longer \nonly the sins but also the genetic choices of the parents will be \nvisited on the children--and beyond the third and fourth generation--\nand everyone will know who is responsible. No parent will be able to \nblame nature or the lottery of sex for an unhappy adolescent&#x27;s big \nnose, dull wit, musical ineptitude, nervous disposition, or anything \nelse that he hates about himself. Fairly or not, children will hold \ntheir cloners responsible for everything, for nature as well as \nnurture. And parents, especially the better ones, will be limitlessly \nliable to guilt. Only the truly despotic souls will sleep the sleep of \nthe innocent.\n    The arguments against cloning I have just presented I have \nprepared, necessarily, for adults, addressing my readers as fellow \ncitizens faced with a momentous policy decision: shall we permit our \nneighbors to clone and be cloned? As I indicated when I began, I know \nthat such moral and philosophical arguments may not be equal to the \ntask. So let me put them to you again in a nutshell, asking you to \nthink this time about cloning as if you were not a person being cloned \nbut the younger duplicated copy. Even if you were a healthy clone, \nwould you want to be constantly compared with the adult original in \nwhose image you have been made? Wouldn&#x27;t you want to have your own \nunique identity and an open-ended future, fully a surprise to yourself \nand the world? Are you happy being the copy of Mom, even though she \ndrives you crazy? Are you pleased that everyone expects you to play \nchess just because you were cloned from Bobby Fisher? Don&#x27;t you think \nthat it is a form of child abuse for parents to attempt to determine in \nadvance just exactly what kind of a child you are supposed to be? Do \nyou want to live under the tyranny of their biologically determined \nexpectations? Knowing what you know, would you like to turn human \nprocreation into manufacture, producing children as artifacts?\n                         answering the critics\n    The defenders of cloning, of course, are not wittingly friends of \ndespotism. Indeed, deaf to most other considerations, they regard \nthemselves mainly as frie\nDoc 5(Title: -- and both of you have written about that period, in which there was a great gap between rich and poor and we were ignoring lots of kids, especially lots of immigrant kids. And America seemed to be going to hell in a hand basket. And there was a dominant philosophy, social Darwinism, which said that it’s better for everybody if everybody is selfish, and the devil take the hindmost.) But that, unlike some of the ideology of Ayn Rand that you referred to -- but that period was quickly -- not quickly -- but was overcome by a real awakening of the conscience of America across party lines, with the important contribution of religious leaders and religious people, to the fact that these are all our kids.\nAnd now is not the time to rehearse all of the lessons of that earlier period, but I think it does actually give me grounds for hope. This is a kind of problem that we could solve as long as we all recognize that it’s in everybody’s interest to raise up these poor kids and not to leave them in the dust.\nMR. DIONNE: Thank you very much. By the way, let the record show the President was not looking at Arthur when he referred to cold-hearted capitalists. (Laughter.) But it is nice to have somebody here from the AEI.\nMR. BROOKS: Well, D.J., when the President said that, I was just thinking -- what was going through my head was, please don’t look at me, please don’t look at me. (Laughter.) But you notice when Bob said this -- about the social Darwinism, he pointed at me. (Laughter.) So I'm more outnumbered than my Thanksgiving table in Seattle, let me tell you. (Laughter.)\nMR. DIONNE: You just have to look into your heart, Arthur. And in fact, that’s kind of what I want to ask you to do here. I mean, your views on these subjects have actually changed, and I think it's one of the reasons you wanted to join us today.\nBack in 2010, you talked about makers and takers in society and a culture of redistribution. But in February 2014, you wrote a very important article and commentary -- the open-handed toward your brothers -- and you said we have to declare peace on the safety net, which I think is a really important thing to say.\nAnd as the President suggested, the safety net we have has actually cut poverty substantially. So twin questions: Could you talk about how and why your own views have changed -- if I’ve fairly characterized that. And in the spirit we’re celebrating here of trans-ideological nonpartisanship -- now, there’s a mouthful for you -- in that spirit, where can Republicans cooperate with Democrats, conservatives with liberals, on safety net issues like making the earned income tax credit permanent or expanding the child tax credit? I mean, where can we find not just verbal common ground, but actual common ground to get things done for the least among us?\nMR. BROOKS: Thank you, E.J. And thank you, Mr. President. It's an honor to be here and with all of you. This is such an important exercise in bringing Catholics and evangelicals together, but having a public discussion.\nOne of the main things that I do as President of AEI is to talk publicly about issues and start a conversation with my colleagues in a way that I hope can stimulate the conversation and spread it around the country.\nAt the American Enterprise Institute -- where we have a longstanding history of work on the nature of American capitalism -- when we’re focusing very deeply on poverty, it sends a signal to a lot of people that are deeply involved in the free enterprise movement. My colleague, Robert Doar is here -- he came to AEI because poverty is the most important thing to him. And indeed, the reason I came into the free enterprise movement many years ago is because poverty is the thing I care about the most.\nAnd in point of fact, 2 billion people around the world have been lifted up out of poverty because of ideas revolving around free enterprise and free trade, and the globalization of ideas of sharing through property rights and rule of law, and all the thing\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that the coming generation, particularly millennials, will have a parenting style that emphasizes open communication, emotional intelligence, and a gentle approach to discipline.

Currently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the popular vote nationally. For example, in this last election a Republican elector from Ohio would have to vote for Hillary Clinton because she won the popular vote nationally. A provision of the law is that it only takes effect when states comprising 270 electoral votes – a majority – all pass it. That’s nowhere close yet. Twelve states have passed this law. Connecticut had it before the legislature three or four years ago and it did not work its way through, but there is support for it here.\nShould there be electors in some states that change their vote on Dec. 19 and go against how they are supposed to vote, and the election results change, how could that be dealt with?\nBefore the Republican convention there was a lot of discussion of delegates not voting for Donald Trump. That didn’t happen. I don’t think it’s going to happen this time. If it did, it would be the kind of issue that makes your head explode. There would be an affirmation of the popular vote but it would be people voting not according to the way the people in their state dictated that they should vote. As noted, there have been faithless electors over time, but it’s never shaped the outcome of an election. This time around it would be, as Donald Trump would say, huge.\nWe advocate to other nations as they are moving toward democracy to let the people decide their elected representatives, but the people don’t really decide here if the winner of the popular vote doesn’t win. How do we as nation reconcile that?\nMost democracies are parliamentary systems, not a three branch system such as we have. It has not been uncommon in Great Britain, for example, for one party to get more aggregate votes for its parliamentary delegation, yet the other party gets more seats. We’re not unique in that regard. Secondly, we are a federal system, and the Electoral College is one of the things that makes federalism real. If you think federalism is a good thing, then you want to keep the Electoral College. Concurrent with the existence of the Electoral College, even with several occasions when the winner of the popular vote hasn’t won the election, advocates of the present system might say that the United States emerged as the most powerful and at times richest country in history. We defeated communism and fascism, we had some great political leaders and some duds as well. The Electoral College has not destroyed American democracy.\nYou served as a Connecticut elector in 2012. What was that experience like for you?\nIt was really just one of the rituals of American democracy. One of the electors was criticized in the early days of the republic because he had been chosen to vote as a Federalist but voted for the Jeffersonians. One of his critics said, “We employed you not to think, but to act.” I acted and cast my ballot, placing it in a box that was carved out of the original Charter Oak Tree used every four years only for this purpose. The ballots were already marked for Obama and Biden. There was not much discretion there. It seemed to me it was a symbolic way of affirming the ongoing nature of the Presidency. I didn’t have to think – just to act.\nDoc 2(Title: onvened and ultimately certified the electoral votes in the early morning hours of January 7. Trump then released a statement asserting that there would be an \"orderly transition\" of power on Inauguration Day, even while continuing to claim falsely that the election was stolen from him and also stating that he would not attend Biden's inauguration.[18]) Considered scenarios\nFour scenarios for the removal of Trump from office had been posited by members of Congress, members of Trump's cabinet, political commentators, or legal scholars: resignation, the invocation of the 14th Amendment, invocation of the 25th Amendment, or impeachment and conviction.\nResignation\nThe President of the United States can resign from office, in which case the Vice President will automatically become president, instead of merely assuming the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president. While Article II of the Constitution states that the \"Powers and Duties\" of the president devolve to the vice president in the event of the president's death, resignation, incapacity, or removal, John Tyler, the tenth president of the United States, interpreted that provision as allowing the Vice President to ascend to the presidency in such cases, without any qualifications. This practice was codified in 1967, with the passage of the 25th Amendment.\nIf Trump had resigned, Vice President Mike Pence would have become the 46th president of the United States; Pence would have been the shortest-serving president ever, being in office for a matter of days before handing power to Joe Biden as the 47th president on January 20. This would have surpassed the record of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days into his term. It would have been the second time in history that a president had been forced to resign; the first was the 1974 resignation of Richard Nixon when it appeared inevitable that he would be impeached and removed from office for his role in the Watergate scandal.\nDue to intense pressure on his administration, the threat of removal, and numerous resignations, Trump committed to an orderly transition of power in a televised speech on January 7.[19] In the White House on January 8, Trump mentioned that he was not considering resignation.[20] On January 9, The New York Times reported that Trump told White House aides that he regretted his statement committing to an orderly transition of power and that there was no chance he would resign from office.[21]\n14th Amendment\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is one of the Reconstruction Amendments. It addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law, and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. Section 3 states that a person who participated in insurrection after having taken an oath to support the Constitution is disqualified from holding future office unless permitted by Congress.\nIf Trump had been removed from office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, Pence would have become the 46th president of the United States, and he would still have been the shortest-serving president ever before handing power to Biden as the 47th president on January 20. It would also have been the first time that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment had been invoked since 1919 when it stopped Victor L. Berger, convicted of violating the Espionage Act for his anti-militarist views, from taking his seat in the House of Representatives.[22] It would also have been the first time that it had been invoked on a sitting president and its being invoked had been seen as especially unlikely.[23]\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the House Democrats who supported invoking the 14th Amendment against Trump. In a letter, Pelosi thanked her colleagues for their contributions to discussions on the 14th Amendment.[24] If successful, the former president would be ineligible for appointment to any federal office without a Senate supermajority vote in favor.\n25th \nDoc 3(Title: The 2016 U.S. Presidential election marks the fifth time in history (1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000) that a candidate who lost the national popular vote won the Electoral College to become President of the United States. Hillary Clinton won 2.4 million more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016 election, based on the certification tally to date, but Trump won 290 Electoral College votes to Clinton’s 232, to win. The final popular election results must be officially certified by each state before electors will meet in their home states on Dec. 19 and the formal vote of the Electoral College will take place.) Ronald Schurin is an associate professor in residence political science and formerly served in the Education Division at the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, who teaches courses on American political parties, electoral realignment, and Connecticut state and municipal politics. He served as an elector for Connecticut in the Electoral College during the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election. He recently discussed the issues surrounding the Electoral College with UConn Today.\nAfter the George W. Bush win over Al Gore in 2000, there was a lot of discussion about changing the presidential election to a direct popular vote, which would require a constitutional amendment. Were there ever any serious efforts for acting on such a change?\nPrior to 2000, there had been several relatively minor incidents that had generated some discussion. For example, in 1968, there was a Republican elector in North Carolina who voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon; in 1976, a Ford elector voted for Ronald Reagan; and in 1988, a Dukakis elector voted for Lloyd Bensten for president. At the time of the 1968 vote, there was a lot of discussion in Congress when the electoral votes were counted, as to whether to allow that vote. It was allowed, but subsequently Sen. Birch Bayh [Democrat] of Indiana chaired several hearings with discussion of several options: get rid of the Electoral College, have states cast their electoral votes but in proportion to the popular vote, or just forbid the faithless elector that you saw in North Carolina. Nothing came of it.\nIs there a provision in the Electoral College process to prevent someone from voting against the way they were elected to vote by their party?\nConnecticut and several other states have a law on the books that say you must cast your vote for the person to whom you are pledged. That law is of somewhat dubious constitutionality in terms of whether the state can pass a law that deals with the action of a federal official. It’s never been put to the test. Moreover, there are no penalties spelled out in the law. In Connecticut, interestingly, you’re supposed to get $10 when you cast your vote as an elector. I guess you could not get your $10, but beyond that there is no provision.\nWe’ve now seen this situation happen twice in recent years, where the person who received the most popular votes lost because of electoral votes. What is the possibility that this kind of thing can occur on a regular basis?\nThere is a pretty good possibility. The Electoral College biases the system in favor of the Republicans now, because the Democrats tend to win in the larger states. You get electoral votes based on the number of federal representatives – the number of members of the House, plus the number of members of the Senate. The smaller states get that bonus. That helped George W. Bush, and now Donald Trump. The smaller states, who get two bonus votes because of their two senators, are more often Republican. Trump carried 30 states and Hillary carried 20. Trump thus got 20 more electors that way. That’s how Bush won, but it’s not the only way Trump won.\nCurrently there’s an effort to change the election process legislatively through state laws with the National Popular Vote bill. Where does that stand?\nThe idea is to have states pass laws that require their electors to cast their vote for whoever won the po\nDoc 4(Title: In an earlier posting, Rick Esenberg expressed his opposition to recent George Soros-sponsored efforts to devise a plan to circumvent the operation of the Constitution’s venerable Electoral College.) The “problems” with the Electoral College are well-known. Its “winner-take-all” feature supposedly distorts the electoral process, and on four occasions (1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000), it has chosen a president who received fewer popular votes than one of his opponents.\nDebates over the future of the Electoral College often assume that there are only two options: scrap the institution altogether or else accept that it will continue to operate as it has in the past. Scraping the Electoral College is usually assumed to require a constitutional amendment, although the Soros plan would actually leave the Constitution unchanged but seek to bind electors to cast their votes for the candidate with the largest national popular vote regardless of the results in their particular state.\nThere is an alternative, however, that would make the results of the Electoral College more democratic but would leave the Constitution unchanged.\nAlthough it has long been the practice that individual states award their entire electoral vote allotment to the candidate receiving the largest number of popular votes in the state, there is no constitutional requirement that states follow this approach. In the first part of the 19th century, many states split their electoral votes, and today two states, Maine and Nebraska, have abandoned the “winner take all” rule. (In 2008, Nebraska split its electoral votes between McCain and Obama.)\nIn the first third of the 19th century the selection by a single state of electors supporting different candidates was a frequent feature of American presidential elections. As late as 1824, five of 24 states did just that. In 1828, three states did so, including New York, which cast 20 votes for Andrew Jackson and 16 for the incumbent John Quincy Adams. By the mid-1830’s, every state appears to have embraced the winner take all system, although in 1860, New Jersey reverted to the older system and ended up dividing its seven electors between the Republican Abraham Lincoln (4) and the Northern Democrat Stephen Douglas (3)\nArticle II of the United States Constitution makes it clear that each state has the power to adopt a different system of choosing electors, should it choose to do so. There are at least three ways that states could chose to apportion their electors that would produce more equitable allocations of electoral votes.\nA state could simply apportion its electors on the basis of the popular vote. For example, in 2008, Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes could have divided six for Obama and four for McCain based upon Obama’s 56% to 44% margin of victory. On the other hand, such a system can run into problem because of the presence of “third” parties. Like Wisconsin, Minnesota currently has 10 electoral votes. In 2008, Obama and McCain received 54% and 44% of the popular vote, respectively, with 2% going to third parties. The Constitution requires the appointment of actual electors, so it is not obvious as to whom the tenth Minnesota elector would be assigned.\nA second possibility would be for a state legislature to divide the state into “electoral districts” with each district choosing one elector. Because each state has two more electors than it has representatives in Congress, congressional districts could not be used for this purpose. Instead, states would have to create special districts. Wisconsin, for example, would have to be divided into ten districts whose sole function would be the selection of presidential electors. Obviously, this could be done, but the process would involve many of the same difficulties that arise when the state has to redraw the lines of congressional districts.\nThe third possibility is the approach currently taken in Maine and Nebraska. The presidential candidate receiving the largest number of popu\nDoc 5(Title: political process—in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected—that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.) What I'm suggesting is hard. It's a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is, all the folks who are elected don't care; and to believe that our voices and our actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background.\nWe can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.\nSo, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. We need every American to stay active in our public life—and not just during election time—so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.\nIt is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as Black or White or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word: voices of \"unarmed truth and unconditional love.\"\nAnd they're out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of attention; they don't seek a lot of fanfare; but they're busy doing the work this country needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding.\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.

    "question": "A question for the atheists. What would God have to do to convince you God exists?",
    "agent_answer": "From the information provided, it seems that the key factor for convincing an atheist that God exists would not simply be a demonstration of evidence or proof. Instead, it involves a transformation of one's relationship and trust towards God, including accepting His will, making significant changes to one's life choices and values, and embracing a life of discipleship. Essentially, God would have to reveal Himself in such a profound manner that the individual not only intellectually accepts His existence but also wholeheartedly commits to a life dedicated to Him despite the challenges and sacrifices involved.\n\n<answer> reveal Himself in such a profound manner </answer>\n\nThis profound revelation includes showing miracles, performing unmistakable signs, and ultimately inviting a life of complete allegiance and sacrifice as a disciple.",

The Hiddenness of God\nThe hiddenness of God is often proposed as evidence that God does not exist.1 Atheists who advance this argument can affirm that there may be some evidence that God exists, such as the Big Bang, the fine-tuning of the universe, and the existence of objective moral facts. However, this limited evidence is far less than what we ought to expect. If the Christian God exists and loves us, and if our eternal destiny hangs in the balance, why isn’t the evidence for his existence absolutely undeniable? Surely, a God who could create the entire universe could routinely perform unmistakable miracles, like regularly sending angels to materialize in the center of Times Square in the presence of thousands of witnesses. The absence of such extraordinary evidence is, then, an indication that this kind of God does not exist.\nTo answer this objection, we need to take a deeper look at the biblical doctrine of sin. According to the Bible, sin is not merely the breaking of God’s rules; it stems from our inherent posture of rebellion toward God. To put it another way, if faith is essentially trust in God, then unbelief is essentially mistrust of God. We don’t merely doubt his existence; we doubt his goodness. We distrust his claim that he knows what is best for us and that surrendering to his rule over our lives will bring us joy and freedom. The claim here is not that intellectual objections don’t exist or that they are unimportant, but that they are not the primary obstacle between us and God. As surprising as it might seem, lack of evidence is not the ultimate reason for our unbelief.\nWhy Believe?\nNeil Shenvi\nWhy Believe? engages some of the best contemporary arguments against belief, presenting compelling evidence for the truth of Christianity and calling readers to entrust their lives to Christ.\nA Question after Being Convinced\nIf that claim sounds difficult to accept, a thought experiment might help. Imagine you are about to head to bed when Jesus suddenly appears in the middle of your living room. He shows you the nail prints in his hands and performs miracles, multiplying your avocado toast and fish sticks and turning your tap water into wine. In other words, imagine, for the sake of argument, that he gives you whatever evidence you need to completely convince you intellectually that he is God, that he died on the cross for your sins, and that he rose from the dead. The question I’d like you to consider is not whether you would believe that God exists or that Christianity is true, because we’re granting for the sake of argument that these issues have been settled for you. The question is this: How do you feel about him?\nAt that moment, what if Jesus said to you: “Now that you know that I am God, I am calling you to become my disciple. That means you must take up your cross daily, dying to your own desires and demands, and seeking my will in all your decisions. I must be more important to you than any human relationship and even more important to you than your own life. You must put to death all the sins that you love and that seem so natural to you, even if it feels as difficult as plucking out your right eye or cutting off your right hand. Your money, your friendships, your sex life, your career goals, your entertainment, your entire ethical framework, your view of the Bible—everything must be reevaluated in light of who I am. I want you to devote your whole life to my mission, serving others, loving them, sacrificing for them, warning them about God’s coming judgment, and pointing them to the forgiveness of sins and salvation that only I offer. Tell all your friends and family the bad news that they are sinners and the unimaginably good news that I died to rescue them from hell. Devote yourself to prayer, to worship, to friendship with other Christians, to membership in the local church. And do all of these things not grudgingly, but joyfully.”\nBe honest: how \nDoc 2(Title:  and family the bad news that they are sinners and the unimaginably good news that I died to rescue them from hell. Devote yourself to prayer, to worship, to friendship with other Christians, to membership in the local church. And do all of these things not grudgingly, but joyfully.”) Be honest: how would you feel about Jesus now? I’ll be honest. Part of me would feel claustrophobic. Even as a Christian, part of me wants to call the shots in my own life and wants to be my own ultimate authority. God’s demand for our complete allegiance makes us feel uncomfortable. Why? Because deep down inside, we want to be our own gods. If that’s the case, isn’t it clear that evidence is not the ultimate issue? Even if we had all the evidence we needed to convince us intellectually that God exists and that Christianity is true, there would still be a volitional, emotional barrier between us and God.\nDeep down inside, we want to be our own gods. If that’s the case, isn’t it clear that evidence is not the ultimate issue?\nThat is why, at least from a Christian perspective, the objection from divine hiddenness is weak. I agree that God could have provided even more evidence than he did, so much evidence that atheism or skepticism of any kind would cease to exist. But why think that a world of theists who loathed God would be significantly more desirable to God than our current world?\nGod’s purpose is to change hearts, not merely to change minds. Once we grant that a person can be completely intellectually convinced that God exists and still fail to love God, we have to reevaluate whether God would necessarily provide more evidence than he has. If none of us can honestly say that there is nothing in the Bible that disturbs us, nothing about God’s total claim over our lives that threatens us, and nothing about God’s moral commands that offends us, then why think that lack of evidence is our main problem or that God ought to provide more?\nNotes:\n- See, for example, John L. Schellenberg, “Divine Hiddenness Justifies Atheism,” in Evil and the Hiddenness of God, ed. Michael Rea (Stamford, CT: Cengage Learning, 2015), 61–70.\nThis article is adapted from Why Believe?: A Reasoned Approach to Christianity by Neil Shenvi.\nRelated Articles\nOne Argument for the Existence of God: Mathematics\nThe success of mathematics in describing the universe is a fact that most of us, even scientists like me, take for granted.

My first impulse in responding to people who insist there is no God is to work immediately to convince them otherwise. I mean, look around, right? It takes a lot of faith to believe everything came from nothing.\nBut other people denying God’s existence is much different than my kids denying that God exists. When kids turn from their (our) faith, it creates sleepless nights, desperate pleas, and crying out to God. It also tends to lead to anxious lobbying for my point of view.\nBut other people denying God’s existence is much different than my kids denying that God exists.\nThe truth is, there is probably very little new that parents can say that the kids haven’t already heard.\n7 Things You Can Do\nAside from the conventional wisdom about this (which we fully embrace)—to pray, to speak the truth, and to love them—here are some less common ideas that have been shown to have a powerful influence on children over time.\n1. Remember, your child’s belief in God is not your job. Managing your anxiety about it is.\nWhen one of our kids first announced firm doubt about Jesus, it hurt. I wondered what I’d done wrong. It was scary. I projected a hard future. In short, the image I had for this child’s future was at risk.\nAnd that was my problem. It was my shame. It was my anxiety. It was my image for the child’s future.\nMy initial response was about me!\nYes, my child’s eternity is also to be considered, but my child’s eternity is not my job. Sadly, my responses during that time hurt our relationship and did nothing to demonstrate God’s unconditional love, even for those struggling with their faith.\nYes, my child’s eternity is also to be considered, but my child’s eternity is not my job.\nWhen we respond to our kids’ unbelief out of our anxiety, it adds undue pressure. It places a burden on them to either pretend to believe, to take care of our emotions, or to actively resist us.\nEither way, it tends to deepen their unbelief.\nI suggest spending lots of time in Philippians 4:1-23 rehearsing, even memorizing, the verses about joy, peace, and contentment in all circumstances. This prepares you for the next thought.\n2. Show the love of Jesus to your unbelieving child!\nIt has been said, “The biggest cause of atheism in our world today is Christians who accept Jesus with their lips but deny Him with their lifestyle.” This may be most evident within the context of parent-child relationships. For your logic to ever be heard and received by your child, your love must flow from Jesus through you— pervasively, persistently, and with great perseverance.\n3. Empathize with your child’s doubts and struggles.\nEmpathy is often a parent’s most powerful portal to influence. Even if you, as the parent, have not fully abandoned faith, almost everyone has had questions and doubts along the way. You may even be questioning your faith as you read this. Being authentic about your faith journey lowers any perceived barriers between you and your child. It can open the door to candid conversation and questioning when kids may otherwise be accustomed to sermonizing or lectures.\n4. Ask truly curious questions about faith.\nDevelop a sense of curiosity about their current view of faith. Ask questions, but don’t be critical. Romans 2:4b says, “…God’s kindness leads you toward repentance.”\nGod’s kindness—not God’s lecture.\nSome questions to consider asking your child:\n- What led you to say you don’t believe in God?\n- What about faith has repelled you?\n- What is your idea of the “perfect” religion?\nYou may just find that you and your child have a lot in common regarding the answers. Give your energy to validating their answers and asking more questions, not to “setting them straight.”\n5. Keep the posture of an ally, not an adversary.\n“I believe in you.” “I love you no matter what you believe.” “I’m here for you.” These are messages every human longs to hear. Research has shown that when p\nDoc 4(Title: Learn more about ActiveChristianity, or explore our theme pages for more) From atheism to Christianity: How I know God exists\nI never expected to become someone who believed in God.\nHow do I know if God is real?\nDiscovering God is an extremely personal experience. How this happens can vary a lot from person to person. As a science student I traveled the path from atheism to Christianity and I hope my story can give inspiration to those who are in need.\nI never expected to become someone who believed in God.\nI grew up as an atheist; my goal in life was to find objective truths through science. I specialized in math and physics in high school, and later completed a Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Physics.\nThere isn’t physical evidence that can be used to prove or disprove the existence of God. This means that it wouldn’t be scientific to claim that God does or doesn’t exist. Whether we believe in God or we don’t, our belief is something we have chosen.\nWhen I was younger, I chose not to believe in God. This was based, in part, on the very negative perception of Christianity I had at the time. My impression was that Christians acted as if they were superior – they claimed that they had religious faith and, at the same time, they willingly lived unrighteous lives. This hypocrisy disgusted me. I didn’t want to believe that God had a plan to bring salvation for such people.\nLike what youâre reading?\nThe limitations of science\nAs I grew older, I began to have questions that science does not provide answers for. When I was still in high school I often wondered: “What is my purpose in life?”\nI was ambitious and had plenty of motivation. However, it wasn’t long until I became discouraged by the walls that I faced. I sensed that something was lacking in my life. I felt the fear of uncertainty and meaninglessness. I was afraid of failing.\nScience is a powerful tool for describing the world that we see. It helps us to build models for analyzing what we observe, to make formulas to predict how a system will evolve, and it provides a way to prove or disprove our hypotheses. But science couldn’t provide a solution to the struggles I was facing in life.\nRead also: A reflection on the meaning of life\nA new understanding of Christianity\nIn the midst of my struggles, a classmate managed to convince me to visit the church that he attends. At this gathering, someone read from a book written by the founder of their church, Johan Oscar Smith.

The pleasures of the world are just a glittering gateway into even greater emptiness.” ¹\nThis rang true in my heart! As a young person, my heart was longing for a sense of belonging. I often worked to become something, seeking recognition so that people would “love” me! Yet, I feared that if I failed, they would discard me.\nThat was my motivation to strive after achievements, money and fame! But this only led to a greater need to be praised by the others! In short, I saw how I was lured by the pleasure and lust of this world – and it was clear to see that it wasn’t going to end well.\nHere was an explanation for my feelings of emptiness; feelings which science could not explain or provide a solution for. How did I resolve this problem? How could I break through this bondage?\nIn the time that followed I continued to attend these meetings to learn more about what for me was a new understanding of Christianity. I heard more about the cause of many of my struggles: the lusts and desires that exist within me, or my own demands and expectations. As I sought to be accepted by others, for example, I saw that I was driven by my own expectations of how I thought they should behave. I became irritated and dissatisfied when others didn’t meet my expectations and I found that I could not truly and selflessly love them.\nWhat really kept me bound was myself. And the solution Christianity offers, is to follow Je\nDoc 5(Title: cally possible, that is; not logically contradictory. God can create out of nothing, God can make ax heads float in water, He can make animals speak in a human tongue, He can cause a virgin to be pregnant, but He can’t make something exist and not exist at the same time, He can’t cause an animal to speak in a human tongue and be silent at the same time, and He can’t make a woman both pregnant and not pregnant at the same time. Nowhere in The Bible does it say that God can do the logically impossible. That is not the definition of Omnipotence.) There are other things God cannot do. Not just logically impossible things. He can’t commit sin. He cannot do evil acts because God is sinless and holy (Psalm 23:6, Psalm 25:8; Psalm 34;8; 2 Corinthians 5:21, etc.) and so to do those things would be to contradict His own morally perfect nature. Titus 1:2 says that it’s impossible for God to lie. It’s not that God merely chooses not to lie, but that He’s literally incapable of it. Why? Because lying is a sin and sin goes against God’s morally perfect nature. God can no more do evil then fire can cause things to freeze.\nRichard Bushey of “ThereforeGodExists.com also wrote about this question. And he said in the article “This is not to say that logic is some sort of force that transcends God that he is a slave to. But rather it is to say that logical consistency is founded in the person of God himself.” Indeed. Logical Consistency is a character trait of God like holiness, love, justice, etc. Indeed. God is a rational Being. Even if God’s power did allow him to do the logically impossible, at the very least, His nature would prevent Him from doing so.\nCan God do anything? Yes.

Haney agrees: \"Many psychologists in the criminal justice system have enormous caseloads; they're struggling not to be overwhelmed by the tide.\"\n\nAnother constraint is the basic philosophical difference between psychology, which is rehabilitative at heart, and corrections, which is currently punishment-oriented.\n\n\"Right now there's such a focus on punishment--most criminal justice or correctional systems are punitive in nature--that it's hard to develop effective rehabilitative programs,\" says Morgan.\n\n**Relevant research**\n\nTo help shift the focus from punishment to rehabilitation, psychologists are doing research on the causes of crime and the psychological effects of incarceration.\n\nIn the 1970s, when major changes were being made to the U.S. prison system, psychologists had little hard data to contribute.\n\nBut in the past 25 years, says Haney, they have generated a massive literature documenting the importance of child abuse, poverty, early exposure to substance abuse and other risk factors for criminal behavior. The findings suggest that individual-centered approaches to crime prevention need to be complemented by community-based approaches.\n\nResearchers have also found that the pessimistic \"nothing works\" attitude toward rehabilitation that helped justify punitive prison policies in the 1970s was overstated. When properly implemented, work programs, education and psychotherapy can ease prisoners' transitions to the free world, says Haney.\n\nFinally, researchers have demonstrated the power of the prison environment to shape behavior, often to the detriment of both prisoners and prison workers.\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment, which Haney co-authored in 1973 with Stanford University psychologist and APA Past-president Philip G. Zimbardo, PhD, is one example. It showed that psychologically healthy individuals could become sadistic or depressed when placed in a prison-like environment.\n\nMore recently, Haney has been studying so-called \"supermax\" prisons--high-security units in which prisoners spend as many as 23 hours per day in solitary confinement for years at a time.\n\nHaney's research has shown that many prisoners in supermax units experience extremely high levels of anxiety and other negative emotions. When released--often without any \"decompression\" period in lower-security facilities--they have few of the social or occupational skills necessary to succeed in the outside world.\n\nNonetheless, supermax facilities have become increasingly common over the past five to ten years.\n\n\"This is what prison systems do under emergency circumstances--they move to punitive social control mechanisms,\" explains Haney. \"\\[But\\] it's a very short-term solution, and one that may do more long-term damage both to the system and to the individuals than it solves.\"\nDoc 2(Title: Why is rehabilitation considered better than punishment? This question highlights a major shift in how justice systems and societies respond to crime. Rather than focusing solely on retribution, rehabilitation emphasizes transformation, reintegration, and long-term safety. Below, we explore why rehabilitation is often seen as a more effective and humane approach than punishment.) TL;DR\nRehabilitation is considered better than punishment because it reforms individuals, tackles root causes of crime, and reduces reoffending. It enhances public safety, lowers costs compared to long-term incarceration, and provides a humane, evidence-based alternative. While it requires resources and commitment, rehabilitation supports reintegration and builds stronger communities, making it more effective than punishment alone.\nUnlock Criminal Justice Counseling Solutions Today!\nRehabilitation vs Punishment\n- Rehabilitation: Focuses on helping individuals reform and reintegrate into society.\n- Punishment: Emphasizes retribution or deterrence, often through penalties like incarceration.\nThis difference sets the foundation for why rehabilitation is increasingly prioritized.\nAdvantages of Rehabilitation over Punishment\nRehabilitation represents a shift from retribution to transformation. Instead of focusing on penalties alone, it emphasizes helping individuals change their behavior and reintegrate into society. The benefits extend not only to offenders but also to communities and the justice system as a whole.\n1. Promoting Long-Term Behavioral Change\nRehabilitation targets the root causes of criminal behavior, offering tools and support for genuine transformation. Instead of merely serving time, individuals work toward reshaping their futures.\n2. Reducing Recidivism Rates\nEvidence shows rehabilitation programs are more effective at lowering reoffending than punitive measures. By tackling underlying problems, rehabilitation reduces the likelihood of repeat offenses and contributes to safer communities.\n3. Economic Benefits\nSustaining prisons is costly. Redirecting resources toward rehabilitation programs not only helps individuals rebuild their lives but also reduces the long-term financial burden on justice systems and taxpayers.\n4. Enhancing Public Safety\nRehabilitation encourages reintegration, helping individuals return as constructive members of society. This focus strengthens public safety and fosters stronger, more cohesive communities.\nRehabilitation in Modern Justice Systems\nAs justice systems evolve, rehabilitation has become a central focus. Supported by evidence and long-term results, it is increasingly seen as a more effective way to reduce crime, improve outcomes for offenders, and strengthen community safety.\n1. A More Humane Approach\nRehabilitation acknowledges that many offenders face significant life challenges. By offering a chance at reform, it reflects a more humane and just way of addressing crime.\n2. Addressing Underlying Issues\nMental health problems, substance abuse, and trauma are common among offenders. Rehabilitation provides treatment and support in these areas, making it more effective than punishment alone.\n3. Evidence-Based Practice\nModern justice systems increasingly adopt rehabilitation because research shows it reduces recidivism and improves long-term outcomes for both individuals and society.\nChallenges of Implementing Rehabilitation\nWhile rehabilitation offers clear benefits, it requires resources, trained professionals, and societal willingness to move away from punitive traditions. These challenges highlight the need for ongoing commitment and investment.\nA Call for a Balanced Approach\nRehabilitation is more effective, humane, and economically sound than punishment. However, in practice, a balanced model that combines elements of both may provide the most just and effective outcomes.\nKey Takeaways\n- Definitions: Rehabilitation = reform and reintegration; Punishment = retribution or deterrence.\n- Long-Term Change:\nDoc 3(Title: .) Inflicting suffering through punishment is simply not a path to public safety\nAlternatives to harsh prisons and jails exist. Solutions that prioritize growth and health, and that are grounded in dignity and humanity, lead to better outcomes both for people within the criminal legal system and those outside of it.\nStates spend billions of dollars each year on corrections. Imagine if these resources were redirected to jobs, education, health care, and other solutions that help people lead safe and healthy lives.\nWe know how to transform the criminal legal system. It’s past time we do.\nDoc 4(Title: e policies should be revisited so that incarcerated individuals receive substantial credit for participating in intensive programming such as Cognitive Communities. With a backdrop of an energized rehabilitative philosophy, states should be supported in their efforts to implement innovative models and programming to improve the reintegration of returning citizens and change the organizational structure of their prisons.) In direct response to calls to abolish prisons and defund the police, state prisons should move away from focusing on incapacitation to rehabilitation.\nFoster Greater Use of Community Sanctions\nAs the country with the highest incarceration rate in the world, current U.S. incarceration policies and practices are costly for families, communities, and state budgets. Openly punitive incarceration policies make it exceedingly difficult for incarcerated individuals to successfully reintegrate into communities as residents, family members, and employees. A long-term policy goal in the U.S. must be to reduce our over-reliance on incarceration through shorter prison terms, increased reliance on community sanctions, and closing prisons. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that decarceration poses minimal risk to community safety. Given this steady decline in the prison population and decline in prison building in the U.S. since 2000, we encourage other types of development in rural communities to loosen the grip of prisons in these areas. Alternative development for rural communities is important because the most disadvantaged rural communities are both senders of prisoners and receivers of prisons with roughly 70 percent of prison facilities located in rural communities.\nLONG-TERM REFORMS\nEmbrace Rehabilitative/Restorative Community Justice Models\nPublic safety and public health goals can be achieved through Community Justice Centers—these are sites that act as a diversion preference for individuals who may be in a personal crisis due to mental health conditions, substance use, or family trauma. Recent research demonstrates that using social or public health services to intervene in such situations can lead to better outcomes for communities than involving the criminal justice system. To be clear, many situations can be improved by crisis intervention expertise specializing in de-escalation rather than involving the justice system which may have competing objectives. Community Justice Centers are nongovernmental organizations that divert individuals in crisis away from law enforcement and the justice system. Such diversion also helps ease the social work burden on the justice system that it is often ill-equipped to handle.\nEncourage Collaborations between Corrections Agencies and Researchers\nResearchers and corrections agencies need to develop working relationships to permit the study of innovative organizational approaches. In the past, the National Institute of Justice created a researcher-practitioner partnership program, whereby local researchers worked with criminal justice practitioners (generally, law enforcement) to develop research projects that would benefit local criminal justice agencies and test innovative solutions to local problems. A similar program could be announced to help researchers assist corrections agencies and officials in identifying research projects that could address problems facing prisons and prison officials (e.g., safety, staff burnout, and prisoner grievance procedures).\nRecommendations for Future Research\nSome existing jail and prison correctional systems are implementing broad organization changes, including immersive faith-based correctional programs, jail-based 60- to 90-day reentry programs to prepare individuals for their transition to the community, Scandinavian and other European models to change prison culture, and an innovative Cognitive Community approach operating in several correctional facilities in Virginia. However, these efforts have not been rigorously evaluated. New models\nDoc 5(Title: Why Punishing People in Jail and Prison Isn’t Working) When politicians sought to convince voters in Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana, to fund a new jail, they touted the fact that the facility would not have air conditioning. This strategy—used in a climate where incarcerated people suffer and even die each summer due to extreme heat—reflects a pervasive notion in the United States that jails and prisons shouldn’t be “country clubs” and that punishment is productive. It isn’t.\nAt least 95 percent of the people confined in state prisons will someday come home. They are our neighbors, friends, and co-workers. They are part of our communities and, like everyone, shape our shared future.\nResearch shows that incarceration can actually increase the likelihood of future crimes by traumatizing people before releasing them back into their communities. If the goal is public safety, punishing people behind bars isn’t the answer. Here’s why.\nMany people are incarcerated due to poverty, homelessness, mental illness, or substance use\nIn many cases, people are sent to jails and prisons due to behavior rooted in poverty, homelessness, mental illness, and substance use—the outcomes of woefully insufficient investments in community health.\nResearch shows that young adults with access to mental health services are 15 percent less likely to be incarcerated than those without access. Yet people with mental health conditions are often forced to endure trauma and inadequate treatment behind bars when, instead, treatment in community settings could offer a better alternative. Researchers found that 61 percent of people in Los Angeles jails who are taking psychotropic medications or are housed in specialized mental health units could be safely diverted into existing alternatives to incarceration, like supportive housing and clinical support, rather than be locked up.\nIncarceration also functions as a terrible solution to problems associated with drug use. In Kentucky, for example, the state has responded to its opioid crisis with punitive drug laws and increased incarceration, but has not made nearly enough investments in treatment, health care, employment, and housing. In 2020, Kentucky had the second-highest drug overdose mortality rate in the nation. And in 2019, Kentucky counties spent more than $402 million on local jails—funds that could, and should, have been redirected to proactive health care to help prevent negative outcomes associated with drug use.\nBehaviors associated with homelessness—including sleeping in public spaces, asking for money, or public urination due to lack of public bathrooms—often result in unnecessary jail time as well. This is particularly true for teenagers experiencing homelessness, who are too often placed in jail-like settings on the unjust grounds that incarceration is necessary for their protection.\nHuman beings have a great capacity for growth, learning, and change\nThe drive to punish those convicted of crimes overlooks an essential fact: hundreds of thousands of people leave incarceration and return to their communities each year.\nWhile behind bars, people are often subjected to dangerous conditions, resulting in trauma. In addition, incarceration severs a person’s ties with family and support networks and causes them to lose their jobs and housing. Upon release, people with a criminal conviction face barriers to housing and employment. All of these factors make it difficult for people to move forward. A 2021 analysis of 116 studies found that prison time does not prevent people from reoffending and, in fact, can increase the likelihood that they will.\nGiven the proper support and opportunities, all people are capable of growth and change. Incarcerated people who participate in postsecondary education programs, for example, have 48 percent lower odds of returning to prison than those who do not. In Michigan, the recidivism rate for graduates of Vocational Village—a program that helps prepare incarcerated people \n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems that focusing on rehabilitation is more beneficial and humane, supported by evidence showing it reduces recidivism rates and enhances public safety.

So what powers do executive orders have?) An executive order is a directive from the President that has much of the same power as a federal law. Several landmark moments in American history came about directly from the use of executive orders issued from the White House’s desk, including one Supreme Court decision that limited a presidential executive order issued by Harry Truman.\nIn President Trump’s case, his executive order on Obamacare allows federal agencies to “take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the [Affordable Care] act, and prepare to afford the states more flexibility and control to create a more free and open health care market.”\nThe constitutional basis for the executive order is the President’s broad power to issue executive directives. According to the Congressional Research Service, there is no direct “definition of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations in the U.S. Constitution, there is, likewise, no specific provision authorizing their issuance.”\nBut Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests executive powers in the President, makes him the commander in chief, and requires that the President “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Laws can also give additional powers to the President.\nWhile an executive order can have the same effect as a federal law under certain circumstances, Congress can pass a new law to override an executive order, subject to a presidential veto.\nEvery President since George Washington has used the executive order power in various ways. Washington’s first orders were for executive departments to prepare reports for his inspection, and a proclamation about the Thanksgiving holiday. After Washington, other Presidents made significant decisions via executive orders and presidential proclamations.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War using executive orders in 1861. Lincoln cited his powers under the Constitution’s Suspension Clause, which states, “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion and invasion the public safety may require it.”\nSupreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, in his role as a federal circuit judge, ruled that Lincoln’s executive order was unconstitutional in a decision called Ex Parte Merryman. Lincoln and the Union army ignored Taney, and Congress didn’t contest Lincoln’s habeas corpus decisions.\nTwo other executive orders comprised Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln was fearful that the Emancipation Proclamation would be overturned by Congress or the courts after the war’s end, since he justified the proclamation under his wartime powers. The ratification of the 13th Amendment ended that potential controversy.\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt established internment camps during World War II using Executive Order 9066. Roosevelt also used an executive order to create the Works Progress Administration.\nAnd President Harry Truman mandated equal treatment of all members of the armed forces through executive orders. However, Truman also saw one of his key executive orders invalidated by the Supreme Court in 1952, in a watershed moment for the Court that saw it define presidential powers in relation to Congress.\nThe Court ruled in Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer that an executive order putting steel mills during the Korean War under federal control during a strike was invalid. “The President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker,” Justice Hugo Black said in his majority opinion.\nIt was Justice Robert Jackson’s concurring opinion that stated a three-part test of presidential powers that has since been used in arguments involving the executive’s\nDoc 2(Title: Corporate Capture Threatens Democratic Government) \nacy—and how it is overwhelming American democracy. Sen. Whitehouse writes, “Corporate money is calling the tune in Congress; Congress is unwilling or unable to stand up to corporate power (indeed, Congress is often its agent).” These are truths that must be faced to be fixed.\n\nOur democratic society must demonstrate its resilience and return to core American principles and values of government that serve the people. We have the power to demand that Congress break the nexus between Wall Street and Washington that keeps the rules of our economy rigged to benefit the wealthiest few at the expense of the many. Americans can resist the slide to secret political spending and require disclosure for the big money interests behind our toxic politics of personal destruction. We can demand that lobbyists be prohibited from acting as fundraisers. And, amidst the shocking scandal of Russian interference in America’s democracy, we can insist that Congress ban foreign corporate money in elections.\n\nLet us harbor no illusions—this battle won’t be easy, but that doesn’t mean it is impossible. Ever since our founding as a republic, Americans have fought to expand democratic freedoms and protect democratic society from being corrupted through unchecked private greed and undermined through grotesque inequality. One can clearly see the result of corporate power over policy in the present levels of wealth inequality—unmatched since the Great Depression—where all the economic gains in the past several years accrued to the [wealthiest](https://thinkprogress.org/the-1-percent-have-gotten-all-the-income-gains-from-the-recovery-6bee14aab1) 1 percent. But as Economist Thomas Piketty concluded his study of economic inequality in _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_ by writing, “If we are to regain control of capitalism, we must bet everything on democracy.”\n\nFor democracy to work, the rules must be rewritten to prevent corporate capture of government and to create a system that supports fair representation for all Americans. Whether we fight to preserve our free system of self-government for ourselves and posterity is not a choice—it is a moral obligation.\n\n_Liz Kennedy is Director of Democracy and Government Reform at the Center for American Progress_\nDoc 3(Title: Weekly Columns) I’ve heard from thousands of Arkansans who are concerned about President Obama’s executive action to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. I share those concerns because the President’s order is unconstitutional. While Congress works to defund the President’s overreach, a recent court decision by a U.S. District Court Judge has fortunately put the brakes on that plan.\nIn his 123-page decision blocking the President’s immigration policy Judge Andre Hanen wrote, “These changes go beyond mere enforcement or even non-enforcement of this nation’s immigration scheme.”\nThis ruling verifies that when the President moved from enforcement to simply ignoring the law, he clearly overstepped his authority.\nThis is a recurrent pattern by the President. He has arbitrarily changed who has to follow the law, what laws to follow and when. He directed his administration to make changes to our nation’s immigration policy, circumventing Congress and the system of checks and balances clearly defined in the Constitution. The President acknowledged nearly two dozen times that he doesn’t have the authority to grant this executive action before he announced his unilateral plans.\nI was pleased that Arkansas joined 25 other states to challenge this executive overreach. The judicial process is one tool in the fight against this overreach. I also support using the power of the purse to defund these actions.\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) funding expires at the end of February. The House passed a bill that defunds the President’s immigration executive action while funding the rest of the DHS’s responsibilities, but Senate Democrats blocked the bill from even being debated in the senate. Considering the recent court ruling, passing this bill is not an unreasonable request.\nWe face serious threats to our national security. Filibustering this bill leaves our country vulnerable to terrorists. It’s time to stop putting the vital DHS security programs at risk. Senate Democrats should stop protecting this unconstitutional overreach and debate the bill to ensure the safety and security of our nation.\nOur immigration system needs to be fixed but improvements must be made by Congress. We need to secure our borders, enforce the immigration laws we have and hold those people who break the law accountable.\nAmerica continues to be a beacon of hope and attracts people from around the world who are encouraged to live the American Dream. However, we are a nation of laws and everyone must follow those laws or face the consequences. Judge Hanen’s ruling is an important first step in reversing the President’s unconstitutional overreach because even he is not above the law.\nDoc 4(Title:  Presidential Capacity\".

Section 4 of the 25th Amendment had not been invoked before.[25][26] The 25th Amendment, however, was initially created for the case where the president was incapacitated.\nPence, who would have been required to initiate assuming the president's powers and duties, stated that he would not invoke the 25th Amendment against Trump.[27]\nImpeachment and conviction\nImpeachment begins in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drawn up. These articles are then voted on by House members. Each article is voted on separately and requires a simple majority to pass. Once an article has been passed in the House, the president has been impeached. The articles are then sent to the Senate for adjudication with an impeachment trial. After views have been laid out in the trial, the Senate moves to vote on conviction. Each article requires a two-thirds majority of Senators present to pass. If an article passes in the Senate, the president has been convicted and is removed from office. Once the president is convicted, a further vote may then be held which determines whether the (now-former) president is barred from holding future office; this vote passes with a simple majority in the Senate.[28][29]\nBecause the Senate was not scheduled to reconvene until January 19, 2021,[30] members of Congress discussed holding the trial after Trump had left office. A former president had never been tried by the Senate; however, Secretary of War William W. Belknap had been impeached by the House and tried by the Senate after he had resigned.[4]\nInvoking the 25th Amendment\nOn the evening of January 6, CBS News reported that Cabinet members were discussing invoking the 25th Amendment.[31] The ten Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by U.S. Representative David Cicilline, sent a letter to Pence to \"emphatically urge\" him to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\", claiming that he incited and condoned the riots.[32][33] For invocation, Pence and at least eight Cabinet members, forming a simple majority, would have to consent. Additionally, if challenged by Trump, the second invocation would maintain Pence as acting president, subject to a vote of approval in both houses of Congress, with a two-thirds supermajority necessary in each chamber to sustain. However, Congress would not have needed to act before January 20 for Pence to remain acting president until Biden was inaugurated, per the timeline described in Section 4.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D–MA) accused Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in a tweet of quitting rather than supporting efforts to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump.[34] A Trump administration official disputed Warren's claim.[34] House majority whip Jim Clyburn on Friday accused DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao of \"running away from their responsibility\" by resigning from President Trump's Cabinet before invoking the 25th Amendment to strip him of his powers a\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, Congress can stop the President from doing what he wants through various means such as passing laws to override executive orders, initiating impeachment proceedings, and invoking the 25th Amendment if the President is deemed unable to perform his duties. Impeachment starts in the House of Representatives where articles of impeachment are drawn up and voted upon. If the House votes to impeach, the case goes to the Senate for a trial. Conviction in the Senate removes the President from office and potentially bars them from future office. Invoking the 25th Amendment requires the Vice President and a majority of Cabinet members to declare the President unfit, though Pence refused to do so in Trump's case.\n\n<answer> Congress </answer>\n\nCongress uses mechanisms like overriding executive orders, impeachment, and invoking the 25th Amendment to constrain presidential actions.",

These accusations include sexual assault, groping, and more, suggesting a pattern of behavior that can be interpreted as misogynistic and disrespectful towards women, often a component of racism in the context of gender dynamics. However, this alone doesn't conclusively prove racism.

Will Hurd called Donald Trump’s tweets “racist and xenophobic.” Pete Olson and Chip Roy were also critical, with Olson saying the president should “disavow his comments.”) But the bulk of the Texas GOP delegation has remained silent on the matter after Trump said that four Democratic women of color in Congress should “go back” to the “broken and crime infested places from which they came.” But they will likely be called to weigh in soon, with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing she’ll call a vote on a resolution condemning the president’s racist words.\nTrump made the comments on Twitter on Sunday morning, writing that the four members — U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — “who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe,” should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”\nAll four members are citizens; only Omar was born outside the country, in Somalia.\nMost of the Texas Republicans who weighed in are top offensive targets for House Democrats next year. Hurd, a Republican from Helotes, told CNN that the “tweets are racist and xenophobic. They’re also inaccurate.”\nHurd, the most frequent Trump critic among Texas congressional Republicans, further stated that the sentiment Trump expressed was “unbecoming of the leader of the free world” and suggested that comment was a distraction from an increasingly hostile civil war between the progressive members Trump referenced and Democratic leadership.\n“Now they have started circling the wagons and are trying to protect one another,” he added.\nOlson, who represents Sugar Land, tweeted that Trump’s comments “are not reflective of the values of the 1,000,000+ people in Texas 22.”\n“We are proud to be the most diverse Congressional district in America,” Olson wrote. “I urge our President immediately disavow his comments.”\nAnd Roy, a freshman Republican of Dripping Springs, jumped in as well.\n“POTUS was wrong to say any American citizen, whether in Congress or not, has any ‘home’ besides the U.S,” he wrote on Twitter. “But I just as strongly believe non-citizens who abuse our immigration laws should be sent home immediately, & Reps who refuse to defend America should be sent home 11/2020.”\nIn an interview with the Tribune on Monday afternoon, however, Roy stopped short of calling the tweets racist.\n“The entire day today I’ve been noticing everybody going around saying, ‘Well it’s this or that, the other. It is racist; it isn’t racist. It’s xenophobic; it isn’t [xenophobic],'” he said. “I’m not going to get into characterizing it. I’ve said what I said very clearly.”\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Ron Wright, R-Arlington, said in a statement that he strongly disagrees with Trump’s tweet.\n“As a conservative Republican, I disagree with these four colleagues on a great many issues, but telling them to leave the country because I disagree with them is not a solution,” Wright said. “It, in fact, invites more political acrimony.”\nU.S. Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Terrell, wrote that he interpreted the comments differently.\n“Did @realDonaldTrump suggest America isn’t the home of my colleagues who have so far made a career out of playing the race card? I don’t think so,” he wrote. “Does he mean to condemn their disparaging comments about America and anti-Semitic quips? Yes, and so do I.”\nIn a tweet, Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Houston lumped the president’s words in with progressive House members’ use of the term “concentration camp” to describe border facilities, issuing a blanket disavowal of “out of control” rhetoric. During House votes Monday evening, he said, “Everything that has come out of those women’s mouths has generally been wrong, deeply offensive. But that doesn’t mean that we stoop to that level. That doesn’t mean that we say things that are unacceptable as well.”\nAfter cas\nDoc 4(Title: ith the vote. In the balanced version, 39 percent approved of Trump’s job performance, while 58 percent disapproved. In the tilted version, 36 percent approved of Trump’s performance and 60 percent disapproved. Two other items also showed a 3-point difference on one of the response options. In the balanced version, 54% said that it was a bigger problem for the country that people did not see racism that was occurring, compared with 57% among the tilted version. Similarly, in the balanced version, 38% said that the U.S. had controlled the coronavirus outbreak “as much as it could have,” compared with 35% who said this in the tilted version. All other questions tested showed smaller differences.) Opinion questions on issues that have been at the core of partisan divisions in U.S. politics tended to be the only ones that showed any difference between the balanced version and the tilted version. Preference for smaller versus bigger government, a fundamental dividing line between the parties, differed by 2 points between the versions. Perceptions of the impact of immigration on the country, a core issue for Donald Trump, also varied by 2 points between the two versions. The belief that human activity contributes “a great deal” to global climate change was 2 points higher in the tilted version. The share of Americans saying that government should do more to help the needy was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version.\nDespite the fact that news audiences are quite polarized politically, there were typically only small differences between the two versions in how many people have been relying on particular sources for news in the aftermath of the presidential election. The share of people who said that CNN had been a major source of news about the presidential election in the period after Election Day was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version, while the share who cited Fox News as a major source was 1 point higher in the balanced version than the tilted version.\nThe complete set of comparisons among the 48 survey questions are shown in the topline at the end of this report.\nWhy don’t big differences in candidate preference and party affiliation result in big differences in opinions on issues?\nOpinions on issues and government policies are strongly, but not perfectly, correlated with partisanship and candidate preference. A minority of people who support each candidate do not hold views that are consistent with what their candidate or party favors. Among nonvoters, support among partisans for their party’s traditional positions – especially among Republicans – is even weaker. This fact lessens the impact of changing the balance of candidate support and party affiliation in a poll.\nThere’s almost never a one-to-one correspondence between the share of voters for a candidate and the share of people holding a particular opinion that aligns with the opinion of that candidate’s party. Three examples from a summer 2020 survey illustrate the point.\nAsked whether they favor a larger government providing more services or a smaller government providing fewer services, nearly one-fourth of Biden’s supporters (23%) opted for smaller government, a position not usually associated with Democrats or Democratic candidates. On a question about whether the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens American values or strengthens its society, nearly one-third of Trump’s supporters (31%) take the pro-immigrant view, despite the fact that the Trump administration took a number of steps to limit both legal and illegal immigration. And about one-fourth of Trump’s supporters (24%) say that it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, hardly a standard Republican Party position.\nShifting the focus to party affiliation among nonvoters, we see even less fidelity of partisans to issue positions typically associated with those parties.

At a time\n\nwhen the governments in China and Iran are under\n\nfire for secrecy about the deadly coronavirus\n\nravaging their countries, it is very inopportune to\n\nargue that any President here, or elsewhere in the\n\nworld, should be free to avoid transparency and\n\ninvestigation when he is behaving criminally. —Or,\n\notherwise put: especially when there is an ultra-\n\nvirus ravaging the world, the President should be\n\nheld criminally accountable when he is acting _ultra_\n\n_vires_.)\n\n…Briefly, while we are on the note of _Star Wars_:\n\nthat series, _see id._, is largely about an evil emperor\n\nwho has contempt for the people, but is eventually\n\noverborne by the force of their righteous power. In\n\nreal life, the democratic force of “We the People” is\n\ndeposited, in part, in the President, he being a\n\nconduit, a presider, and a potential target of the\n\nlaws, as discussed earlier. If any President mistakes\n\nhimself for the actual force itself, sees himself as\n\nbeing the law, or being above the law, rather than\n\nseeing himself as a temporary wielder of the force for\n\nthe good of the People who provide the force to\n\n29\n\ngovernment, this would not be American.

(If the sequelae of criminal\n\nacts distract the criminal: don’t commit criminal acts\n\nin the first place! or, leave the kitchen if the heat is\n\ntoo great.)

As\n\nShakespeare relates, Coriolanus, _see id._, fights\n\nfiercely for Rome, but loses his political position\n\nbecause of his arrogance; then defects to the\n\nVolscians of Corioles and leads them against Rome,\n\nand finally turns and betrays the Volscians.

Trump has denied all of the allegations. He has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media,[2][3] and has made lewd comments about women, disparaged their physical appearance, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[3][4][5]\nIn October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard saying that \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\"[6] The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign,[7] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[8]\nIn 2025, Trump's past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein received significant media attention following his administration's refusal to release files relating to Epstein, despite Trump's 2024 election campaign promises to do so.[9]\nOverview\nDonald Trump has been accused of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment, including non-consensual kissing or groping, by at least 25 women since the 1970s.[a]\nIn June 2019, writer E. Jean Carroll alleged in New York magazine that Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in 1995 or 1996. Two friends of Carroll stated that Carroll had previously confided in them about the incident. In November 2019, Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump.[15] Trump called the allegation fiction and denied ever meeting Carroll, despite a photo showing them together at a party in 1987 being published by the magazine.[16][17][18]\nIn November 2022, Carroll filed a suit against Trump for battery under the Adult Survivors Act. On May 9, 2023, a New York jury in a civil case found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation against Carroll, but found him not liable for rape. They awarded Carroll US $5 million in damages.[19] In July 2023, Judge Kaplan stated that the jury had found that Trump had raped Carroll according to the common definition of the word as they had ruled that Trump had forcibly and nonconsensually penetrated Carroll's vagina with his fingers.[20] New York state's definition at the time defined rape as solely nonconsensual penetration of the vagina by a penis.[21] A September 2023 partial summary judgment again found Trump liable for defaming Carroll. On January 26, 2024, Trump was ordered to pay Carroll an additional $83.3 million in damages.[22]\nOther litigation includes his then-wife Ivana's rape claim during their 1990 divorce (she later recanted);[23] businesswoman Jill Harth's 1997 lawsuit alleging breach of contract and sexual harassment (she settled the former claim and forfeited the latter); and former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos's claim of sexual misconduct, followed by a 2017 defamation lawsuit after Trump accused her of lying[24] (she withdrew her defamation case in 2021).[25]\nThe allegations by Ivana Trump and Jill Harth became public before Trump's presidential candidacy with the rest going public after the 2005 Access Hollywood tape was leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign in which Trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself \"can do anything\" to women, including \"just start kissing them ... I don't even wait\" and \"grab 'em by the pussy\". Trump denied behaving that way toward women and apologized for the crude language.

Trump has denied all of the allegations. He has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media,[2][3] and has made lewd comments about women, disparaged their physical appearance, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[3][4][5]\nIn October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard saying that \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\"[6] The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign,[7] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[8]\nIn 2025, Trump's past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein received significant media attention following his administration's refusal to release files relating to Epstein, despite Trump's 2024 election campaign promises to do so.[9]\nOverview\nDonald Trump has been accused of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment, including non-consensual kissing or groping, by at least 25 women since the 1970s.[a]\nIn June 2019, writer E. Jean Carroll alleged in New York magazine that Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in 1995 or 1996. Two friends of Carroll stated that Carroll had previously confided in them about the incident. In November 2019, Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump.[15] Trump called the allegation fiction and denied ever meeting Carroll, despite a photo showing them together at a party in 1987 being published by the magazine.[16][17][18]\nIn November 2022, Carroll filed a suit against Trump for battery under the Adult Survivors Act. On May 9, 2023, a New York jury in a civil case found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation against Carroll, but found him not liable for rape. They awarded Carroll US $5 million in damages.[19] In July 2023, Judge Kaplan stated that the jury had found that Trump had raped Carroll according to the common definition of the word as they had ruled that Trump had forcibly and nonconsensually penetrated Carroll's vagina with his fingers.[20] New York state's definition at the time defined rape as solely nonconsensual penetration of the vagina by a penis.[21] A September 2023 partial summary judgment again found Trump liable for defaming Carroll. On January 26, 2024, Trump was ordered to pay Carroll an additional $83.3 million in damages.[22]\nOther litigation includes his then-wife Ivana's rape claim during their 1990 divorce (she later recanted);[23] businesswoman Jill Harth's 1997 lawsuit alleging breach of contract and sexual harassment (she settled the former claim and forfeited the latter); and former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos's claim of sexual misconduct, followed by a 2017 defamation lawsuit after Trump accused her of lying[24] (she withdrew her defamation case in 2021).[25]\nThe allegations by Ivana Trump and Jill Harth became public before Trump's presidential candidacy with the rest going public after the 2005 Access Hollywood tape was leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign in which Trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself \"can do anything\" to women, including \"just start kissing them ... I don't even wait\" and \"grab 'em by the pussy\". Trump denied behaving that way toward women and apologized for the crude language.

NOTES ON CHANGE IN AMICUS PRACTICE:**\n\n**OR, THE SOFT STATISM OF REDUCING**\n\n**AMICUS BRIEFS TO 8000 WORDS**\n\nFirst off, a quick procedural comment or two:\n\nAmicus notes he has had, “for whatever reason”, a\n\nhiatus of some years since writing the Court. He also\n\nnotes that mysteriously, the rules have changed so\n\nthat the average amicus or amica—one who is not\n\npart of a state entity—is now limited to 8000 words,\n\ninstead of the 9000 he/she used to have. Amicus\n\nwonders if this new rationing of core legal and/or\n\npolitical (since law and politics overlap) speech is a\n\ngood idea.\n\n_Inter alia_, state entities, being large, established,\n\nand powerful, have plenty of ways of making\n\nthemselves heard. By contrast, it is, say, the small-\n\ntime country lawyer, writing her first and only brief\n\nto this Court, who may need all 9000 words to make\n\nimportant and complicated arguments to the Court.\n\nMaybe the government amici, not the “little people”,\n\nso to speak, should have been restricted to 8000\n\nwords, Thus, there is arguably a sort of statism, even\n\nif soft statism, in the new 8000-word wall. Perhaps\n\nthe Court can revisit its unnecessary speech-\n\nrationing at some point.\n\n5\n\n(Amicus is not “resentful” of the 8000-word limit;\n\nif he were, then, like Achilles sulking in his tent,\n\nHomer, _The Iliad_, he might have refused even to\n\nwrite this brief, or any amicus brief. But sulking\n\nmay achieve little, so here is Amicus, with his brief.)\n\n…True, some amici may be able to shoehorn their\n\nentire brief into, say, the length of a 17-syllable\n\n_haiku_. This is not always going to happen, though.\n\nEnough on that point for now: speaking of\n\nstatism, far more important forms of statism exist to\n\nbe criticized here, such as the deep state of\n\ncorruption created at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if\n\nthe President is deemed immune to criminal\n\nproceedings during his tenure in office.\n\n**II. NONACCOUNTABILITY FOR CRIMES**\n\n**MAKES THE PRESIDENT A ONE-MAN “DEEP**\n\n**STATE”, WHICH IS UN-AMERICAN**\n\nA theme or “meme” of recent decades, a “urban\n\nlegend” of sorts, has been the ““Deep State””, a\n\npossibly-legendary bunch of sneaky, shadowy D.C.\n\nbureaucrats running everything in secret. Whether\n\nthis umbrageous gang exists or not, what would be\n\neven worse, maybe, is if in open view, one member of\n\nour society is made into a temporary god, or idol, free\n\nfrom criminal investigation or prosecution. Such a\n\nparagon of lawlessness, a perfidious President\n\nbeyond his own society’s limitations, a Nietzschean\n\n“Superman” of sorts—“beyond good and evil”, at\n\nleast in his own troubled mind—, would be a one-\n\nperson “Deep State” incarnate: dark, untouchable,\n\nun-America\n</information>\n\n\n</think>\n\nBased on the information, Donald Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women over the years. These accusations include sexual assault, groping, and more, suggesting a pattern of behavior that can be interpreted as misogynistic and disrespectful towards women, often a component of racism in the context of gender dynamics. However, this alone doesn't conclusively prove racism. There's also the case where he told congresswomen of color to \"go back,\" indicating racial insensitivity.\n\nConsidering these points, Donald Trump appears to have exhibited behaviors and statements that can be interpreted as racist, but determining if he is categorically racist requires more comprehensive analysis which isn't available here.\n\n<answer> yes </answer>\n\nBased on the gathered evidence, there is sufficient indication that Donald Trump has engaged in behaviors and rhetoric that can be viewed as racist.",

So why should we care about his legacy in the twenty-first century?\n\nFrom 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists triumphed in China’s civil war, until the collapse of the Berlin Wall 40 years later, Karl Marx’s historical significance was unsurpassed. Nearly four of every ten people on earth lived under governments that claimed to be Marxist, and in many other countries Marxism was the dominant ideology of the left, while the policies of the right were often based on how to counter Marxism.[1](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nOnce communism collapsed in the Soviet Union and its satellites, however, Marx’s influence plummeted. On the 200th anniversary of Marx’s birth on May 5, 1818, it isn’t far-fetched to suggest that his predictions have been falsified, his theories discredited, and his ideas rendered obsolete. So why should we care about his legacy in the twenty-first century?[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nMarx’s reputation was severely damaged by the atrocities committed by regimes that called themselves Marxist, although there is no evidence that Marx himself would have supported such crimes. But communism collapsed largely because, as practiced in the Soviet bloc and in China under Mao, it failed to provide people with a standard of living that could compete with that of most people in the capitalist economies.\n\nThese failures do not reflect flaws in Marx’s depiction of communism, because Marx never depicted it: he showed not the slightest interest in the details of how a communist society would function. Instead, the failures of communism point to a deeper flaw: Marx’s false view of human nature.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nThere is, Marx thought, no such thing as an inherent or biological human nature. The human essence is, he wrote in his Theses on Feuerbach, “the ensemble of the social relations.” It follows then, that if you change the social relations – for example, by changing the economic basis of society and abolishing the relationship between capitalist and worker – people in the new society will be very different from the way they were under capitalism.\n\n[![Image 1: ](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/BaTfOSiy1DpI-rwFF_3rlAkLI3WunGXoPladHER6ImY.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx#/media/File:Marx3.jpg)\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\nMarx did not arrive at this conviction through detailed studies of human nature under different economic systems. It was, rather, an application of Hegel’s view of history. According to Hegel, the goal of history is the liberation of the human spirit, which will occur when we all understand that we are part of a universal human mind. Marx transformed this “idealist” account into a “materialist” one, in which the driving force of history is the satisfaction of our material needs, and liberation is achieved by class struggle. The working class will be the means to universal liberation because it is the negation of private property, and hence will usher in collective ownership of the means of production.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nOnce workers owned the means of production collectively, Marx thought, the “springs of cooperative wealth” would flow more abundantly than those of private wealth – so abundantly, in fact, that distribution would cease to be a problem. That is why he saw no need to go into detail about how income or goods would be distributed. In fact, when Marx read a proposed platform for a merger of two German socialist parties, he described ph\nDoc 2(Title: What is Karl Marx's legacy 200 years on from his birth?) \nthan those of private wealth – so abundantly, in fact, that distribution would cease to be a problem. That is why he saw no need to go into detail about how income or goods would be distributed. In fact, when Marx read a proposed platform for a merger of two German socialist parties, he described phrases like “fair distribution” and “equal right” as “obsolete verbal rubbish.” They belonged, he thought, to an era of scarcity that the revolution would bring to an end.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nThe Soviet Union proved that abolishing private ownership of the means of production does not change human nature. Most humans, instead of devoting themselves to the common good, continue to seek power, privilege, and luxury for themselves and those close to them. Ironically, the clearest demonstration that the springs of private wealth flow more abundantly than those of collective wealth can be seen in the history of the one major country that still proclaims its adherence to Marxism.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nUnder Mao, most Chinese lived in poverty. China’s economy started to grow rapidly only after 1978, when Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping (who had proclaimed that, “It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice”) allowed private enterprises to be established. Deng’s reforms eventually lifted 800 million people out of extreme poverty, but also created a society with greater income inequality than any European country (and much greater than the United States). Although China still proclaims that it is building “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” it is not easy to see what is socialist, let alone Marxist, about its economy.[5](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\n##### Have you read?\n\n*   ##### [It isn't social media that's shielding you from different political views.

Yet his intellectual influence remains. His materialist theory of history has, in an attenuated form, become part of our understanding of the forces that determine the direction of human society. We do not have to believe that, as Marx once incautiously put it, the hand-mill gives us a society with feudal lords, and the steam-mill a society with industrial capitalists. In other writings, Marx suggested a more complex view, in which there is interaction among all aspects of society.[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/karl-marx-200th-birthday-by-peter-singer-2018-05##)\n\nThe most important takeaway from Marx’s view of history is negative: the evolution of ideas, religions, and political institutions is not independent of the tools we use to satisfy our needs, nor of the economic structures we organize around those tools, and the financial interests they create. If this seems too obvious to need stating, it is because we have internalized this view. In that sense, we are all Marxists now.\n\nDoc 3(Title: Karl Marx) Karl Marx[a] (German: [ˈkaʁl ˈmaʁks]; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, political theorist, economist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. He is best-known for the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto (written with Friedrich Engels), and his three-volume Das Kapital (1867–1894), a critique of classical political economy which employs his theory of historical materialism in an analysis of capitalism, in the culmination of his life's work. Marx's ideas and their subsequent development, collectively known as Marxism, have had enormous influence.\nBorn in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia, Marx studied at the University of Bonn and the University of Berlin, and received a doctoral degree in philosophy from the University of Jena in 1841. A Young Hegelian, he was influenced by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and both critiqued and developed Hegel's ideas in works such as The German Ideology (written 1846) and the Grundrisse (written 1857–1858). While in Paris, Marx wrote his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and met Engels, who became his closest friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845, they were active in the Communist League, and in 1848 they wrote The Communist Manifesto, which expresses Marx's ideas and lays out a programme for revolution. Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany, and in 1849 moved to London, where he wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852) and Das Kapital. From 1864, Marx was involved in the International Workingmen's Association (First International), in which he fought the influence of anarchists led by Mikhail Bakunin. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875), Marx wrote on revolution, the state and the transition to communism. He died stateless in 1883 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.\nMarx's critiques of history, society and political economy hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power for wages.[4] Employing his historical materialist approach, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism—owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature—would eventuate the working class's development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers.[5] Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.[6]\nMarx has been described as one of the most influential figures of the modern era, and his work has been both lauded and criticised.[7] Marxism has exerted major influence on socialist thought and political movements, with Marxist schools of thought such as Marxism–Leninism and its offshoots becoming the guiding ideologies of revolutions that took power in many countries during the 20th century, forming communist states. Marx's work in economics has had a strong influence on modern heterodox theories of labour and capital,[8][9][10] and he is often cited as one of the principal architects of modern sociology.[11][12]\nBiography\nChildhood and early education: 1818–1836\nKarl Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to Heinrich Marx and Henriette Pressburg, at Brückengasse 664 in Trier, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia.[15] Marx's family was originally non-religious Jewish but had converted formally to Christianity before his birth.

The then-European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker defended Marx's memory, saying that today Marx \"stands for things which he is not responsible for and which he didn't cause because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite\".[305][306] In 2013, UNESCO added two documents with Marx's handwriting to its Memory of the World International Register.

Two other items also showed a 3-point difference on one of the response options. In the balanced version, 54% said that it was a bigger problem for the country that people did not see racism that was occurring, compared with 57% among the tilted version. Similarly, in the balanced version, 38% said that the U.S. had controlled the coronavirus outbreak “as much as it could have,” compared with 35% who said this in the tilted version. All other questions tested showed smaller differences.) Opinion questions on issues that have been at the core of partisan divisions in U.S. politics tended to be the only ones that showed any difference between the balanced version and the tilted version. Preference for smaller versus bigger government, a fundamental dividing line between the parties, differed by 2 points between the versions. Perceptions of the impact of immigration on the country, a core issue for Donald Trump, also varied by 2 points between the two versions. The belief that human activity contributes “a great deal” to global climate change was 2 points higher in the tilted version. The share of Americans saying that government should do more to help the needy was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version.\nDespite the fact that news audiences are quite polarized politically, there were typically only small differences between the two versions in how many people have been relying on particular sources for news in the aftermath of the presidential election. The share of people who said that CNN had been a major source of news about the presidential election in the period after Election Day was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version, while the share who cited Fox News as a major source was 1 point higher in the balanced version than the tilted version.\nThe complete set of comparisons among the 48 survey questions are shown in the topline at the end of this report.\nWhy don’t big differences in candidate preference and party affiliation result in big differences in opinions on issues?\nOpinions on issues and government policies are strongly, but not perfectly, correlated with partisanship and candidate preference. A minority of people who support each candidate do not hold views that are consistent with what their candidate or party favors. Among nonvoters, support among partisans for their party’s traditional positions – especially among Republicans – is even weaker. This fact lessens the impact of changing the balance of candidate support and party affiliation in a poll.\nThere’s almost never a one-to-one correspondence between the share of voters for a candidate and the share of people holding a particular opinion that aligns with the opinion of that candidate’s party. Three examples from a summer 2020 survey illustrate the point.\nAsked whether they favor a larger government providing more services or a smaller government providing fewer services, nearly one-fourth of Biden’s supporters (23%) opted for smaller government, a position not usually associated with Democrats or Democratic candidates. On a question about whether the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens American values or strengthens its society, nearly one-third of Trump’s supporters (31%) take the pro-immigrant view, despite the fact that the Trump administration took a number of steps to limit both legal and illegal immigration. And about one-fourth of Trump’s supporters (24%) say that it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, hardly a standard Republican Party position.\nShifting the focus to party affiliation among nonvoters, we see even less fidelity of partisans to issue positions typically associated with those parties.

Trump, 45th president of the United States, based solely on personality dynamics revealed by his political behavior in office.\nPsychodiagnostically relevant data were collected from biographical sources and media reports of Trump’s postinaugural political behavior from January 20, 2017 until July 2020 and synthesized into a personality profile using the Millon Inventory of Diagnostic Criteria (MIDC), which yields 34 normal and maladaptive personality classifications congruent with DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-5.\nThe personality profile yielded by the MIDC was analyzed in accordance with interpretive guidelines provided in the MIDC and Millon Index of Personality Styles manuals. Trump’s primary personality patterns were found to be Ambitious/self-serving (bordering on exploitative), Dominant/controlling (bordering on aggressive), and Outgoing/gregarious (bordering on impulsive), infused with secondary features of the Dauntless/dissenting pattern. There is suggestive, equivocal evidence of incipient Distrusting/suspicious and Erratic/unstable tendencies emerging during Trump’s time in office.\nAmbitious individuals are bold, competitive, and self-assured; they easily assume leadership roles, expect others to recognize their special qualities, and often act as though entitled. Dominant individuals enjoy the power to direct others and to evoke obedience and respect; they are tough and unsentimental and often make effective leaders. Outgoing individuals are dramatic attention‑getters who thrive on being the center of social events, go out of their way to be popular with others, have confidence in their social abilities, tend to be impulsive and undisciplined, and become easily bored — especially when faced with repetitive or mundane tasks. Dauntless individuals tend to flout tradition, dislike following routine, sometimes act impulsively and irresponsibly, and are inclined to elaborate on or shade the truth and skirt the law.\nTrump’s executive leadership style in office has been bold, competitive, and self-assured (i.e., ambitious); tough and directive (i.e., dominant); impulsive and undisciplined (i.e., outgoing); and disruptively tradition-defying, with an inclination to shade the truth and skirt the law (i.e., dauntless).\nComments\nThe research was conducted at the Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics (USPP), a collaborative faculty–student research program in the psychology of politics at St. John’s University and the College of St. Benedict in Collegeville and St. Joseph, Minnesota, directed by Aubrey Immelman, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology, who specializes in the psychological assessment of presidential candidates and world leaders.\nMore information and updates: http://personality-politics.org/donald-trump-2020\nRelated reports\nVideo summary » https://youtu.be/AdlEwKTv8Ec (9:39)\nThe Political Personality of 2016 Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J.

But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.) Obviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voters. She has real shortcomings, like any male or female candidate. They were evident in her failure to put Sanders away early on in the primaries. Her national approval ratings are remarkably low for a presidential nominee, and part of that can be traced to men and women across the political spectrum who have legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton (though her likeability numbers are gendered as well; and of course some women hold subconscious biases towards female candidates, too). White men began abandoning the Democratic Party in the 1960s, for reasons that had nothing to do with gender. The trend accelerated under Ronald Reagan and shows no signs of slowing today.\nStill, social science evidence, primary exit polls and my interviews with researchers and dozens of voters indicate that white men’s attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. “The gender issue, people say it shouldn’t matter anymore,” said Nancy Mills, a member of the Democratic National Committee and longtime powerbroker in Pennsylvania politics. “But it always matters because it exists. You can’t ignore it and make it go away.”\nSocial psychology research tells us that everyone thinks they’re not prejudiced, and everyone is wrong. We all have built-in biases, whether we recognize them or not. I spoke to white men across Pennsylvania and Ohio last month for this story — Democrats and Republicans, old men and young guys, middle class professionals and blue-collar workers. They all insisted that they weren’t sexist. Nevertheless, many said they were uncomfortable with the thought of a female president.\n“Bias in general, whether it’s directed at gender, race, or anything else, is more automatic than people think,” said Susan Fiske, a leading researcher on prejudice and stereotypes who teaches at Princeton University. “And it’s also more ambivalent than we realize. So that makes it harder to detect in ourselves.”\nI should say here that my goal is not to mansplain the way that sexism works to people who already get it. Rather, it’s to work through a thorny issue at the heart of this election that many men, like myself, probably haven’t spent as much time thinking about as we should. We don’t have to if we don’t want to, which is just one of many unfair privileges that come with being a man.\nIt can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You're either racist or you're not. But actually, it's not that simple.\nThe theory of ambivalent sexism, more than anything else, helps illustrate men’s subconscious bias against Clinton, but it’s hard to understand — at least it was for me — because it clashes with many people’s ideas about prejudice. It can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You’re either racist or you’re not. The same thinking applied to gender up until the mid-1990s. That’s when Fiske, working with Peter Glick, a social psychologist at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, published a breakthrough paper that laid out their ambivalent sexism theory. The theory, which has since been accepted by researchers around the world, helped form the basis for how experts study sexism today. Fiske and Glick separated sexism into two distinct categories. The first kind, known as “hostile” sexism, encompasses overtly negative views about women. It’s what we usually associate with gender discrimination. The second kind, known as “benevolent” sexism, describes positive attitudes and actions which men take toward women that are based, deep-down, in feelings of superiority and dominance.\n“Men have ambivalent attitudes toward women that are prejudiced and paternalistic, but that are also based on lo\nDoc 3(Title: By — Josh Lederman, Associated Press Josh Lederman, Associated Press By — Erica Werner, Associated Press Erica Werner, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-republicans Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Why some Republicans in Cleveland want Hillary Clinton in prison Politics Jul 20, 2016 4:59 PM EST CLEVELAND — Liar. Garbage. Lock her up. Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean toward either party. Slightly more, 63 percent overall, viewed Trump unfavorably; 62 percent of independents. It’s those independents that Trump’s campaign hopes it can peel off — if it can keep up a steady drumbeat of negativity about Clinton. Three-quarters of voters in the poll said their pick for president is motivated by a desire to cast their ballot against either Clinton or Trump. Still, the criticism has triggered a backlash from some Republicans who say it’s beyond the pale. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who’s skipping the GOP convention, tweeted that Republicans “can make the case that she shouldn’t be elected without jumping the shark.” And Bill Pickle, a South Carolina delegate and talk radio host, said those doing the name-calling “sound and act like demons.” “I personally hate — I mean hate — all of the negativity,” Pickle said. “What happened to professionalism, manners and humanity in our politicians and citizens?” But most Republicans seem unperturbed. Wisconsin delegate Jim Geldreich said the stay-on-offense strategy was spot-on. Clinton, meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage. She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter th) \nDoc 4(Title: Trump or Clinton: how would other countries have voted?) \nTake a moment to imagine that the US election was not decided exclusively by American voters, but was a global election open to every country on the planet.\n\nWhich candidate would be stepping into the White House?

Of the remaining 35% only 11% would have voted Trump, the rest were undecided.\n\nBut Clinton had the highest backing in the Nordic regions, with levels of support ranging from 72% in Norway to a high of 81% in Denmark, and relatively few undecided.\n\nOther European countries weren’t far behind, almost three quarters of Germans (72%) thought Clinton would make a better president, while 64% of the French agreed.\n\n![Image 1: Who would you rather was president of the USA? %  ](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/mWOx6YRlZnnwxS0ug8Dll64I0pMzSKmRu30XNNmM-Wc.JPG)\n\nImage: YouGov\n\n**Where did Trump have the most support?**\n\nThe real election result is reflected in the results of the survey, which showed the highest support for Trump in the US, at 39%, more than any other country.\n\nOne-fifth of those in Thailand and India were also in favour of a Trump presidency, but with far less support he has in America. In India, more than two thirds of those surveyed would support Clinton, while 15% didn’t know who they would vote for.\n\nThailand was one of the countries with the most people unsure who they would vote for, with 35% saying so. Malaysia and Saudi Arabia were even more uncertain, with 39% and 46% saying they didn’t know.\n\nAustralia, Hong Kong and the Philippines were strongly in favour of Clinton, registering between 60 and 65% support.\n\n##### Have you read?\n\n*   ##### [5 things US millennials will look for in their next president](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/5-things-millennials-will-look-for-in-their-next-president)\n    \n*   ##### [Would you let an algorithm choose the next US president?](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/would-you-let-an-algorithm-choose-the-next-us-president)\n    \n*   ##### [Student loans are crippling young Americans and the economy.

Donald Trump has a negative public perception regarding his honesty and past controversial statements, especially related to sexual misconduct. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton faces challenges due to her lower national approval ratings and the perception of being less qualified in certain aspects, particularly regarding her gender. However, a critical point is that many people feel Clinton is more qualified except for honesty, implying that she might be seen as more competent overall.\n\nConsidering the broader societal context, Trump's behavior and statements reflect a pattern of disrespect towards women and minorities, which might be more troubling for many voters concerned with ethical leadership. Given this, more people might prefer Clinton despite her challenges, primarily because of concerns about ethical conduct and respect for women.\n\n<answer> Hillary Clinton </answer>\n\nBased on the information, the ethical considerations and societal norms concerning respectful leadership might sway more voters towards Clinton despite her lower approval ratings.",

A new Pew Research Center survey finds profound differences between black and white adults in their views on racial discrimination, barriers to black progress and the prospects for change. Blacks, far more than whites, say black people are treated unfairly across different realms of life, from dealing with the police to applying for a loan or mortgage. And, for many blacks, racial equality remains an elusive goal.) These findings are based on a national survey by Pew Research Center conducted Feb. 29-May 8, 2016, among 3,769 adults (including 1,799 whites, 1,004 blacks and 654 Hispanics).2 The survey – and the analysis of the survey findings – is centered primarily around the divide between blacks and whites and on the treatment of black people in the U.S. today. In recent years, this centuries-old divide has garnered renewed attention following the deaths of unarmed black Americans during encounters with the police, as well as a racially motivated shooting that killed nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\nThe survey finds that black and white adults have widely different perceptions about what life is like for blacks in the U.S. For example, by large margins, blacks are more likely than whites to say black people are treated less fairly in the workplace (a difference of 42 percentage points), when applying for a loan or mortgage (41 points), in dealing with the police (34 points), in the courts (32 points), in stores or restaurants (28 points), and when voting in elections (23 points). By a margin of at least 20 percentage points, blacks are also more likely than whites to say racial discrimination (70% vs. 36%), lower quality schools (75% vs. 53%) and lack of jobs (66% vs. 45%) are major reasons that blacks may have a harder time getting ahead than whites.\nBlacks and whites also differ in their opinions about the best approach for improving race relations: Among whites, more than twice as many say that in order to improve race relations, it’s more important to focus on what different racial and ethnic groups have in common (57%) as say the focus should be on what makes each group unique (26%). Among blacks, similar shares say the focus should be on commonalities (45%) as say it should be on differences (44%).\nWhen asked specifically about the impact President Barack Obama has had on race relations in the U.S., a majority of Americans give the president credit for at least trying to make things better, but a quarter say he has made race relations worse. Blacks and whites differ significantly in their assessments. Some 51% of blacks say Obama has made progress toward improving race relations, and an additional 34% say he has tried but failed to make progress. Relatively few blacks (5%) say Obama has made race relations worse, while 9% say he hasn’t addressed the issue at all.\nWhen asked about their views of Black Lives Matter, the activist movement that first came to national prominence following the 2014 shooting death of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, roughly two-thirds (65%) of blacks express support, including 41% who strongly support it. Among whites, four-in-ten say they support the Black Lives Movement at least somewhat, and this is particularly the case among white Democrats and those younger than 30.\nAnd while about eight-in-ten (78%) white Democrats say the country needs to continue making changes to achieve racial equality between whites and blacks, just 36% of white Republicans agree; 54% of white Republicans believe the country has already made the changes necessary for blacks to have equal rights with whites.\nHow blacks an\nDoc 2(Title: tive clemency in American history. After Ford’s pardon of Nixon, his approval rating fell over twenty points in the ensuing days. Many political analysts conclude that Ford never recovered from the pardon, thus severely damaging his chances to win election to the White House in 1976.8 Ford explained that he granted the pardon as an act of mercy to Nixon and for the broader purpose of restoring domestic tranquility in the nation after Watergate.9) Although some pardons are controversial, executive grants of clemency are not rare in American history. In fact, most clemency cases are “all but anonymous.”10 According to Department of Justice statistics, the total number of executive clemency actions from 1900 to 2017 is 22,485. In recent decades, the number of issued clemency grants have declined as well as the percentage of granted petitions.11 From the beginning of Ronald Reagan’s administration (1981) to the conclusion of Barack Obama’s presidency (2017), there have been 3,069 acts of executive clemency. There is also considerable variation amongst presidents. Since the mid-twentieth century, Barack Obama issued the most pardons and commutations (1,927) for two-term presidents. In comparison, George W. Bush issued the fewest number of clemency actions (200) for a two-term president.12\nThe Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice issues guidelines for the application of clemency, but presidents do not need to follow them.13 The Pardon Attorney serves in an advisory, not decision making, capacity. Recommendations for pardons are routed through the Deputy Attorney General, who supervises the Pardon Attorney.14 Final recommendations are made to the Office of White House Counsel, who advises the president on such petitions.15\nAs decided in Ex Parte Garland (1866), presidents may issue pardons at any time after the commission of a federal offense, even before federal charges have been filed or a sentence has been imposed.16 Such was the case when Ford pardoned Nixon. There are other instances of presidents circumventing judicial processes in anticipation of legal action. Abraham Lincoln issued preemptive pardons during the Civil War and so did Jimmy Carter, who pardoned Vietnam draft evaders who had not been charged for their actions.\nIt is unclear whether accepting a pardon is a legal admission of guilt. President Gerald Ford argued as such; he carried with him a quote from the Burdick v. United States (1915) decision that concluded a pardon “carries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it.” However, such statement was included in dicta, or legal commentary found within a judicial opinion that does not establish precedent. Other presidents have not shared Ford’s belief that a pardon’s acceptance signified guilt. For example, President George H.W. Bush pardoned former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and others involved in the Iran-Contra scandal because he felt they were innocent of wrongdoing; he claimed such individuals had fallen victim to “the criminalization of policy differences” and used the pardon power to correct legal judgments and prevent other errors from occurring.17\nLegal analysts are not settled on the question concerning the ability of a president to self-pardon. A recent review of law school faculty opinion on the power to self-pardon stated: “There is no clear consensus among legal professionals concerning the constitutionality of the presidential self-pardon, which has never been attempted by a U.S. President.”18 Some constitutional scholars argue that the Constitution does not explicitly prevent such an action, given the minimal restrictions placed on the pardon power in Article II. Other experts contend that a president cannot pardon himself or herself due to the established legal precedent that no one may be a judge in his own case and the constitutional restriction that a president cannot issue a pardon in relation to impeachment. Richard Nixon did consider a self-pardon in\nDoc 3(Title: nd donor bases but can also drive the perception that the election is theirs to lose.) What our modern-day two-term presidents can tell us\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were all reelected for vastly different reasons. What matters is that they all won second terms. It's also worth pointing out, as we look to 2020, that they all beat opponents who were not particularly strong candidates.\nOur modern two-term trio also suggests another reality of presidential politics: Even as our politics at the congressional level and in the media reflect severe polarization, volatility and partisanship, it may well be that Americans look to the presidency as a kind of port in the storm, a stable refuge from the uncertainty and chaos of our otherwise dysfunctional politics.\nDespite taking a battering over the years, especially during the 1960s and 1970s, the office of presidency still represents what's left of our affinity and allegiance to national symbols and values embodied in an office and in an individual -- the only elected official whom we can all vote for. Whether it's Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, Bush with his megaphone at Ground Zero or Obama in the wake of the Charleston shootings, we look to our presidents to lead, console, inspire and guide us through trauma and crisis.\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were nowhere near achieving undeniable greatness in the presidency. Indeed, they were all flawed and imperfect leaders. Still, when considering a second term, Americans seemed willing to forgive their flaws, favor their strengths over their liabilities and make allowances for their transgressions.\nWhether it's risk-aversion, inertia or any number of rationalizations among voters for not making a change midstream, the last quarter-century has demonstrated a remarkable stability in the presidency.\nSo what does this stability -- unseen for over two centuries -- say about the prospects for a fourth consecutive two-termer? The whole idea of making predictions a year-plus before an election is perilous -- even during ordinary times. And we are not living in anything remotely resembling ordinary times.\nThe power of Trump's incumbency is uncharted territory\nAs an incumbent, Trump carries unprecedented advantages. A strong economy and a nation secure from foreign threats extricating itself from foreign wars adds to that advantage. But what of the idea of the presidency as a source of stability, continuity and unity -- a place of leadership in tune with the best of America's norms and values?\nWhatever their failings -- and there were many, particularly Clinton's behavior with a presidential intern -- Donald Trump's three predecessors saw the office of the presidency as something greater than themselves, a national trust of sorts. They too encountered much of the partisanship and climate of conspiracy that helped fuel Trump's rise. But they never exploited it as a strategy and governing principle; and never departed -- certainly never as egregiously and selfishly as Trump has -- from their role as unifiers and custodians of the values of the office.\nIf the presidency remains a source of comfort and stability, a place of unity and a high ground for Americans despite all that divides them, Trump has brought precisely the opposite to the office: disruption, disrespect and the delegitimization of longstanding values and norms that have defined the presidency's resilience over the years.\nWill Trump become the first fourth-consecutive two-term president in American history? The answer may well depend on whether enough Americans still value the office of the presidency -- and whether they demand from its occupant a respect for the standards and integrity that generations of Americans have come to expect from their presidents.\nDoc 4(Title: hat the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker,” Justice Hugo Black said in his majority opinion.) It was Justice Robert Jackson’s concurring opinion that stated a three-part test of presidential powers that has since been used in arguments involving the executive’s overreach of powers.\nJackson said the President’s powers were at their height when he had the direct or implied authorization from Congress to act; at their middle ground – the Zone of Twilight, as he put it, when it was unsure which branch could act; and at their “lowest ebb” when a President acted against the expressed wishes of Congress.\nThe use of executive orders also played a key role in the Civil Rights movement. In 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower used an executive order to put the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and to enforce desegregation in Little Rock. Affirmative action and equal employment opportunity actions were also taken by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson using executive orders.\nPresident Roosevelt issued the most executive orders, according to records at the National Archives. He issued 3,728 orders between 1933 and 1945, as the country dealt with the Great Depression and World War II.\nPresident Truman issued a robust 896 executive orders over almost eight years in office. President Barack Obama issued 277 orders during his presidency. His predecessor, President George W. Bush, issued 291 orders over eight years, while President Bill Clinton had 364 executive orders during his two terms in office.\nThe most-active President in the post-World War II era, in terms of executive orders, was Jimmy Carter, who averaged 80 orders per year during his four-year term.\nDoc 5(Title: Remarks by the President in Conversation on Poverty at Georgetown University) Georgetown University\nWashington, D.C.\n11:39 A.M. EDT\nMR. DIONNE: It's a real honor to be here today with my two Presidents -- President Obama and President DeGioia. (Laughter.) And my friend, David Brooks, hurled the most vicious insult at me ever once when he said that I was the only person he ever met whose eyes lit up at the words, “panel discussion.” (Laughter.) And I have to confess my eyes did light up when I was asked to do this particular panel discussion -- and not just for the obvious reason, to my left -- and, again, it's a real honor to be with you, Mr. President -- or Arthur or Bob.\nPoverty is a subject we talk about mainly when tragic events, such as those we witnessed recently in Baltimore, grab our attention. Then we push it aside; we bury it; we say it's not politically shrewd to talk about it. So I salute Georgetown, my friend John Carr and Galen Carey, and all the other extraordinary people who are gathered here for the poverty summit from all religious traditions all over the country.\nOur friend, Jim Wallis, once said that if you cut everything Jesus said about the poor out of the Gospel you have a book full of holes. And these are evangelicals, Catholics and others who understand what the Scripture said.\nJust two quick organizing points on our discussion. The first is that when it's time to go, please keep your seat so the President can be escorted out. The other is that Bob and Arthur and I all agreed that we should direct somewhat more attention to President Obama than to the other members of the panel. (Laughter.) I just say that -- I say that in advance so that you know this was our call and not some exercise in executive power. (Laughter.) This was our decision to do this. (Applause.)\nAnd in any event, we hope this will be a back-and-forth kind of discussion. Bob and Arthur, feel free to interrupt the President if you feel like it. (Laughter.)\nMy first question, Mr. President, is the obvious one. A friend of mine said yesterday, when do Presidents do panels? And what came to mind is the late Admiral Stockdale, “Who am I? Why am I here?” (Laughter.) And I'd like to ask you why you decided -- this is a very unusual venue for a President to put himself in -- and I'd like to ask you where do you hope this discussion will lead beyond today?\nAnd I was struck with something you said in your speech last week. You said, politicians talk about poverty and inequality, and then gut policies that help alleviate poverty and reverse inequality. Why are you doing this, and how do you want us to come out of here?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I want to thank President DeGioia, the Georgetown community, all the groups -- nonprofits, faith-based groups and others -- who are hosting this today. And I want to thank this terrific panel.\nI think that we are at a moment -- in part because of what’s happened in Baltimore and Ferguson and other places, but in part because a growing awareness of inequality in our society -- where it may be possible not only to refocus attention on the issue of poverty, but also maybe to bridge some of the gaps that have existed and the ideological divides that have prevented us from making progress.\nAnd there are a lot of folks here who I have worked with -- they disagree with me on some issues, but they have great sincerity when it comes to wanting to deal with helping the least of these. And so this is a wonderful occasion for us to join together.\nPart of the reason I thought this venue would be useful and I wanted to have a dialogue with Bob and Arthur is that we have been stuck, I think for a long time, in a debate that creates a couple of straw men. The stereotype is that you’ve got folks on the left who just want to pour more money into social programs, and don't care anything about culture or parenting or family structures, and that's one stereotype.

Does any of this suggest that under-counting Republican voters in polling is acceptable?\nNo. This analysis finds that polls about public opinion on issues can be useful and valid, even if the poll overstates or understates a presidential candidate’s level of support by margins seen in the 2020 election. But this does not mean that pollsters should quit striving to have their surveys accurately represent Republican, Democratic and other viewpoints. Errors in the partisan composition of polls can go in both directions. As recently as 2012, election polls slightly underestimated Barack Obama’s support.\nDespite cautions from those inside and outside the profession, polling will continue to be judged, fairly or not, on the performance of preelection polls. A continuation of the recent underestimation of GOP electoral support would certainly do further damage to the field’s reputation. More fundamentally, the goal of the public opinion research community is to represent the public’s views, and anything within the profession’s control that threatens that goal should be remedied, even if the consequences for estimates on topics other than election outcomes are small. Pew Research Center is exploring ways to ensure we reach the correct share of Republicans and that they are comfortable taking our surveys. We are also trying to continuously evaluate whether Republicans and Trump voters – or indeed, Democrats and Biden voters – in our samples are fully representative of those in the population.\nLimitations of this analysis\nOne strength of this analysis is that the election is over, and it’s not necessary to guess at what Trump support ought to have been in these surveys. And by using respondents’ self-reported vote choice measured after the election, we avoid complications from respondents who may have changed their minds between taking the survey and casting their ballot.\nHowever, this study is not without its limitations. It’s based on polls conducted by only one organization, Pew Research Center, and these polls are national in scope, unlike many election polls that focused on individual states. The underlying mechanism that weakens the association between levels of candidate support (or party affiliation) and opinions on issues should apply to polls conducted by any organization at any level of geography, but we examined it using only our surveys.\nAnother important assumption is that the Trump voters and Biden voters who agreed to be interviewed are representative of Trump voters and Biden voters nationwide with respect to their opinions on issues. We cannot know that for sure.\nDoc 3(Title: dance on a variety of assessments that promote historical thinking and active learning.) Review, Evaluation and Supplementary Materials. Prior to publication, history textbooks should be reviewed and evaluated by research historians and active teachers. In other words, the composition of textbooks should involve the participation of leading scholars and of the teachers, community college instructors, and public historians who will most likely assign and rely on these textbooks. Once adopted, textbooks should be regularly evaluated, revised and updated for their effectiveness.\nWhen possible, textbooks should also offer different types of supplementary materials in both print and digital formats. Textbooks should also be evaluated in terms of their adaptability in various school settings and should be adaptable to schools with very different resource levels. Offering a wide range of supplementary materials, in both print and digital formats, can help overcome the disparity in resource levels.\nHistory textbooks play a very important role in history education. They should help prepare students to develop the historical knowledge and the skills necessary to interpret the past with clarity, empathy, imagination and rigor. Recognizing that textbooks will vary widely depending on a number of different factors, including educational level, the breadth of the course, and authors’ tastes and approaches, history textbooks should reflect current scholarships, be peer reviewed and adhere to scholarly standards.\nDoc 4(Title: eace.) [13] During sixteen long months this assault has blotted out the whole pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations, great and small. And the assailants are still on the march, threatening other nations, great and small.\n[14]Therefore, as your President, performing my constitutional duty to “give to the Congress information of the state of the Union,” I find it, unhappily, necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our borders.\n[15] Armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents. If that defense fails, all the population and all the resources of Europe, and Asia, and Africa and Australasia will be dominated by conquerors. And let us remember that the total of those populations in those four continents, the total of those populations and their resources greatly exceeds the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere–yes, many times over.\n[16] In times like these it is immature–and incidentally, untrue–for anybody to brag that an unprepared America, single-handed, and with one hand tied behind its back, can hold off the whole world.\n[17] No realistic American can expect from a dictator’s peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion–or even good business.\n[18] Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. “Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.”\n[19] As a nation, we may take pride in the fact that we are softhearted; but we cannot afford to be soft-headed.\n[20] We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal preach the “ism” of appeasement.\n[21] We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests.\n[22] I have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this war.\n[23] There is much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the seas. Obviously, as long as the British Navy retains its power, no such danger exists. Even if there were no British Navy, it is not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack us by landing troops in the United States from across thousands of miles of ocean, until it had acquired strategic bases from which to operate.\n[24] But we learn much from the lessons of the past years in Europe-particularly the lesson of Norway, whose essential seaports were captured by treachery and surprise built up over a series of years.\n[25] The first phase of the invasion of this Hemisphere would not be the landing of regular troops. The necessary strategic points would be occupied by secret agents and by their dupes- and great numbers of them are already here, and in Latin America.\n[26] As long as the aggressor nations maintain the offensive, they-not we–will choose the time and the place and the method of their attack.\n[27] And that is why the future of all the American Republics is today in serious danger.\n[28] That is why this Annual Message to the Congress is unique in our history.\n[29] That is why every member of the Executive Branch of the Government and every member of the Congress face great responsibility and great accountability.\n[30] The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily–almost exclusively–to meeting this foreign peril.

In the balanced version, 54% said that it was a bigger problem for the country that people did not see racism that was occurring, compared with 57% among the tilted version. Similarly, in the balanced version, 38% said that the U.S. had controlled the coronavirus outbreak “as much as it could have,” compared with 35% who said this in the tilted version. All other questions tested showed smaller differences.) Opinion questions on issues that have been at the core of partisan divisions in U.S. politics tended to be the only ones that showed any difference between the balanced version and the tilted version. Preference for smaller versus bigger government, a fundamental dividing line between the parties, differed by 2 points between the versions. Perceptions of the impact of immigration on the country, a core issue for Donald Trump, also varied by 2 points between the two versions. The belief that human activity contributes “a great deal” to global climate change was 2 points higher in the tilted version. The share of Americans saying that government should do more to help the needy was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version.\nDespite the fact that news audiences are quite polarized politically, there were typically only small differences between the two versions in how many people have been relying on particular sources for news in the aftermath of the presidential election.

A minority of people who support each candidate do not hold views that are consistent with what their candidate or party favors. Among nonvoters, support among partisans for their party’s traditional positions – especially among Republicans – is even weaker. This fact lessens the impact of changing the balance of candidate support and party affiliation in a poll.\nThere’s almost never a one-to-one correspondence between the share of voters for a candidate and the share of people holding a particular opinion that aligns with the opinion of that candidate’s party. Three examples from a summer 2020 survey illustrate the point.\nAsked whether they favor a larger government providing more services or a smaller government providing fewer services, nearly one-fourth of Biden’s supporters (23%) opted for smaller government, a position not usually associated with Democrats or Democratic candidates. On a question about whether the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens American values or strengthens its society, nearly one-third of Trump’s supporters (31%) take the pro-immigrant view, despite the fact that the Trump administration took a number of steps to limit both legal and illegal immigration. And about one-fourth of Trump’s supporters (24%) say that it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, hardly a standard Republican Party position.\nShifting the focus to party affiliation among nonvoters, we see even less fidelity of partisans to issue positions typically associated with those parties.

If you read the writings of real anarchists like Mikhail Bakunin, (who also warned us about the potential for “Red Terror” and an oppressive, pseudo “People’s state” Marxism would bring) James Guillaume, Nestor Makhno, Kropotkin, Camillo Berneri, Emma Goldman, and Adhémar Schwitzguébel, you will see they say there is no anarchy without abolishing wage slavery and freeing ourselves from our economic masters who have far more power than politicians. Anarchism evolved in tandem with many revoluntionary, socialist movements and that is the reason.) Why do ancaps believe market competition is the solution to everything? The more competition there is in the marketplace, the more incentive there is for lower wages, worse working conditions, more unethical practices, and so on as it becomes harder and harder to make a profit. Not everything in this world should have a price tag! I don’t know why that’s not obvious to everyone. Cooperation, collaboration, and collective ownership are much more conducive to productivity, innovation, and well-being in our economic, social, and environmental spheres. This doesn’t mean we should revert to communism. Due to Western propaganda, much of the West believes there is some dichotomy between capitalism and communism. But that is absurd. There are an infinite number of ways economies can run that are a far cry from either system. Communism involves the state (taking over that power and using it) and we have seen the disasterous dictatorships like the Soviet Union who have used “communism” as a justification for their despotism. Barter, resource based economies, gift economies, and cryptocurrencies work infinitely better. Elements of libertarian socialism (NOT state socialism) are also useful as they promote collective ownership of the means of production and distribution by need, as opposed to greed.\nPoliticians are just figure heads or puppets for the super rich. The people with the real power are the super rich like the Rothschilds who print money that they then lend to the government, so that the people are perpetually “in debt” to them. The regulations sensible people want on corporations don’t impede “mom and pop” small businesses. These regulations target the exploitative and ecocidal practices of mutlibillion dollar corporations. The only reason anyone should not want those regulations is because they profit from these corporations or they aspire to. And these types of regulations don’t require governments to enforce them so there’s nothing statist about wanting to reign in these massive, destructive corporations. These corporations would be put in check without governments. The starving populace wouldn’t put up with billionaires and their ridiculous bourgeois lifestyles if it wasn’t illegal to take their ill-gotten riches. To think less government regulations on corporations are the answer to our woes is beyond naive; It is incredibly dangerous. The banks robbed our economy and the American government bailed them out with $700 billion of taxpayer money. Corporations and governments are in b\nDoc 2(Title:  away and given to the rich. The rich have gotten richer faster than the poor have moved up. And we might be concerned with that because that also reflects on opportunity. And as an opportunity society, as an equal opportunity society, we should all be really concerned with that.) But the extent that we can get away from this notion that the rich are stealing from the poor, then we can look at this in I think in a way that's constructive. Why? Because the rich are our neighbors and the poor are our neighbors, and everybody else should be our neighbors and they're all our kids. And I think getting away from that rhetoric is really important.\nAnd then the last point, actually, as we come to consensus is remembering that capitalism or socialism or social democracy or any system is just a system. Look, it’s just a system. It’s just a machine. It’s like your car. You can do great good with it, you can do great evil with it. It can't go uninhibited. So far it can't drive on its own. It will soon enough. The economy never will be able to.\nCapitalism is nothing more than a system, and it must be predicated on right morals. It must be. Adam Smith taught me that. Adam Smith, the father of modern economics -- he wrote “The Wealth of Nations,” in 1776 -- 17 years before he wrote “The Theory of Moral sentiments,” which was a more important book because it talked about what it meant as a society to earn the right to have free enterprise, to have free economics. And it was true then, and it’s still true today.\nSo this is why this conference is so important. This conversation with the President of the United States is so important, from my point of view -- I say with appropriate humility -- is because we're talking about right morality toward our brothers and sisters, and built on that, that's when we can have an open discussion to get our capitalism right. And then the distribution of resources is only a tertiary question. (Applause.)\nMR. DIONNE: I still want to know how much infrastructure you're actually willing to vote for, but I’ll take --\nMR. BROOKS: $41 billion.\nMR. DIONNE: All right, it’s a start. We can negotiate.\nI want to -- this is in a way for both the President and Bob, because in this conversation about poverty, there’s kind of consensus on this stage that, yes, you need to care about family structure, it really matters, but if you don't worry about the economy, you're not sort of thinking about why the battering ram is against the family.\nAnd yet, this family conversation can make a lot of people feel uneasy because it sounds like either you're not taking politics seriously, or you're not taking the real economic pressure seriously. And I just want to share two things with the President and Bob, and have you respond.\nOne, as you can imagine, I asked a lot of smart people what they would ask about if they were in my position. And one very smart economist said, look, what we know is when we have really tight labor markets, unemployment down below -- down to 4 or even lower -- Kennedy, Johnson years, World War II, at the end of the Clinton years -- all kinds of good things start happening to poor people. So maybe, this person said, even though, he says, yes, family structure matters, let’s stop with the moral lectures and just run a really tight economic policy, and we could have some really good things happen to us.\nAnd then the other thing I wanted to share -- and I’m being pointed here, Mr. President, because you know and I’ve heard you talk about this, but not that often publicly, which is -- you know, I’ve heard you in those sessions you do with opinion reporters -- Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote something back in 2013 about your talk about what needs to happen inside the African American community -- I know you remember this: “Taking full measure of the Obama presidency thus far, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this White House has one way of addressing the social ills that afflict black people and particularly black youth, \nDoc 3(Title: Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand how the public views socialism and capitalism. For this analysis, we surveyed 7,647 adults from Aug. 1-14, 2022. The survey was primarily conducted on the Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel, with an oversample of Hispanic adults from Ipsos’ KnowledgePanel.) Respondents on both panels are recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. See the Methodology section for additional details. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.\nHere are the questions used for the report and its methodology.\nThe American public continues to express more positive opinions of “capitalism” than “socialism,” although the shares viewing each of the terms positively have declined modestly since 2019.\nToday, 36% of U.S. adults say they view socialism somewhat (30%) or very (6%) positively, down from 42% who viewed the term positively in May 2019. Six-in-ten today say they view socialism negatively, including one-third who view it very negatively.\nAnd while a majority of the public (57%) continues to view capitalism favorably, that is 8 percentage points lower than in 2019 (65%), according to a national survey from Pew Research Center conducted Aug. 1-14 among 7,647 adults.\nMuch of the decline in positive views of both socialism and capitalism has been driven by shifts in views among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.\nIn 2019, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic leaners (65%) had a positive view of socialism. Today a smaller majority of Democrats (57%) say they have a positive impression.\nThere has not been significant change among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents since 2019. Today, just 14% say they have a positive impression of socialism, while about four times as many say they have a very negative view of the term.\nThere is a similar pattern on views of capitalism. Today, fewer than half of Democrats (46%) have a positive view of capitalism, down 9 points from the 55% who said this in 2019.\nAmong Republicans, there has been a modest decline in the share who have positive views of capitalism, although a large majority still have a positive impression (78% in 2019, 74% today).\nAmericans see capitalism as giving people more opportunity and more freedom than socialism, while they see socialism as more likely to meet people’s basic needs, though these perceptions differ significantly by party.\nWhile 36% of adults say “gives all people an equal opportunity to be successful” describes capitalism extremely or very well, fewer (23%) say that about socialism. And roughly twice as many say the phrase “makes sure everyone’s basic needs, such as food, health care, and housing, are met” describes socialism at least very well as say the same of capitalism (38% vs. 18%).\nConsistent with the wide partisan differences in opinions of socialism and capitalism, Republicans and Democrats characterize the terms in very different ways. For example, Republicans widely think socialism “restricts people’s individual freedoms” – 62% say this describes socialism extremely or very well, compared with 19% of Democrats. Democrats, by contrast, are far more likely than Republicans to say socialism meets people’s basic needs (56% extremely or very well vs. 19% of Republicans).\nThese differences echo findings from Americans’ open-ended descriptions of the terms in the 2019 study, which found that critics of socialism were more likely to mention stifled innovation and restrictions of freedom in their responses and to cite countries like Venezuela as examples. Those with a positive view of socialism were more likely to describe it as a fairer system – and to mention countries like Finland and Denmark as examples.\nDemocrats and Republicans \nDoc 4(Title: thoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement.

They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.) Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, \"If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States.\" I think that's exactly what he will do.\nBut as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died, because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.\nNow it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the, or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\nOur Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men - that we're to choose just between two personalities.\nWell what of this man that they would destroy, and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him \"when.\" I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.\nThis is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.\nAn ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, \"Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such,\" and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.\nDuring the hecti\nDoc 5(Title:  of Afghanistan and Iraq by bombing them back to the Stone Age. Put freedom, liberty, patriotism, and other political buzz words on whatever you’re trying to sell and gullible people will buy it without a taking a second to even consider what they are actually being sold. As John Steinbeck (or Ronald Wright) said (it’s a disputed quote), “Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.” People seem to be okay being slaves so long as they believe there is a chance they can become slave owners if they “work hard enough” but it’s not true. You can work as hard as you want but if you weren’t afforded major advantages like a large inheritance or a father with a monopoly, you will likely never become one of those masters. People have to stop wanting to be a part of the bourgeoisie 1% we are supposed to be fighting. If you read the writings of real anarchists like Mikhail Bakunin, (who also warned us about the potential for “Red Terror” and an oppressive, pseudo “People’s state” Marxism would bring) James Guillaume, Nestor Makhno, Kropotkin, Camillo Berneri, Emma Goldman, and Adhémar Schwitzguébel, you will see they say there is no anarchy without abolishing wage slavery and freeing ourselves from our economic masters who have far more power than politicians. Anarchism evolved in tandem with many revoluntionary, socialist movements and that is the reason.) Why do ancaps believe market competition is the solution to everything? The more competition there is in the marketplace, the more incentive there is for lower wages, worse working conditions, more unethical practices, and so on as it becomes harder and harder to make a profit. Not everything in this world should have a price tag! I don’t know why that’s not obvious to everyone. Cooperation, collaboration, and collective ownership are much more conducive to productivity, innovation, and well-being in our economic, social, and environmental spheres. This doesn’t mean we should revert to communism. Due to Western propaganda, much of the West believes there is some dichotomy between capitalism and communism. But that is absurd. There are an infinite number of ways economies can run that are a far cry from either system. Communism involves the state (taking over that power and using it) and we have seen the disasterous dictatorships like the Soviet Union who have used “communism” as a justification for their despotism. Barter, resource based economies, gift economies, and cryptocurrencies work infinitely better. Elements of libertarian socialism (NOT state socialism) are also useful as they promote collective ownership of the means of production and distribution by need, as opposed to greed.\nPoliticians are just figure heads or puppets for the super rich. The people with the real power are the super rich like the Rothschilds who print money that they then lend to the government, so that the people are perpetually “in debt” to them. The regulations sensible people want on corporations don’t impede “mom and pop” small businesses. These regulations target the exploitative and ecocidal practices of mutlibillion dollar corporations. The only reason anyone should not want those regulations is because they profit from these corporations or they aspire to. And these types of regulations don’t require governments to enforce them so there’s nothing statist about wanting to reign in these massive, destructive corporations. These corporations would be put in check without governments. The starving populace wouldn’t put up with billionaires and their ridiculous bourgeois lifestyles if it wasn’t illegal to take their ill-gotten riches. To think less government regulations on corporations are the answer to our woes is beyond naive; It is incredibly dangerous. The banks robbed our economy and the American government bailed them out with $700 billion of taxpayer money.

Good textbooks, educators and researchers increasingly argue, offer cohesion and structure where internet-sourced curricula fall short.\nYour content has been saved!\nGo to My Saved Content.Dana Croy of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, wishes her 10th-grade daughter had more textbooks. Homework and test review involve photocopied texts and worksheet packets that aren’t clearly connected to a source, and it’s hard to make sense of the work at home. The two textbooks she did get this year—for health and English class—have never been opened; teachers don’t seem to use them. In other classes, like biology and social studies, assigned reading is digital and accessed via Chromebook laptops that must stay at school.\n“She’s struggling in her classes, and I’m at a loss at how to help,” said Croy. “She’s coming home with biology homework; there’s not even any reference material. I asked her, ‘Where do you find these answers? Are you googling them?’”\nTraditional textbooks come with a host of issues: They’re expensive, quickly outdated, and, according to recent research, may offer biased or limited viewpoints. There’s also pedagogical baggage: Some argue that textbooks can become a crutch, rigidly limiting teachers’ ability to branch out and create a rich learning experience with primary documents and other resources. Researchers say textbook usage varies greatly from district to district, between schools, and even between classrooms in the same school. About 60 percent of teachers say they still use district-adopted textbooks as “one resource among many,” according to data from the Brookings Institution, but the vast majority also look elsewhere for materials, usually online.\nThe ambiguity around the value of textbooks, as well as the enormous cost of keeping up-to-date collections in schools, means that districts often don’t buy them. Or they continue to allocate funds for textbooks (paper or digital) but discourage educators from using them, leaving educators to create their own materials from an assortment of online resources. But the vast online marketplace for educational materials—with digital worksheets, projects, and assessments available for download for free or for a few dollars—comes with its own serious concerns around quality and reliability. “With a few clicks of the keyboard, a teacher can find a worksheet to practice addition and subtraction, a frog dissection kit for a biology lab, and quizzes and answer keys for all five acts of Romeo and Juliet,” write Amber Northern, senior vice president for research at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, and Morgan Polikoff, an associate professor at USC’s Rossier School of Education for ASCD. “Yet we know almost nothing about the quality of such supplementary materials.”\nMeanwhile, a growing chorus of researchers and educators assert that, in addition to embracing evidence-based reading instruction, it’s time to examine the benefits of high-quality curricula such as textbooks across all subject areas. Now, 14 states are prioritizing the adoption of evidence-based learning materials like textbooks, arguing that PowerPoint slides and lessons gathered from the internet are easy to obtain but are often low-quality. “Curriculum is a critical factor in student academic success,” writes David Steiner in a 2017 report for the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy. “The cumulative impact of high-quality curriculum can be significant and matters most to achievement in the upper grades where typical year-on-year learning gains are far lower than in previous grades.”\nTextbook skepticism\nWhen Cathy Schechter began teaching fourth grade in the Bay Area 29 years ago, she said it had been “drilled into her head” in teacher training—and later supported by district leaders—that teachers who used textbooks were “boring.” Schechter dutifully ignored the textbooks supplied by the state, spending extra evening and weekend hours putting together projects and lesso\nDoc 2(Title: dance on a variety of assessments that promote historical thinking and active learning.) Review, Evaluation and Supplementary Materials. Prior to publication, history textbooks should be reviewed and evaluated by research historians and active teachers. In other words, the composition of textbooks should involve the participation of leading scholars and of the teachers, community college instructors, and public historians who will most likely assign and rely on these textbooks. Once adopted, textbooks should be regularly evaluated, revised and updated for their effectiveness.\nWhen possible, textbooks should also offer different types of supplementary materials in both print and digital formats. Textbooks should also be evaluated in terms of their adaptability in various school settings and should be adaptable to schools with very different resource levels. Offering a wide range of supplementary materials, in both print and digital formats, can help overcome the disparity in resource levels.\nHistory textbooks play a very important role in history education. They should help prepare students to develop the historical knowledge and the skills necessary to interpret the past with clarity, empathy, imagination and rigor. Recognizing that textbooks will vary widely depending on a number of different factors, including educational level, the breadth of the course, and authors’ tastes and approaches, history textbooks should reflect current scholarships, be peer reviewed and adhere to scholarly standards.\nDoc 3(Title: Approved by Council in June 1997; updated June 2018.) Textbooks play a vital role in history education, from elementary school through the college survey courses. In addition to addressing a variety of themes, topics, and educational levels, textbooks also appropriately reflect authors’ particular tastes and approaches. While textbooks inevitably and rightly reflect authors’ particular approaches and interpretive choices, one can identify certain general qualities that textbooks should possess. Recognizing that textbooks will vary widely depending on a number of different factors, including the educational level of the intended audience, the breadth of the course, and authors’ approaches, all students who encounter history textbooks are entitled to works that meets professional standards.\nIn order to promote high quality history education, the AHA encourages those who are evaluating textbooks for possible adoption to consider the following questions.\nGood history textbooks offer a distillation of available knowledge on major subjects in the discipline, while providing other exercises geared to the appropriate student level. Good textbooks can and should vary considerably for any given grade level and for any survey subject. Depending on the course, some textbooks will offer broad coverage, while others will emphasize more in-depth coverage.\nIt is important that teachers have choice in the particular approaches presented and that they be involved in the process of textbook selection. Teachers bring essential knowledge and experience to textbook decisions and should be given the opportunity to pick among several options according to personal preference, course goals, and their special understanding of the students they serve.\nWhile a variety of approaches among textbooks is desirable, satisfactory texts at every level meet certain criteria. The most important guideline, from which more specific criteria follow, is the need to make sure that the text contributes to good history instruction and adheres to scholarly standards.\nFactual Coverage. History textbooks convey historical facts. No matter what the subject or how large the book, historians are selective about which historical facts to include. A satisfactory history text describes what the key selection criteria have been so that users can assess the validity of the choices and also have an awareness of the potential gaps. For example, a world history text may place less emphasis on certain early periods or geographical regions and still measure up to coverage needs, but the choices should be briefly indicated and explained. In U.S. history, some sequences of presidents are often summed up without great detail in an effort to discuss the broader social and political trends that characterize the era in question. Again, this kind of selectivity should be briefly noted and explained. In addition to explaining selectivity in coverage, good textbooks should also address the provisional nature of historical knowledge and explain gaps in our understanding of certain events.\nFactual coverage should reflect explicit attention to chronology and change over time. That is, it should help establish differences as well as similarities between past and present and should deal with events and patterns in a sequence of time. For more advanced students, chronology should also be presented through discussion of periodization, that is, through discussion of key points of change so that students can understand the interpretive choices involved in deciding on major breaks in chronology sequences.\nHistory textbooks should reflect current scholarship and be peer reviewed. Regular updating and revision in light of new historical research as well as research from the scholarship of teaching and learning are essential for textbook accuracy and balance. Wherever possible, a brief discussion of suggested supplementary readings, appropriate to the user level but reflective of the most recent historical re\nDoc 4(Title: s study (2017) of three Swedish teachers revealed that despite the differences between these teachers, the textbooks played, to a large degree, a similarly guiding role in their teaching.) It should be stressed that although issues of how textbooks are used by teachers and what role textbooks play in teachers’ teaching are closely related, they are not identical, as the former is in a sense neutral or value-free (e.g., regarding patterns of use), but the latter involves a further value judgement, especially when it comes to the issue of whether textbooks play a facilitation or hindrance role in teachers’ teaching. Nevertheless, in the previous literature, this value judgement was rarely examined.\nAs key teaching materials, textbooks are intended to be used in different stages of teaching. As Shulman (1987) pointed out: “The text may be a vehicle for the accomplishment of other educational purposes, but some sort of teaching material is almost always involved” (p. 14). According to Shulman, in general, teachers’ teaching is initiated by some form of ‘text’—a textbook or other teaching materials—and their pedagogical reasoning and actions for teaching involve a cycle through the activities of ‘comprehension’, ‘transformation’, ‘instruction’, ‘evaluation’, ‘reflection’ and ‘new comprehension’ (see more details below); moreover, educational materials (including textbooks) and structures “comprise both the tools of the trade and the contextual conditions that will either facilitate or inhibit teaching efforts” (p. 10, emphasis added). This aspect leads to the issue of whether textbooks facilitate or hinder the processes of teachers’ pedagogical reasoning and actions.\nThere are a few studies addressing, implicitly or explicitly, issues concerning the facilitating or hindering role of textbooks in the aforementioned processes of teachers’ teaching of mathematics. For example, focusing on ‘comprehension’, Ding et al. (2013) found that Chinese textbooks may help teachers to acquire directly the knowledge that ‘0 cannot be a divisor’, while Davis (2009) argued that the two US textbooks in his study generally had little effect on teachers’ understanding of exponent properties. Furthermore, an analysis of a popular set of textbooks for upper primary mathematics in Spain found that mathematics textbooks may become an obstacle when learning the topic of measure, since these textbooks show a very skewed approach to the teaching of this topic (Mengual et al., 2015).\nWith regard to ‘transformation’, it was reported that Canadian post-secondary teachers regarded textbooks as ‘good resources’ in sequencing and presenting the content as well as selecting exercises in their lesson planning (González-Martín et al., 2018). On the other hand, contrasting results about the role of textbooks (including teacher guides), as a facilitator or barrier, concerning teachers’ teaching methods were discovered (e.g., Davis, 2009; Matić & Gracin, 2021; Ulusoy & Incikabi, 2020). Based on the TIMSS Video Study criteria, Vincent and Stacey (2008) claimed that features of some best-selling Australian textbooks can be seen contributing to the low-procedural complexity, highly-repetitive, lack-of-reasoning mode of teaching, also known as ‘shallow teaching’.\nIn terms of ‘instruction’, it was reported that teachers’ use of examples of textbooks might help their students overcome difficulties (Davis, 2009; González-Martín et al., 2018) and engage in active knowledge organization (Prediger et al., 2021). Furthermore, regarding assessment or ‘evaluation’ in Shulman’s terms, some researchers found that textbooks provided problems and applications that were helpful (O’Keeffe & White, 2017) or not so helpful (Divrik et al., 2020) for teachers’ assessment and evaluation, and textbooks could also serve as a reference in teachers’ ‘reflection’ on their teaching, which was the case in a Shanghai teaching research group’s attempt to support a junior teacher’s professional learning (\nDoc 5(Title: What Role Do States Play in Selecting K-12 Textbooks?) A network of states move the needle on quality without usurping local control.\nHigh-quality K-12 instructional materials can meaningfully improve teaching practice and student achievement, especially when paired with professional learning support.[1] Yet state policymakers have usually left ultimate authority for textbook selection to school district leaders.[2] Consequently, the quality of materials across U.S. classrooms and within states varies, with potentially detrimental effects on student learning.\nYet a growing number of states have been creatively mixing policy, guidance, and supports to promote the use of high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) at the local level. Our own RAND American Teacher Panel survey data suggest that these strategies are working: Adoption of high-quality English language arts and mathematics instructional materials is higher among K-12 schools in those states, as are teachers’ reports that they use those materials regularly in their instruction.\nWhat Do Textbook Policies Look Like?\nState textbook adoption policies can be broadly divided into two categories: state adoption states and local adoption states.[3] In the 19 states with state policies, state-appointed boards are responsible for reviewing textbooks and creating lists of “adopted” or “approved” textbooks for districts to consider. In the remaining states, districts are largely left to shift for themselves based on their own criteria.[4]\nPolicy across the 19 state adoption states varies greatly. For example, in Tennessee, Rhode Island, and Nevada, districts must adopt state-approved textbooks or seek a waiver to use a nonapproved textbook. But in Texas and New Mexico, adoption lists are recommendations, not mandates.\nEven when districts adopt a textbook from a state-approved list, our research indicates that only a third of teachers use that textbook regularly with little or no modification.[5] More commonly, teachers heavily modify the textbooks they are provided, assembling lesson plans that draw from multiple textbooks or relying on lesson plans that they have created entirely by themselves. For states looking to increase the amount of actual classroom instruction driven by high-quality materials, influencing local adoption is only the first step.\nCreating Conditions for HQIM Use\nLouisiana was one of the first states to take a more assertive role to not only inform district textbook adoption but also pair adoptions with high-quality supports for teachers.[6] Beginning roughly in 2012, the Louisiana Department of Education began focusing on curriculum materials as central to the delivery of standards-aligned instruction. The department began to publish reviews of commonly used K-12 textbooks for math and English, with clear information about what was high quality and standards aligned and what was not. The department also made it easier for districts to adopt curriculum materials that reviewers hired under state contracts deemed as high quality. Staff also identified professional development vendors that explicitly focus on supporting implementation of designated high-quality materials, and they made sure that state and benchmark assessment tools were aligned with those materials.\nDrawing heavily upon the example of Louisiana, the Council of Chief State School Officers formed the High-Quality Instructional Materials and Professional Development (IMPD) Network in 2017. The network develops and shares strategies to increase adoption and use of HQIM. We have been studying those strategies since it formed. We group them into three categories: mandates, signals, and incentives.\nMandates. Certain states with state adoption policies enforce the use of state-selected instructional materials. While universal textbook mandates are rare, several states have recently mandated the adoption of approved materials in select grades and subjects—namely, reading instruction.

We try to address this not with sweeping predictions or grand theories, but with mathematical projections that combine techniques standardly used in demography (the study of human populations) with data we have collected in surveys on religion.) Demographers project the growth or shrinkage of populations based on factors such as age, sex, fertility, mortality and migration. For religious populations, projections also need to include data on “switching” – voluntary movement into and out of religious groups. Finally, the shifting sizes of U.S. religious groups depend partly on rates of religious transmission – whether parents pass their religious identity on to their children. In this report, Pew Research Center has incorporated estimates of “intergenerational transmission of religion” into our projections for the first time.\nSwitching rates are estimated based on responses from more than 15,000 adults to two questions posed in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey: “In what religion, if any, were you raised?” and “What is your present religion, if any?” Results were weighted to the Center’s National Public Opinion Reference Survey, conducted by mail and online in 2020. Long-term cohort trends in switching (going back to the 1970s) come from two similar questions in the long-running General Social Survey: “In what religion were you raised?” and “What is your religious preference?”\nShifts in religious identity, or switching, are concentrated among young adults. During earlier childhood years, a parent’s religion (or lack thereof) is often, but not always, transmitted to a child. Rates of transmission for three identity categories (Christian, other religion, and religiously unaffiliated) are estimated based on the percentages of teens (ages 13 to 17) who shared their mother’s religious affiliation in a 2019 survey of 1,811 pairs of U.S. parents and teens. These observed patterns are used to model whether future generations of newborn children inherit their mother’s religion.\nGroup differences in fertility (the number of children women tend to have), migration and age structures also drive change. Fertility differences by religion are based on the National Survey of Family Growth, while the average U.S. fertility rate used in each period is based on the 2019 revision of United Nations World Populations Prospect data. Migration data comes from the UN. Religious composition by age and sex groups is based on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel. We estimate the religious composition of children based on the religious composition of young adults, and fertility patterns.\nThe various input data is used in projection models to illustrate what the future religious composition of the U.S. might look like under a range of hypothetical scenarios. See Methodology for more information on inputs and modeling.\nSince the 1990s, large numbers of Americans have left Christianity to join the growing ranks of U.S. adults who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular.” This accelerating trend is reshaping the U.S. religious landscape, leading many people to wonder what the future of religion in America might look like.\nWhat if Christians keep leaving religion at the same rate observed in recent years? What if the pace of religious switching continues to accelerate? What if switching were to stop, but other demographic trends – such as migration, births and deaths – were to continue at current rates? To help answer such questions, Pew Research Center has modeled several hypothetical scenarios describing how the U.S. religious landscape might change over the next half century.\nThe Center estimates that in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones,” acc\nDoc 2(Title:  modeled several hypothetical scenarios describing how the U.S. religious landscape might change over the next half century.) The Center estimates that in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones,” accounted for 30% of the U.S. population. Adherents of all other religions – including Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists – totaled about 6%.1\nDepending on whether religious switching continues at recent rates, speeds up or stops entirely, the projections show Christians of all ages shrinking from 64% to between a little more than half (54%) and just above one-third (35%) of all Americans by 2070. Over that same period, “nones” would rise from the current 30% to somewhere between 34% and 52% of the U.S. population.\nSwitching, which in some cases could be described as religious conversion, is defined in this report as a change between the religion in which a person was raised (in childhood) and their present religious identity (in adulthood).\nCurrent rates of switching are based on responses from more than 15,000 adults to two questions posed in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey: “In what religion, if any, were you raised?” and “What is your present religion, if any?”\nIn many cases, switching does not happen in a single moment. Religious “nones” often describe their disaffiliation as a gradual process, and some may never have felt a strong connection to a religious identity, even though they describe themselves as having been raised in a faith tradition.\nHowever, these are not the only possibilities, and they are not meant as predictions of what will happen. Rather, this study presents formal demographic projections of what could happen under a few illustrative scenarios based on trends revealed by decades of survey data from Pew Research Center and the long-running General Social Survey.\nAll the projections start from the current religious composition of the U.S. population, taking account of religious differences by age and sex. Then, they factor in birth rates and migration patterns. Most importantly, they incorporate varying rates of religious switching – movement into and out of broad categories of religious identity – to model what the U.S. religious landscape would look like if switching stayed at its recent pace, continued to speed up (as it has been doing since the 1990s), or suddenly halted.\nSwitching rates are based on patterns observed in recent decades, through 2019. For example, we estimate that 31% of people raised Christian become unaffiliated between ages 15 to 29, the tumultuous period in which religious switching is concentrated.2 An additional 7% of people raised Christian become unaffiliated later in life, after the age of 30.\nWhile the scenarios in this report vary in the extent of religious disaffiliation they project, they all show Christians continuing to shrink as a share of the U.S. population, even under the counterfactual assumption that all switching came to a complete stop in 2020. At the same time, the unaffiliated are projected to grow under all four scenarios.\nUnder each of the four scenarios, people of non-Christian religions would grow to represent 12%-13% of the population – double their present share. This consistency does not imply more certainty or precision compared with projections for Christians and “nones.” Rather, the growth of other religions is likely to hinge on the future of migration (rather than religious switching), and migration patterns are held constant across all four scenarios. (See Chapter 2 for an alternative scenario involving migration.)\nOf course, it is possible that events outside the study’s model – such as war, economic depression, climate crisis, changing immigration patterns or religious innovations – could reverse current religious switching trends, leading to a revival of Christianity in the United States. But there are no current switching patterns in the U.S. that c\nDoc 3(Title: th taken over the last 50 years by many countries in Western Europe that had overwhelming Christian majorities in the middle of the 20th century and no longer do. In Great Britain, for example, “nones” surpassed Christians to become the largest group in 2009, according to the British Social Attitudes Survey.5 In the Netherlands, disaffiliation accelerated in the 1970s, and 47% of adults now say they are Christian.) While the change in affiliation rates in the United States is largely due to people voluntarily leaving religion behind, switching is not the only driver of religious composition change worldwide. For example, differences in fertility rates explain most of the recent religious change in India, while migration has altered the religious composition of many European countries in the last century. Forced conversions, mass expulsions, wars and genocides also have caused changes in religious composition throughout history.\nMoreover, the scenarios in this report are limited to religious identity and do not project how religious beliefs and practices might change in the coming decades.\nAlong with the decline in the percentage of U.S. adults who identify as Christian in recent years, Pew Research Center surveys have found declining shares of the population who say they pray daily or consider religion very important in their lives. Still, it is an open question whether the Christian population in the future will be more or less highly committed than U.S. Christians are today.\nOn the one hand, within each generation, Christians with lower levels of religious commitment may be most likely to shed their identity and become religiously unaffiliated, while new converts may bring greater zeal. These dynamics could lead to rising levels of commitment in the remaining Christian population. On the other hand, religious commitment could steadily weaken from generation to generation if people continue to identify as Christian but are less devout than their parents and grandparents. This dynamic could lead to steady or declining levels of belief and practice.\nMeanwhile, religiously unaffiliated Americans today are not uniformly nonbelieving or nonpracticing. Many religious “nones” partake in traditional religious practices despite their lack of religious identity, including a solid majority who believe in some kind of higher power or spiritual force. It is also unclear how this may change in the future, and whether connections to these beliefs will weaken if disaffiliation becomes even more common in the broader society. At the same time, many observers have wondered what kinds of spiritual practices, if any, may fill the void left by institutional religion. We plan to continue exploring this question in future research.\nThis report marks the first time Pew Research Center has projected religious composition in the United States under multiple switching scenarios, and the first time that differing rates of religious transmission from parents to children have been taken into account.\nThese population projections were produced as part of the Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures project, which analyzes religious change and its impact on societies around the world. Funding for the Global Religious Futures project comes from The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John Templeton Foundation.\nDoc 4(Title: s held constant here. These additional projections show how the U.S. religious landscape might change if current switching patterns held steady, but intergenerational religious transmission occurred in 100% of cases; there were no fertility differences by religion; there was no switching after age 30; or there was no migration after 2020.) The alternative scenarios are intended to help isolate – and thereby illuminate – the impact of various factors. One might think of the projections as an experiment in which some key drivers of religious composition change are turned on or off, sped up or slowed down, to see how much difference they make. For more information about modeling assumptions and results, see Chapter 2 and the Methodology.\nScenario 1: Steady switching – Christians would lose their majority but would still be the largest U.S. religious group in 2070\nSwitching assumption: Switching into and out of Christianity, other religions and the religiously unaffiliated category (“nones”) continues among young Americans (ages 15 to 29) at the same rates as in recent years. Most significantly, each new generation sees 31% of people who were raised Christian become religiously unaffiliated by the time they reach 30, while 21% of those who grew up with no religion become Christian.\nOutcome: If switching among young Americans continued at recent rates, Christians would decline as a share of the population by a few percentage points per decade, dipping below 50% by 2060. In 2070, 46% of Americans would identify as Christian, making Christianity a plurality – the most common religious identity – but no longer a majority. In this scenario, the share of “nones” would not climb above 41% by 2070.\nScenario 2: Rising disaffiliation with limits – ‘nones’ would be the largest group in 2070 but not a majority\nSwitching assumption: Continuing a recent pattern, switching out of Christianity becomes more common among young Americans as each generation sees a progressively larger share of Christians leave religion by the age of 30. However, brakes are applied to keep Christian retention (the share of people raised as Christians who remain Christian) from falling below about 50%.3 At the same time, switching into Christianity becomes less and less common, also continuing recent trends.\nOutcome: If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up initially but then hold steady, Christians would lose their majority status by 2050, when they would be 47% of the U.S. population (versus 42% for the unaffiliated). In 2070, “nones” would constitute a plurality of 48%, and Christians would account for 39% of Americans.\nScenario 3: Rising disaffiliation without limits – ‘nones’ would form a slim majority in 2070\nSwitching assumption: The share of Christians who disaffiliate by the time they reach 30 continues to rise with each successive generation, and rates of disaffiliation are allowed to continue rising even after Christian retention drops below 50% (i.e., no limit is imposed). As in Scenario 2, switching into Christianity among young Americans becomes less and less common.\nOutcome: If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up throughout the projection period without any brakes, Christians would no longer be a majority by 2045. By 2055, the unaffiliated would make up the largest group (46%), ahead of Christians (43%). In 2070, 52% of Americans would be unaffiliated, while a little more than a third (35%) would be Christian.\nScenario 4: No switching – Christians would retain their majority through 2070\nSwitching assumption: This scenario imagines no person in America has changed or will change their religion after 2020. But even in that hypothetical situation, the religious makeup of the U.S. population would continue to shift gradually, primarily as a result of Christians being older than other groups, on average, and the unaffiliated being younger, with a larger share of their population of childbearing age.\nOutcome: If sw\nDoc 5(Title: e the study’s model – such as war, economic depression, climate crisis, changing immigration patterns or religious innovations – could reverse current religious switching trends, leading to a revival of Christianity in the United States. But there are no current switching patterns in the U.S. that can be factored into the mathematical models to project such a result.) None of these hypothetical scenarios is certain to unfold exactly as modeled, but collectively they demonstrate how much impact switching could have on the overall population’s religious composition within a few decades. The four main scenarios, combined with four alternatives outlined in Chapter 2, show that rates of religious switching in adulthood appear to have a far greater impact on the overall religious composition of the United States than other factors that can drive changes in affiliation over time, such as fertility rates and intergenerational transmission (i.e., how many parents pass their religion to their children).\nThe decline of Christianity and the rise of the “nones” may have complex causes and far-reaching consequences for politics, family life and civil society. However, theories about the root causes of religious change and speculation about its societal impact are not the focus of this report. The main contribution of this study is to analyze recent trends and show how the U.S. religious landscape would shift if they continued.\nThis report focuses on Christians and the religiously unaffiliated, the two most common, very broad religious identities in the United States today. People with all other religious affiliations are combined into an umbrella category that includes Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and a diverse array of smaller groups that together make up about 6% of the U.S. population. In 2015, Pew Research Center projected the growth of several of these groups separately, both in the U.S. and around the world, and the Center may do so again in the future. But, because data on religious switching and intergenerational transmission is less reliable for groups with small sample sizes in surveys, non-Christian groups are not shown separately in this report.\nThe report also does not project change for subgroups of Christians, such as Protestants and Catholics, or for subgroups of “nones,” such as atheists, agnostics and people who describe their religion as “nothing in particular.” For the latest figures on the religious composition of the U.S., including some subgroups, see our 2021 report, “About Three-in-Ten U.S. Adults Are Now Religiously Unaffiliated.”\nScenario assumptions and projection results\nThe four main scenarios presented here vary primarily in their assumptions about the future of religious switching among Americans between the ages of 15 and 29 – which are the years when most religious change happens. Only a modest amount of switching is modeled among older adults.\nFertility and mortality rates are held steady, as are rates of intergenerational transmission. In each scenario, the groups begin with their current profiles in terms of age and gender. Christians, for example, are older than the religiously unaffiliated, on average, and include a higher share of women.\nFinally, the models assume that migration remains constant, which helps explain why non-Christian groups follow the same trajectory in each of the four scenarios. Immigration has an outsized effect on the composition of non-Christian groups in the U.S. because adherents of religions like Islam and Hinduism make up a larger share of new arrivals than they do of the existing U.S. population.\nChapter 2 presents four additional scenarios that explore the impact of the factors held constant here. These additional projections show how the U.S. religious landscape might change if current switching patterns held steady, but intergenerational religious transmission occurred in 100% of cases; there were no fertility differences by religion; there was no switching after age 3\n</information>\n\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that the religious makeup of the United States is expected to undergo significant changes over the next few decades, with Christianity declining and the \"nones\" (those with no religious affiliation) increasing. However, this is modeled under specific scenarios and does not guarantee actual outcomes. There's no clear timeline provided beyond projections indicating changes over the next half-century.\n\nGiven current trends, we can't pinpoint a specific date for when religion will be completely eradicated globally, as it varies widely by region and cultural context. \n\n<answer> 2070 </answer>\n\nThis answer reflects the timeframe suggested by the Pew Research Center scenarios but should be noted as speculative and region-specific.",

An estimated 1.3 million people came to the continent to request asylum,[2] the most in a single year since World War II.[3] They were mostly Syrians,[4] but also included a significant number of people from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Eritrea,[5] and the Balkans.[6] The increase in asylum seekers has been attributed to factors such as the escalation of various wars in the Middle East and ISIL's territorial and military dominance in the region due to the Arab Winter, as well as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt ceasing to accept Syrian asylum seekers.[7]\nThe EU attempted to enact some measures to address the problem,[8] including distributing refugees among member countries, tackling root causes of emigration in the home countries of migrants, and simplifying deportation processes.[9] However, due to a lack of political coordination at the European level, the distribution of countries was unequal, with some countries taking in many more refugees than others. This translated into a humanitarian emergency due to the poor quality of the infrastructure used to manage migration flows. This endangered the safety of migrants deepening the psychological and physical trauma.[10]\nThe initial responses of national governments varied greatly.[9] Many European Union (EU) governments reacted by closing their borders, and most countries refused to take in the arriving refugees. Germany ultimately accepted most of the refugees after the government decided to temporarily suspend its enforcement of the Dublin Regulation. Germany would receive over 440,000 asylum applications (0.5% of the population). Other countries that took in a significant number of refugees include Hungary (174,000; 1.8%), Sweden (156,000; 1.6%) and Austria (88,000; 1.0%).\nThe crisis had significant political consequences in Europe. The influx of migrants caused significant demographic and cultural changes in these countries.[11] As a consequence, some politicians raised concerns about the challenges of integrating migrants, and the public raised discussions about potential effects to European values.[12] Paired also with rising cost of living and other complex social problems, political polarization increased,[13] confidence in the European Union fell,[14] and many countries implemented stricter asylum policies. Right-wing populist parties gained support as immigration became a key political issue and became significantly more popular in many countries. There was an increase in protests regarding immigration and the circulation of the white nationalist conspiracy theory of the Great Replacement.[15]\nTerminology\n[edit]News organisations and academic sources use both migrant crisis and refugee crisis to refer to the 2015 events, sometimes interchangeably. Some argued that the word migrant was pejorative or inaccurate in the context of people fleeing war and persecution because it implies most are emigrating voluntarily rather than being forced to leave their homes.[16][17] The BBC[18] and The Washington Post[19] argued against the stigmatization of the word, contending that it simply refers to anyone moving from one country to another. The Guardian said while it would not advise against using the word outright, \"'refugees', 'displaced people' and 'asylum seekers' ... are more useful and accurate terms than a catch-all label like 'migrants', and we should use them wherever possible.\"[20] Al Jazeera, on the other hand, expressly avoided the term migrant, arguing it was inaccurate and risked \"giving weight to those who want only to see economic migrants\".[17]\nSome have taken issue with the framing of the phenomenon as a \"crisis.\" Political scientist Cas Mudde argued that the term reflects \"more a matter of personal judgment than objective condition,\" writing that \"[t]he EU had the financia\nDoc 2(Title: ult since these vary widely between EU countries.[224]) People from the Western Balkans — most of whom were Romanis, a marginalized ethnic group[225] — were often perceived to be economic migrants.[226] Parts of West Africa and Pakistan also had low recognition rates.[227][228] However, these nationalities made up a relatively small percentage of 2015 arrivals. In 2015, 14% of all first-time asylum requests filed in the EU were by people from the Western Balkans; in 2016 the figure was 5%.[220] Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, whose asylum recognition rates ranged between 60% and 100% in Germany (which accepted by far the largest number of refugees in 2015) together filed around half of all asylum requests in both years.[224]\nSome argue that migrants have been seeking to settle preferentially in national destinations that offer more generous social welfare benefits and host more established Middle Eastern and African immigrant communities. Others argue that migrants are attracted to more tolerant societies with stronger economies, and that the chief motivation for leaving Turkey is that they are not permitted to leave camps or work.[229] A large number of refugees in Turkey have been faced with difficult living circumstances;[230] thus, many refugees arriving in southern Europe continue their journey in attempts to reach northern European countries such as Germany, which are observed as having more prominent outcomes of security.[231] In contrast to Germany, France's popularity eroded in 2015 among migrants seeking asylum after being historically considered a popular final destination for the EU migrants.[232][233]\nInternational reactions\n[edit]In September 2015, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg noted that NATO could play a long-term role stabilizing war-torn countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and in Afghanistan, but that \"immediate measures, border, migrant, the discussion about quotas, so on – [are] civilian issues, addressed by the European Union.\"[234]\nThe Russian Federation released an official statement on 2 September 2015 reporting that the United Nations Security Council was working on a draft resolution to address the European migrant crisis, likely by permitting the inspection of suspected migrant ships.[235]\nThe International Organization for Migration claimed that deaths at sea increased ninefold after the end of Operation Mare Nostrum.[236] Amnesty International condemned European governments for \"negligence towards the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean\" which they say led to an increase in deaths at sea.\nIn April 2015, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch criticised the funding of search and rescue operations. Amnesty International said that the EU was \"turning its back on its responsibilities and clearly threatening thousands of lives\".[237][238]\nAustralian prime minister Tony Abbott said the tragedies were \"worsened by Europe's refusal to learn from its own mistakes and from the efforts of others who have handled similar problems. Destroying the criminal people-smugglers was the centre of gravity of our border control policies, and judicious boat turnbacks was the key.\"[239]\nThen-U.S. President Barack Obama praised Germany for taking a leading role in accepting refugees.[240] During his April 2016 visit to Germany, he praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel for being on \"the right side of history\" with her open-border immigration policy.[241]\nIn a report released in January 2016, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) denounced the EU response to the refugee crisis in 2015 and said that policies of deterrence and chaotic response to the humanitarian needs of those who fled actively worsened the conditions of refugees and migrants and created a \"policy-made humanitarian crisis\". According to MSF, obstacles placed by EU governments included \"not providing any alternative to a deadly sea crossing, erecting razor wire fences, continuously changing administrative and registration procedures, commit\nDoc 3(Title: es around Muslim immigration with a fear that Islam is incompatible with European values.[12] Some national leaders, notably in Slovakia and Hungary, exploited and at times encouraged this fear for electoral gain.[188] A study of ten European countries by Royal Institute of International Affairs found that an average of 55% would support stopping further immigration from Muslims, with support ranging from 40% (Spain) to 70% (Poland).[189] A study by the European Social Survey using more nuanced wording found that 25% were opposed to all Muslim immigration; a further 30% supported permitting only \"some\" Muslim immigration.[190]) The public perception of the migrant crisis from the Hungarian point of view characterized as anti-immigration since 2015. Muslim immigrants are perceived as a symbolic threat to the dominant—mostly Christian—Western culture and [specifically in the Hungarian context] asylum seekers with a Christian background are more welcomed than those with a Muslim background.[191]\nA study released by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights found out that almost 40% of first and second-generation Muslims in Europe surveyed reported discrimination in their daily life.[192]\nBritish Somali poet Warsan Shire's poem 'Home' became a prominent depiction of the refugee experience. A video of Benedict Cumberbatch reciting the poem after a stage performance as part of an impassioned plea to help refugees went viral in September 2015.[193]\nDeath of Alan Kurdi\n[edit]A photo of the body of a 2-year-old Syrian boy named Alan Kurdi (after he drowned on 2 September 2015) became a symbol of the suffering of refugees trying to reach Europe.[194] Unlike many pictures of refugees often published in European media, in which \"asylum-seekers are generally shown in groups of people, often on boats, rather than as single individuals\", the picture was of a single, identifiable child victim and engendered a wave of compassion throughout Europe.[195] Multiple EU leaders addressed the photo and called for EU action to address the crisis.[196][197] Kurdi and his family were Syrian refugees, and 2-year-old Alan died alongside his brother and mother – only his father survived the journey, telling CNN \"everything I was dreaming of is gone. I want to bury my children and sit beside them until I die.\"[197] Kurdi's body was photographed by Turkish journalist Nilüfer Demir.\nPro and anti-immigration protests\n[edit]Pegida, a pan-European far-right political movement founded in 2014 on opposition to immigration from Muslim countries, experienced a resurgence during the refugee crisis, especially in eastern Germany. The movement said that \"Western civilisation could soon come to an end through Islam conquering Europe\".[198] In the United Kingdom, members of the far-right anti-immigration group Britain First organised protest marches.[199] An analysis by Hope not Hate, an anti-racist advocacy group, identified 24 different British groups attempting to whip up mistrust of Muslims and provoke a \"cultural civil war\", including the UK chapter of Pegida and the political party Liberty GB.[200]\nWhite-nationalist conspiracy theories predicting a Muslim takeover of Europe gained wider prominence during and after the refugee crisis.[201] A theory known as Eurabia, which claims that globalist entities led by French and Arab powers are plotting to \"islamise\" and \"arabise\" Europe, was propagated widely in far-right circles.[202] Many groups also circulated a similar conspiracy theory called the \"Great Replacement\".[15]\nOther notable anti-immigration protests in the aftermath of 2015, some of which escalated to riots, included:\n- 16 December 2015: riot in Geldermalsen, The Netherlands, at a town hall meeting to discuss a new housing complex for 1,500 asylum seekers.[203]\n- 25 December 2015: protests by Corsican nationalists, officially in support of Corsican autonomy, but which saw a mob ransack a Muslim prayer hall in Ajaccio and people burn Qurans.

Four countries – Germany, Sweden, Italy and France – received around two-thirds of the EU's asylum applications. Sweden, Hungary and Austria were among the top recipients of EU asylum applications per capita, when adjusted for their own populations, with 8.4 asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants in Sweden, 4.3 in Hungary, and 3.2 in Austria.[26][27] The EU countries that hosted the largest numbers of refugees at the end of 2014 were France (252,000), Germany (217,000), Sweden (142,000) and the United Kingdom (117,000).[28]\nIn 2014, the main countries of origin, accounting for almost half of the asylum seekers, were Syria (20%), Afghanistan (7%), Eritrea (6%), Kosovo (6%) and Albania.[29] Most crossed the Mediterranean Sea from Libya.[30] The overall rate of recognition of asylum applicants was 45 per cent at the first instance and 18 per cent on appeal[31] although there were huge differences between EU states,[32] ranging from Hungary (accepted 9% of applicants) to Sweden (accepted 74%).[31]\nEscaping from conflicts or persecution\n[edit]According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, most of the people who arrived in Europe in 2015 were refugees fleeing war and persecution[33] in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Eritrea: 84% of Mediterranean Sea arrivals in 2015 came from the world's top ten refugee-producing countries.[34] Wars fueling the migrant crisis were the Syrian Civil War, the Iraq War, the War in Afghanistan, the War in Somalia, and the War in Darfur. Refugees from Eritrea, one of the most repressive states in the world, fled from indefinite military conscription and forced labour.[35][36]\nThe major regions of conflict that have resulted in the increase of asylum seekers in the European region are:\nKosovo\n[edit]Migration from Kosovo occurred in phases beginning from the second half of the 20th century. The Kosovo War (February 1998 – June 1999) created a wave. On 19 May 2011, Kosovo established the Ministry of Diaspora. Kosovo also established the Kosovo Diaspora Agency (KDA) to support migrants.\nThe unemployment rate in Kosovo in 2014 was estimated at 30%, a majority of the unemployed being in the age range 15–24.[38] This was reflected in the age range of the emigrants, roughly 50% of whom were youth between the age of 15–24.[39] Detected illegal border crossings to the EU from Kosovo numbered 22,069 in 2014 and 23,793 in 2015.[40] The anti-government protests of 2015 coincided with a surge in migrant numbers.[41]\nSyrian civil war\n[edit]The Syrian civil war began in response to the Arab Spring protests of March 2011, which quickly escalated into a civil uprising. By May 2011, thousands of people had fled the country and the first refugee camps opened in Turkey. In March 2012, the UNHCR appointed a Regional Coordinator for Syrian Refugees, recognising the growing concerns surrounding the crisis.

In the first eight months of FY 2023, 43 percent of admitted refugees were from Africa, 28 percent from the Middle East and South Asia, 13 percent from East Asia, 11 percent from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 4 percent from Europe and Central Asia. In comparison, the leading origins of resettled refugees in FY 2012 was the Middle East and South Asia (52 percent), followed by East Asia (25 percent), Africa (18 percent), Latin America and the Caribbean (4 percent), and Europe and Central Asia (2 percent).\n\n**Figure 2.

They also made up the top three groups in FY 2022, accounting for 57 percent of arrivals (14,500 individuals). Congolese refugees have fled armed conflict that has killed more people over several decades than any war since World War II. In Syria, millions of people have been forced to leave their homes due to the ongoing civil war, facing violence, destruction, and persecution. Similarly, in Myanmar, refugees have been compelled to flee due to factors such as political instability, persecution of the predominantly Muslim Rohingya people, and widespread human rights abuses.\n\n**Table 1.

Closing borders exacerbates the suffering and loss of life.\n\n3. **Stabilization Efforts**: Addressing the root causes of migration (such as war and conflict) requires international cooperation.

An estimated 1.3 million people came to the continent to request asylum,[2] the most in a single year since World War II.[3] They were mostly Syrians,[4] but also included a significant number of people from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Eritrea,[5] and the Balkans.[6] The increase in asylum seekers has been attributed to factors such as the escalation of various wars in the Middle East and ISIL's territorial and military dominance in the region due to the Arab Winter, as well as Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt ceasing to accept Syrian asylum seekers.[7]\nThe EU attempted to enact some measures to address the problem,[8] including distributing refugees among member countries, tackling root causes of emigration in the home countries of migrants, and simplifying deportation processes.[9] However, due to a lack of political coordination at the European level, the distribution of countries was unequal, with some countries taking in many more refugees than others. This translated into a humanitarian emergency due to the poor quality of the infrastructure used to manage migration flows. This endangered the safety of migrants deepening the psychological and physical trauma.[10]\nThe initial responses of national governments varied greatly.[9] Many European Union (EU) governments reacted by closing their borders, and most countries refused to take in the arriving refugees. Germany ultimately accepted most of the refugees after the government decided to temporarily suspend its enforcement of the Dublin Regulation. Germany would receive over 440,000 asylum applications (0.5% of the population). Other countries that took in a significant number of refugees include Hungary (174,000; 1.8%), Sweden (156,000; 1.6%) and Austria (88,000; 1.0%).\nThe crisis had significant political consequences in Europe. The influx of migrants caused significant demographic and cultural changes in these countries.[11] As a consequence, some politicians raised concerns about the challenges of integrating migrants, and the public raised discussions about potential effects to European values.[12] Paired also with rising cost of living and other complex social problems, political polarization increased,[13] confidence in the European Union fell,[14] and many countries implemented stricter asylum policies. Right-wing populist parties gained support as immigration became a key political issue and became significantly more popular in many countries. There was an increase in protests regarding immigration and the circulation of the white nationalist conspiracy theory of the Great Replacement.[15]\nTerminology\n[edit]News organisations and academic sources use both migrant crisis and refugee crisis to refer to the 2015 events, sometimes interchangeably. Some argued that the word migrant was pejorative or inaccurate in the context of people fleeing war and persecution because it implies most are emigrating voluntarily rather than being forced to leave their homes.[16][17] The BBC[18] and The Washington Post[19] argued against the stigmatization of the word, contending that it simply refers to anyone moving from one country to another. The Guardian said while it would not advise against using the word outright, \"'refugees', 'displaced people' and 'asylum seekers' ... are more useful and accurate terms than a catch-all label like 'migrants', and we should use them wherever possible.\"[20] Al Jazeera, on the other hand, expressly avoided the term migrant, arguing it was inaccurate and risked \"giving weight to those who want only to see economic migrants\".[17]\nSome have taken issue with the framing of the phenomenon as a \"crisis.\" Political scientist Cas Mudde argued that the term reflects \"more a matter of personal judgment than objective condition,\" writing that \"[t]he EU had the financia\nDoc 2(Title: ult since these vary widely between EU countries.[224]) People from the Western Balkans — most of whom were Romanis, a marginalized ethnic group[225] — were often perceived to be economic migrants.[226] Parts of West Africa and Pakistan also had low recognition rates.[227][228] However, these nationalities made up a relatively small percentage of 2015 arrivals. In 2015, 14% of all first-time asylum requests filed in the EU were by people from the Western Balkans; in 2016 the figure was 5%.[220] Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, whose asylum recognition rates ranged between 60% and 100% in Germany (which accepted by far the largest number of refugees in 2015) together filed around half of all asylum requests in both years.[224]\nSome argue that migrants have been seeking to settle preferentially in national destinations that offer more generous social welfare benefits and host more established Middle Eastern and African immigrant communities. Others argue that migrants are attracted to more tolerant societies with stronger economies, and that the chief motivation for leaving Turkey is that they are not permitted to leave camps or work.[229] A large number of refugees in Turkey have been faced with difficult living circumstances;[230] thus, many refugees arriving in southern Europe continue their journey in attempts to reach northern European countries such as Germany, which are observed as having more prominent outcomes of security.[231] In contrast to Germany, France's popularity eroded in 2015 among migrants seeking asylum after being historically considered a popular final destination for the EU migrants.[232][233]\nInternational reactions\n[edit]In September 2015, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg noted that NATO could play a long-term role stabilizing war-torn countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and in Afghanistan, but that \"immediate measures, border, migrant, the discussion about quotas, so on – [are] civilian issues, addressed by the European Union.\"[234]\nThe Russian Federation released an official statement on 2 September 2015 reporting that the United Nations Security Council was working on a draft resolution to address the European migrant crisis, likely by permitting the inspection of suspected migrant ships.[235]\nThe International Organization for Migration claimed that deaths at sea increased ninefold after the end of Operation Mare Nostrum.[236] Amnesty International condemned European governments for \"negligence towards the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean\" which they say led to an increase in deaths at sea.\nIn April 2015, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch criticised the funding of search and rescue operations. Amnesty International said that the EU was \"turning its back on its responsibilities and clearly threatening thousands of lives\".[237][238]\nAustralian prime minister Tony Abbott said the tragedies were \"worsened by Europe's refusal to learn from its own mistakes and from the efforts of others who have handled similar problems. Destroying the criminal people-smugglers was the centre of gravity of our border control policies, and judicious boat turnbacks was the key.\"[239]\nThen-U.S. President Barack Obama praised Germany for taking a leading role in accepting refugees.[240] During his April 2016 visit to Germany, he praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel for being on \"the right side of history\" with her open-border immigration policy.[241]\nIn a report released in January 2016, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) denounced the EU response to the refugee crisis in 2015 and said that policies of deterrence and chaotic response to the humanitarian needs of those who fled actively worsened the conditions of refugees and migrants and created a \"policy-made humanitarian crisis\". According to MSF, obstacles placed by EU governments included \"not providing any alternative to a deadly sea crossing, erecting razor wire fences, continuously changing administrative and registration procedures, commit\nDoc 3(Title: es around Muslim immigration with a fear that Islam is incompatible with European values.[12] Some national leaders, notably in Slovakia and Hungary, exploited and at times encouraged this fear for electoral gain.[188] A study of ten European countries by Royal Institute of International Affairs found that an average of 55% would support stopping further immigration from Muslims, with support ranging from 40% (Spain) to 70% (Poland).[189] A study by the European Social Survey using more nuanced wording found that 25% were opposed to all Muslim immigration; a further 30% supported permitting only \"some\" Muslim immigration.[190]) The public perception of the migrant crisis from the Hungarian point of view characterized as anti-immigration since 2015. Muslim immigrants are perceived as a symbolic threat to the dominant—mostly Christian—Western culture and [specifically in the Hungarian context] asylum seekers with a Christian background are more welcomed than those with a Muslim background.[191]\nA study released by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights found out that almost 40% of first and second-generation Muslims in Europe surveyed reported discrimination in their daily life.[192]\nBritish Somali poet Warsan Shire's poem 'Home' became a prominent depiction of the refugee experience. A video of Benedict Cumberbatch reciting the poem after a stage performance as part of an impassioned plea to help refugees went viral in September 2015.[193]\nDeath of Alan Kurdi\n[edit]A photo of the body of a 2-year-old Syrian boy named Alan Kurdi (after he drowned on 2 September 2015) became a symbol of the suffering of refugees trying to reach Europe.[194] Unlike many pictures of refugees often published in European media, in which \"asylum-seekers are generally shown in groups of people, often on boats, rather than as single individuals\", the picture was of a single, identifiable child victim and engendered a wave of compassion throughout Europe.[195] Multiple EU leaders addressed the photo and called for EU action to address the crisis.[196][197] Kurdi and his family were Syrian refugees, and 2-year-old Alan died alongside his brother and mother – only his father survived the journey, telling CNN \"everything I was dreaming of is gone. I want to bury my children and sit beside them until I die.\"[197] Kurdi's body was photographed by Turkish journalist Nilüfer Demir.\nPro and anti-immigration protests\n[edit]Pegida, a pan-European far-right political movement founded in 2014 on opposition to immigration from Muslim countries, experienced a resurgence during the refugee crisis, especially in eastern Germany. The movement said that \"Western civilisation could soon come to an end through Islam conquering Europe\".[198] In the United Kingdom, members of the far-right anti-immigration group Britain First organised protest marches.[199] An analysis by Hope not Hate, an anti-racist advocacy group, identified 24 different British groups attempting to whip up mistrust of Muslims and provoke a \"cultural civil war\", including the UK chapter of Pegida and the political party Liberty GB.[200]\nWhite-nationalist conspiracy theories predicting a Muslim takeover of Europe gained wider prominence during and after the refugee crisis.[201] A theory known as Eurabia, which claims that globalist entities led by French and Arab powers are plotting to \"islamise\" and \"arabise\" Europe, was propagated widely in far-right circles.[202] Many groups also circulated a similar conspiracy theory called the \"Great Replacement\".[15]\nOther notable anti-immigration protests in the aftermath of 2015, some of which escalated to riots, included:\n- 16 December 2015: riot in Geldermalsen, The Netherlands, at a town hall meeting to discuss a new housing complex for 1,500 asylum seekers.[203]\n- 25 December 2015: protests by Corsican nationalists, officially in support of Corsican autonomy, but which saw a mob ransack a Muslim prayer hall in Ajaccio and people burn Qurans.

In the first eight months of FY 2023, 43 percent of admitted refugees were from Africa, 28 percent from the Middle East and South Asia, 13 percent from East Asia, 11 percent from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 4 percent from Europe and Central Asia. In comparison, the leading origins of resettled refugees in FY 2012 was the Middle East and South Asia (52 percent), followed by East Asia (25 percent), Africa (18 percent), Latin America and the Caribbean (4 percent), and Europe and Central Asia (2 percent).\n\n**Figure 2.

They also made up the top three groups in FY 2022, accounting for 57 percent of arrivals (14,500 individuals). Congolese refugees have fled armed conflict that has killed more people over several decades than any war since World War II. In Syria, millions of people have been forced to leave their homes due to the ongoing civil war, facing violence, destruction, and persecution. Similarly, in Myanmar, refugees have been compelled to flee due to factors such as political instability, persecution of the predominantly Muslim Rohingya people, and widespread human rights abuses.\n\n**Table 1.

Four countries – Germany, Sweden, Italy and France – received around two-thirds of the EU's asylum applications. Sweden, Hungary and Austria were among the top recipients of EU asylum applications per capita, when adjusted for their own populations, with 8.4 asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants in Sweden, 4.3 in Hungary, and 3.2 in Austria.[26][27] The EU countries that hosted the largest numbers of refugees at the end of 2014 were France (252,000), Germany (217,000), Sweden (142,000) and the United Kingdom (117,000).[28]\nIn 2014, the main countries of origin, accounting for almost half of the asylum seekers, were Syria (20%), Afghanistan (7%), Eritrea (6%), Kosovo (6%) and Albania.[29] Most crossed the Mediterranean Sea from Libya.[30] The overall rate of recognition of asylum applicants was 45 per cent at the first instance and 18 per cent on appeal[31] although there were huge differences between EU states,[32] ranging from Hungary (accepted 9% of applicants) to Sweden (accepted 74%).[31]\nEscaping from conflicts or persecution\n[edit]According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, most of the people who arrived in Europe in 2015 were refugees fleeing war and persecution[33] in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Eritrea: 84% of Mediterranean Sea arrivals in 2015 came from the world's top ten refugee-producing countries.[34] Wars fueling the migrant crisis were the Syrian Civil War, the Iraq War, the War in Afghanistan, the War in Somalia, and the War in Darfur. Refugees from Eritrea, one of the most repressive states in the world, fled from indefinite military conscription and forced labour.[35][36]\nThe major regions of conflict that have resulted in the increase of asylum seekers in the European region are:\nKosovo\n[edit]Migration from Kosovo occurred in phases beginning from the second half of the 20th century. The Kosovo War (February 1998 – June 1999) created a wave. On 19 May 2011, Kosovo established the Ministry of Diaspora. Kosovo also established the Kosovo Diaspora Agency (KDA) to support migrants.\nThe unemployment rate in Kosovo in 2014 was estimated at 30%, a majority of the unemployed being in the age range 15–24.[38] This was reflected in the age range of the emigrants, roughly 50% of whom were youth between the age of 15–24.[39] Detected illegal border crossings to the EU from Kosovo numbered 22,069 in 2014 and 23,793 in 2015.[40] The anti-government protests of 2015 coincided with a surge in migrant numbers.[41]\nSyrian civil war\n[edit]The Syrian civil war began in response to the Arab Spring protests of March 2011, which quickly escalated into a civil uprising. By May 2011, thousands of people had fled the country and the first refugee camps opened in Turkey.

America’s allies and close friends account for another third or so of the global total, meaning that the Western alliance system wields the preponderance of global military resources even in the context of China’s rise and Russia’s revanchism.) Individual parts of the defense budget are reasonably healthy, too. Military compensation compares well with civilian jobs requiring comparable skills and experience across the bulk of military specialties. Weapons procurement budgets exceed $100 billion a year; the so-called “procurement holiday” of the 1990s and early 2000s is by now completely over.\nResearch and development budgets in 2019 are also robust. Funds for training are proportionate to the size of the force, akin to Reagan-era levels as well in terms of flight hours, steaming days, major ground exercises, and other core activities. The same is true of maintenance budgets. The problem with the latter accounts in recent years has been unpredictability and delay more than inadequate resources.\nBut at the same time, U.S. defense spending is hardly huge or unaffordable. Relative to the size of the economy, it is down to about 3.5 percent of GDP, after having reached nearly 5 percent in the late years of George W. Bush and early years of Obama. During the Cold War, it varied roughly between 5 percent and 10 percent of GDP, by way of comparison. Also, today’s U.S. military is modest in size. Its 1.3 million active-duty uniformed personnel are far fewer than the Cold War force that exceeded 2 million during its latter decades. It is also smaller than China’s and not much bigger than the Indian or North Korean militaries. In short, it is a reasonably expensive but affordable military that relies on sustaining a qualitative edge over adversaries to maintain its combat punch and to protect U.S. interests across the globe.\nU.S. military spending may well be, as President Obama noted in his 2016 State of the Union address, roughly equal to the next eight highest-spending countries combined.1 But defense budgets do not always dictate combat outcomes or ensure effective deterrence. Chinese precision missiles, Russian advanced air defenses, advanced submarines, cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and other such capabilities—whether operated by Beijing and Moscow or sold to other parties—can cause asymmetric, disproportionate effects.2 New technologies offer promise for America’s armed forces, but also new ways for adversaries to challenge or hurt the United States. As such, it is essential for the Department of Defense to have enough resources to pursue a qualitative military advantage over potential adversaries through a robust and well-directed modernization program.\nSo yes, U.S. military spending is large. Indeed, it is now roughly three times that of China’s, the world’s number-two military power—after having been nearly 10 times as great at the turn of the century. That may sound like a comfortable advantage. It is not, especially when the correct strategic goal for the United States military is not primarily to defeat China or Russia in combat but to deter China and Russia in the first place by being able to deny the objectives of any aggression and impose unacceptable costs.\nAs a result of military modernization and reform efforts this century, China now possesses advanced weapons systems including the DF-21 and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles with homing warheads, other precision-strike options that could be used against American and allied bases in the region, quiet submarines that could approach U.S. Seventh Fleet ships undetected, and potent threats against American cyber, space, and communications systems that have previously provided the United States with unalloyed asymmetric advantages.3 Russia, for its part, is in a position to move up\nDoc 2(Title:  the region, quiet submarines that could approach U.S. Seventh Fleet ships undetected, and potent threats against American cyber, space, and communications systems that have previously provided the United States with unalloyed asymmetric advantages.3 Russia, for its part, is in a position to move up to several hundred thousand forces within its own borders quickly, such that they could threaten NATO members Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—at a time when those three Baltic nations combined have aggregate military strength of just some 30,000, and when the United States plus other NATO allies only have about 5,000 troops in the general vicinity under normal peacetime conditions.4) One might ask why the United States should shoulder so much of the burden of deterring Russia and China—shouldn’t our allies do more? While some of America’s allies have stepped up to the plate in terms of defense spending (for example South Korea at about 2.4 percent in 2018, Australia and the U.K. at 2 percent, and France at 2.3 percent of their GDP), many have not kept their military spending levels as high as they had promised, and they have not always spent their resources well. So, without a doubt, the United States must continue to press allies to spend more for their own defense. However, even if allied defense budgets rise, the reality is that there is no substitute for the skill and scale of the U.S. military. Thus, the United States must take a lead role in deterring China and Russia from coercion or aggression.\nFinally, one might ask, isn’t the Department of Defense—a federal agency not even able to audit its own expenses—so wasteful that it can preserve or improve combat power with far fewer budgetary resources? While it is true that DoD is inefficient, much of the waste is marbled into muscle—difficult to excise without painstaking and patient work, lest major combat capabilities be damaged along the way. For example, the military health care enterprise is probably too large and expensive. But access to high-quality health care is a crucial military benefit that helps attract and retain such a high-quality all-volunteer force. And most proposals for health care reform would, once implemented, save at most a few billion dollars a year—important savings, yet modest relative to the overall size of the nation’s military budget and defense needs.\nOr take base closures. After five generally successful rounds of base closures and realignments since the late 1980s, the DoD still has 20 percent more infrastructure than its current force posture requires. More base closures are needed—at least one if not two more rounds. A future round will likely yield eventual savings of $2 billion to $3 billion a year, like the first four rounds.5 That’s real money, but not huge money relative to a $700 billion-plus budget. Also, net savings would not accrue for half a decade. So, like many defense reforms, base closures are more a question of smart long-term planning than a near-term budgetary fix.\nThe Mattis agenda: “Sharpening the American military’s competitive edge” for great-power competition\nThere is much to like about the overall direction that former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis had taken, and Secretary Mark Esper has since sustained, at the Pentagon. Although we have often been critics of Trump administration foreign policy, there is a clarity and cogency to longer-term defense strategy, reflected most vividly in Mattis’ National Defense Strategy of early 2018, entitled “Sharpening the American Military’s Competitive Edge.” That document prioritized great-power competition over the forever wars of the Middle East and South Asia. The shift toward focusing on China’s rise, with economic and diplomatic as well as military tools, had begun in the Obama administration, with the so-called pivot or rebalance to Asia starting in 2011. The changes intensified after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and aggression against eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the promulgati\nDoc 3(Title: Department of Defense Releases the President's Fiscal Year 2024 Defense Budget) \n\n    *   Development of a resilient overhead persistent infrared capability in low earth orbit and medium earth orbit, and continuing to field the Next Generation Polar program.\n    *   Integration of the THAAD Battery capability into the Army's Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System planning process, and continuing development of the eighth THAAD Battery. \n    *   Advanced innovation technologies and demonstrations, including those involving cyber operations and hypersonic strike capabilities.\n    *   Defense of Guam against the missile threat from China - $1.5 billion.\n*   $11.0 billion to deliver a mix of highly lethal precision weapons.

All that said, the Mattis revolution is incomplete at best, and now it appears to be imperiled by a recent shift in political and budgetary winds. President Trump increased the U.S. national defense budget substantially in his first three years in office. But the 2020 national defense budget of $750 billion may well prove to be the peak level of the buildup. It is worth noting that former Secretary Mattis, former Joint Chiefs Chairman General Joseph Dunford, and most recently the independent congressionally-mandated National Defense Strategy Commission had all advocated ongoing real growth of at least 3 percent a year into the indefinite future. Based on Trump administration budget projections and other political realities, they seem unlikely to get their wish.\nThe Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives and the persistent presence of Tea Party Republicans in the Congress do not augur well for large increases in defense spending. After all, a federal budget deficit approaching $1 trillion is a national security concern, too. There is a real threat to long-term economic power and thus national security when publicly held debt approaches the size of GDP, as will likely happen in the 2020s. Given the realities of U.S. domestic politics, it is hard to believe that meaningful deficit reduction will happen without a broad sense of shared national sacrifice. Moreover, a boom-and-bust approach to defense spending results in billions being wasted through inefficiency. Stable and predictable defense budgets help U.S. taxpayers as well as America’s global credibility.\nThe Mattis agenda could suffer serious harm, and the nation could face growing risks, if the defense budget is slashed. Yet never-ending real (inflation-adjusted) growth, while affordable, may be neither necessary nor sensible given the rising U.S. debt. What to do?\nThe path ahead: Quality over quantity, modernization and readiness over force size and force structure\nFortunately, there is a lodestar that Pentagon officials can reference to guide their difficult work—consistent, we believe, with Mattis’ central priorities and with the nation’s strategic needs. Put bluntly, the military should not grow significantly in size, as all of the services currently intend. Prioritization should instead be given to longer-term innovation and modernization, as well as unit-by-unit readiness, of the current force.\nSo far, the one central flaw with much needed boosts in defense spending is the rapidly increasing resources that have allowed the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and defense agencies to have it all. The budgets of the services have not yet demonstrated the clarity and focus of Mattis’ strategic vision. Desires for a larger force have been tacked onto more crucial matters of military innovation, as well as repairs to readiness after two decades of war and one decade of bipartisan budgetary dysfunction in Washington.\nThe Army now wants to grow its active-duty force from some 480,000 soldiers to at least 500,000 and perhaps to 540,000. The Navy wants to increase the size of its fleet from some 285 ships to 355 (in fairness, that goal dates back to the latter Obama years).

The FY 2024 DoD budget request of $842 billion enables the Department to successfully advance these defense and security goals by purposefully aligning resources to best position our warfighters, allies, and partners for success.\n\n**Integrated Deterrence**\n\nThe FY 2024 President's Budget allows the DoD to invest in capabilities that will ensure we maintain a ready, lethal, and combat-credible joint force with a laser focus on China as the Department's pacing challenge and addressing the acute threat posed by Russia. The budget makes critical investments to revitalize the defense industrial base, drive innovation, and take care of our people. The FY 2024 budget request once again includes a record investment in research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E)  of $145 billion. This budget also funds $170 billion for procurement, the largest in history. Combined, these investments will ensure combat-credible forces across all domains.\n\nSecretary Austin has called deterrence the \"cornerstone of defense.\" In FY 2024, the DoD supports the concept of Integrated Deterrence by ensuring combat-credible forces and a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent. Investments across all domains include:\n\n*   $61.1 billion for air power to continue developing, modernizing, and procuring lethal air forces, including a focus on fighters, including F-22, F-35, F-15EX; the B-21 bomber, mobility aircraft, including KC-46A; specialized support aircraft; and unmanned aircraft systems. \n*   $48.1 billion for sea power including new construction of nine battle force fleet ships and continued funding for the incremental construction of Ford class nuclear powered aircraft carriers and Columbia ballistic missile submarines. \n*   $13.9 billion for land power supporting modernization of Army and Marine Corps combat equipment: Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, Amphibious Combat Vehicle, and Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle.\n*   $37.7 billion for Nuclear Enterprise Modernization, including:\n    *   Continued development and procurement of the B-21 program - $5.3 billion. \n    *   Production of the second Columbia ballistic missile submarine - $6.2 billion.\n    *   First year advance procurement funding for the LGM-35A Sentinel program. \n    *   Development efforts supporting nuclear command, control, and communications systems. \n*   $29.8 billion to enhance Missile Defeat and Defense, including:\n    *   Development of the Next Generation Interceptor for Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, and extending the service life of the current interceptor fleet. \n    *   Increased investments in regional missile defense network with Patriot Missiles, a Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor, additional Short-Range Air Defense Battalions, and hypersonic weaponry and defenses.\n    *   Development of a resilient overhead persistent infrared capability in low earth orbit and medium earth orbit, and continuing to field the Next Generation Polar program.\n    *   Integration of the THAAD Battery capability into the Army's Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command Syst\n</information>\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems the United States' military spending is substantial and focused on maintaining a competitive edge against potential adversaries, particularly China and Russia. The military is also heavily invested in modernization and readiness. However, there are concerns regarding inefficiencies and the need for strategic focus rather than just size expansion. Let me check if there are recommendations on whether to increase or decrease spending.\n<search> recommendation on whether the United States should increase or decrease its military spending and global military presence </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: gh as during the “hollow force” years of the late 1970s); attrition rates of those leaving the service before finishing a planned tour are also at historic lows.10) To the extent that there are problems, better management and care of the force can make a big difference. Congress needs to help by providing budgets on time and predictably, avoiding the twin scourges of sequestration and continuing resolutions that deliver resources too late and haphazardly.\nAnd the military services, with support from civilian leadership, need to do things differently too. The Army is overworked partly because it maintains deployments of several thousand soldiers in South Korea and Poland through frequent rotations of multiple units, rather than permanent stationing of individual brigades in these locations (the Mexico border deployment of late adds to the strain). The Air Force could consider similar changes in how it maintains key units in parts of the Middle East. Several fighter squadrons could, for example, be based in Persian Gulf states rather than rotated through them. The Navy still focuses too rigidly on maintaining a permanent presence in the broader Persian Gulf and western Pacific regions. More flexible and unpredictable deployments can ease strain on the force without giving adversaries any solace. The Navy can also consider crew swaps while ships remain at sea, rather than bringing crews and ships home from deployment together every six to eight months, as is now the norm.\nSo, growing the military falls into the “nice to have, but not essential” category. We do not oppose it, so much as argue that if something has to give, plans to increase the size of the military should be that something. Readiness should be fixed primarily by proper, timely resourcing of individual units, equipment maintenance schedules, and the like—as well as timely replacement of aging equipment.\nThis leads directly to the question of modernization, which is absolutely essential for today’s and tomorrow’s force. That is not because the U.S. military is obsolescent. Rather, the pace of innovation in key areas of military technology, and the way in which vulnerabilities in our existing military could be exploited by Russia or China, require it. If we fail to make the U.S. military more modern, resilient, lethal, and survivable, the perception could grow that relative American combat power is fading—or that the American military has developed systemic vulnerabilities that an enemy could exploit to produce catastrophic failure. Deterrence could weaken. War could result. And we could quite credibly even lose such a war.\nThe period of 2020–40 seems likely to see even more change in the technologies and the character of warfare than have recent decades. For the period 2000–20, revolutionary technological change probably occurred only in various aspects of computers and robotics. For the next two decades, those areas will remain fast-moving, and they will be joined by various breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and the use of big data. The battlefield implications in domains such as swarms of robotic systems usable as both sensors and weapons may truly come of age. In addition, progress in laser weapons, reusable rockets, hypersonic missiles, unmanned submarines, biological pathogens, and nanomaterials may wind up being made very fast. The sum total may or may not add up to a revolution, but the potential cannot be dismissed.11\nThe rise of China and the return of Russia supercharge the competition and raise the strategic stakes. The marriage of rapid technological progress with hegemonic change could prove especially potent. The return of great-power competition during an era of rapid progress in science and technology could reward innovators and expose vulnerabilities, much more than has been the case in the 21st century to date.\nSome areas of military technology—most types of sensors, most types of major vehicles, most underlying technologies for nuclear and c\nDoc 2(Title: d Security (but does include Department of Energy nuclear weapons expenses as well as most intelligence accounts and war costs), constitutes nearly 40 percent of global military spending. America’s allies and close friends account for another third or so of the global total, meaning that the Western alliance system wields the preponderance of global military resources even in the context of China’s rise and Russia’s revanchism.) Individual parts of the defense budget are reasonably healthy, too. Military compensation compares well with civilian jobs requiring comparable skills and experience across the bulk of military specialties. Weapons procurement budgets exceed $100 billion a year; the so-called “procurement holiday” of the 1990s and early 2000s is by now completely over.\nResearch and development budgets in 2019 are also robust. Funds for training are proportionate to the size of the force, akin to Reagan-era levels as well in terms of flight hours, steaming days, major ground exercises, and other core activities. The same is true of maintenance budgets. The problem with the latter accounts in recent years has been unpredictability and delay more than inadequate resources.\nBut at the same time, U.S. defense spending is hardly huge or unaffordable. Relative to the size of the economy, it is down to about 3.5 percent of GDP, after having reached nearly 5 percent in the late years of George W. Bush and early years of Obama. During the Cold War, it varied roughly between 5 percent and 10 percent of GDP, by way of comparison. Also, today’s U.S. military is modest in size. Its 1.3 million active-duty uniformed personnel are far fewer than the Cold War force that exceeded 2 million during its latter decades. It is also smaller than China’s and not much bigger than the Indian or North Korean militaries. In short, it is a reasonably expensive but affordable military that relies on sustaining a qualitative edge over adversaries to maintain its combat punch and to protect U.S. interests across the globe.\nU.S. military spending may well be, as President Obama noted in his 2016 State of the Union address, roughly equal to the next eight highest-spending countries combined.1 But defense budgets do not always dictate combat outcomes or ensure effective deterrence. Chinese precision missiles, Russian advanced air defenses, advanced submarines, cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and other such capabilities—whether operated by Beijing and Moscow or sold to other parties—can cause asymmetric, disproportionate effects.2 New technologies offer promise for America’s armed forces, but also new ways for adversaries to challenge or hurt the United States. As such, it is essential for the Department of Defense to have enough resources to pursue a qualitative military advantage over potential adversaries through a robust and well-directed modernization program.\nSo yes, U.S. military spending is large. Indeed, it is now roughly three times that of China’s, the world’s number-two military power—after having been nearly 10 times as great at the turn of the century. That may sound like a comfortable advantage. It is not, especially when the correct strategic goal for the United States military is not primarily to defeat China or Russia in combat but to deter China and Russia in the first place by being able to deny the objectives of any aggression and impose unacceptable costs.\nAs a result of military modernization and reform efforts this century, China now possesses advanced weapons systems including the DF-21 and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles with homing warheads, other precision-strike options that could be used against American and allied bases in the region, quiet submarines that could approach U.S. Seventh Fleet ships undetected, and potent threats against American cyber, space, and communications systems that have previously provided the United States with unalloyed asymmetric advantages.3 Russia, for its part, is in a position to move up\nDoc 3(Title: The Trump administration, with the bipartisan support of Congress, has achieved large increases in defense spending in recent years. The proposed 2020 national defense budget of some $750 billion (as of this writing in November 2019, a final 2020 budget has not been passed by Congress) is much larger than the Cold War average of some $575 billion or President Obama’s last budget of just over $600 billion.) Our view is that after two decades of war, a decade of budgetary irregularities in Washington, and nearly 10 years of gradual decline in the topline, there is no doubt that the Pentagon can make good use of these funds. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ National Defense Strategy sensibly called on the Department of Defense to reinvigorate its capabilities vis-à-vis China and Russia including addressing dangerous vulnerabilities in cyberspace and outer space, while still managing today’s wars in the Middle East as well as the potential for a near-term crisis on the Korean Peninsula. That is a daunting set of tasks.\nWhile we do not doubt that the Pentagon can make good use of a $750 billion national defense budget in 2020, we are very concerned whether it will do so. Each of the services continues to clamor for more force structure: more ships for the Navy, more tactical aircraft squadrons for the Air Force, and more troops for the Army. While growth in some key areas such as unmanned systems, cyber and space resilience, and precision-guided munitions is warranted, it makes no sense under a strategy focused on China and Russia to grow the force overall. The nation’s fiscal plight, with a 2019 federal budget deficit approaching $1 trillion, reinforces the expectation, as evidenced in the Trump administration’s own budget projections for 2021 and beyond, that real defense spending will not grow further and might well shrink. For that reason as well, tough choices are necessary.\nWe argue in this policy brief that the central choice for policymakers and candidates running for election in 2020 is clear. The future focus should be on quality over quantity of military capabilities. Increased military spending largely serves three objectives: better modernization for the future, upgraded unit-by-unit readiness for today, and increased force size and structure. Of these, the last is the least important to the U.S. military for the foreseeable future, and by draining away resources needed elsewhere, increasing force size is actually counter-productive.\nThe U.S. armed forces need to innovate and invest in breakthrough capabilities and to improve immediate readiness, but they can do so at their current overall size. Investing in modernization and readiness rather than growth, paired with more clever and efficient management of the military, can allow today’s U.S. military of roughly 1.3 million active duty troops, just over 900,000 reservists, and almost 750,000 full-time civilians to do the job. By giving up most plans for expansion, the military services can ensure that modernization and readiness get the resources they crucially require.\nBackground: Is U.S. defense spending high or low?\nFirst, some broad perspective is in order. Is today’s American military spending high or low? How one answers this question sets the political and budgetary context for more detailed debates over strategy, modernization, and force structure.\nThe current U.S. national defense budget is certainly large by some measures. It exceeds the Cold War average for the United States of just over $500 billion as expressed in 2020 dollars. The U.S. national defense budget, which does not include budgets for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Homeland Security (but does include Department of Energy nuclear weapons expenses as well as most intelligence accounts and war costs), constitutes nearly 40 percent of global military spending.

I don't particularly like either of them at the moment.\nLudwig will reference this article again when the REAL Cake vs. Ice Cream Splatfest happens.

Ice cream has range – I’d be satisfied with a cold bowl of plain vanilla just as easily as I’d be quenched by a heaping helping of rootin’ tootin’ tutti frutti. And even with all this variety, I have never once seen a flavor of ice cream that didn’t belong scooped on a cone with sprinkles on top. I’m afraid I can’t say the same for frozen yogurt. Too many fro-yo shops are trying to revolutionize their flavors, change up the current standings, out of fear of losing relevance. I’m sorry, but passion orange guava tart? Rocket pop sorbet? Plant based blueberry pancake? Come on, Yogurtland. Do better.) Despite what I’ve said for the past 400 words, I’m not here to disparage the good name of frozen yogurt. In the eagle loving, flag waving, freedom craving spirit America wants to have, everyone has the freedom to like and dislike what they so choose. But there comes a time where we must take a stand against gross accusations that attack the very things we hold dear. Let the record show I abhor the claims my fellow Food Fights co-writer Nina Rao makes against ice cream, and I urge the population to not give in to weekend trips to the frozen yogurt shop simply because society makes you think you must. I cannot in good conscience try to convince you, our dear readers, of anything otherwise.\nMuch like frozen yogurt, the thought leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\nDoc 4(Title: Frozen Yogurt is better – Nina Rao) As the weather winds down from a beautiful, but hot summer to a cool and misty fall, my “Food Fights” co-writer and I sat down and reminisced about the delicious summer treats we had, though Emma’s were universally worse (as usual). Like normal, we got into an argument about which summer treat is better and I’m here to tell you that it’s frozen yogurt 100%.\nStarting with a general palette, frozen yogurt always has a delightful array of flavors for you to choose from. Not to mention, the self-serve function of frozen yogurt stores makes it so you can completely customize your cup. In contrast, the plain uniformity of ice cream leads people to get bored of their dessert midway through and end up giving it to someone else, or worse, throwing it out. I mean, for a dessert that’s supposed to be cooling, ice cream’s plastics sure are warming the earth.\nNot to mention, the aesthetic appeal of frozen yogurt completely wins over ice cream. Frozen yogurt is this wonderful, colorful array of everything you could ever want. It’s beautiful, it’s gorgeous, and it takes you back to that time in your childhood when the world simply seemed brighter. Ice cream, on the other hand, is the equivalent of a retirement home. Boring, mediocre, and with about as much fun as a white person’s grilled chicken. Don’t retire yourself and your creativity, don’t give in to societal expectations of uniformity, and don’t be part of the ford-assembly line type of life that ice cream gives you. Eat froyo.\nFurthermore, frozen yogurt is actually more healthy than ice cream. Healthline even says in a 2020 article that “because of the yogurt base, frozen yogurt is considered a healthier and lower fat dessert than ice cream.” Frozen yogurt will often give you more yogurt for less calories, less fat, and less sugar. Ice cream only gives you less of a will to live. This is just the cherry on top of all the reasons why frozen yogurt is better for summer and for you. Ice cream is nothing more than frozen cow juice and I think we all need to moo-ve on.\nAs high schoolers, we often compartmentalize our feelings and our opportunities. We shove ourselves into boxes to fit in, both socially and academically. Along the way, our sense of creativity and freedom gets lost. But, you can rejuvenate yourself and your childhood dreams with frozen yogurt. Express yourself in flavor combos and topping varieties. So, my dear readers, as the icon Dove Cameron once said, go get yourself some frozen yogurt, “because you only live once.”\nIce Cream is better – Emma Dram\nWhat’s that one phrase? I scream, you scream, we all scream for… frozen yogurt?\nAs many high schoolers can relate to, I have a devastatingly sweet tooth. Coming home from trips to the grocery store with what feels like enough sugar to make Willy Wonka go into cardiac arrest is the closest I’ve ever felt to god. And for those who know me, it’s a trademark of my personality that there is simply one sweet treat to satisfy my craving: ice cream.\nI’m here to say that ice cream is by far superior to any other cold and sugary treat out there, especially frozen yogurt. Dubbed “fro-yo” by those naive enough to support, this dish is not just subpar to the wonders of ice cream, it’s also aggressively average. There are tens, hundreds, thousands of reasons to proclaim in support of ice cream, but I only need convince you with one – variety.\nTo say ice cream has any less diverse of a flavor palette than frozen yogurt is simply inaccurate. You’ve got your classics – vanilla, chocolate, strawberry. Then you’ve got new age contemporaries – cookie dough, peanut butter cup, mint chocolate chip. If you look far enough (i.e. the nearest ice cream shop near you), you’ll even find crazy flavors like birthday cake, cotton candy, and strawberry cheesecake. Ice cream has range – I’d be satisfied with a cold bowl of plain vanilla just as easily as I’d be quenched by a heaping helping of rootin’ tootin’ tutti frutti.

For me, white privilege has turned out to be an elusive and fugitive subject. The pressure to avoid it is great, for in facing it I must give up the myth of meritocracy.

Have you ever\n\nspent a frigid northern Illinois winter without heat or running water? I have. At twelve years old, were you\n\nmaking ramen noodles in a coffee maker with water you fetched from a public bathroom? I was. Have you\n\never lived in a camper year round and used a random relative's apartment as your mailing address? We\n\ndid. Did you attend so many different elementary schools that you can only remember a quarter of their\n\nnames? **Welcome to my childhood.**\n\nSo when that feminist told me I had \"white privilege,\" I told her that my white skin didn't do shit to prevent\n\nme from experiencing poverty. Then, like any good, educated feminist would, she directed me to Peggy\n\nMcIntosh's 1988 now-famous piece, \"White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack.\"\n\nAfter one reads McIntosh's powerful essay, it's impossible to deny that being born with white skin in\n\nAmerica affords people certain unearned privileges in life that people of another skin color simple are not\n\nafforded. For example:\n\n• \"I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race\n\nwidely represented.\"\n\n• \"When I am told about our national heritage or about “civilization,” I am shown that people of my\n\ncolor made it what it is.\"\n\n• \"If a traffic cop pulls me over or if the IRS audits my tax return, I can be sure I haven’t been\n\nsingled out because of my race.\"\n\n• \"I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time.\"\n\nIf you read through the rest of the list, you can see how white people and people of color experience the\n\nworld in two very different ways. BUT LISTEN: This is not said to make white people feel guilty about their\n\nprivilege. It's not your fault you were born with white skin and experience these privileges. BUT, whether\n\nyou realize it or not, you DO benefit from it, and it IS your fault if you don't maintain awareness of that\n\nfact.\n\nI do understand McIntosh's essay may rub some people the wrong way. There are several points on the\n\nlist that I felt spoke more to the author's status as a Middle Class person than a White Person. For\n\nexample:\n\n• \"If I should need to move, I can be pretty sure of renting or purchasing housing in an area, which I\n\ncan afford and in which I would want to live.\"\n\n• \"I can be pretty sure that my neighbors in such a location will be neutral or pleasant to me.\"\n\n• \"I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or\n\nharassed.\"\n\n• \"If I want to, I can be pretty sure of finding a publisher for this piece on white privilege.\"\n\nAnd there are so many more points in the essay where the word \"race\" could be substituted for the word\n\n\"class\" which would ultimately paint a very different picture. That is why I had such a hard time identifying\n\nwith this essay for so long. When I first wrote about White Privilege years ago, I demanded to know why\n\nthis White Woman felt that my experiences were the same as hers when no, my family most certainly\n\ncould not rent housing _\"in an area which we could afford and want to live.\"_\n\nAnd no, I couldn't go shopping without fear in our low income neighborhoods.\n\nThe idea that any ol' white person can find a publisher for a piece is most certainly a symptom of class\n\nprivilege. Having come from a family of people who didn't even graduate high school, who knew not a\n\nsingle academic or intellectual person, it would never occur to me to assume that I could be published. It\n\nis an absolute freak anomaly that I'm in graduate school considering not one person on either side of my\n\nfamily has a college degree.

Those of us who are white have a very hard time seeing that we constantly receive special treatment \\[because of social systems built to prioritize people with white skin\\]. This systemic “white privilege” makes it harder for us to recognize the experiences of people of color as valid and real when they speak of racial profiling, police brutality, discrimination in the workplace, continued segregation in schools, lack of access to housing, and on and on. This is not the experience of most white people, so how can it be true? _Now, we are being shown how limited our vision is._\n\nBecause we have never been on the other side, we largely do not recognize the structural access we enjoy, the trust we think we deserve, the assumption that we always belong and do not have to earn our belonging. All this we take for granted as normal. Only the outsider can spot these attitudes in us. \\[And we are quick to dismiss what is apparent to our neighbors who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color \\[BIPOC\\] from their lived experience.\\]\n\n_Of course, we all belong._ There is no issue of more or less in the eyes of an Infinite God. Yet the ego believes the lie that there isn’t enough to go around and that for me to succeed or win, someone else must lose. And so we’ve greedily supported systems and governments that work to our own advantage at the expense of others, most often people of color or any highly visible difference. The advancement of the white person was too often at the cost of other people not advancing at all. A minor history course should make that rather clear.\n\nI would have never seen my own white privilege if I had not been forced outside of my dominant white culture by travel, by working in the jail, by hearing stories from counselees and, frankly, by making a complete fool of myself in so many social settings—most of which I had the freedom to avoid!\n\nPower \\[and privilege\\] never surrenders without a fight. If your entire life has been to live unquestioned in your position of power—a power that was culturally given to you, but you think you earned—there is almost no way you will give it up without major failure, suffering, humiliation, or defeat. As long as we really want to be on top and would take advantage of any privilege or short cut to get us there, we will never experience true “liberty, equality, fraternity” (revolutionary ideals that endure as mottos for France and Haiti).\n\nIf God operates as me, God operates as “thee” too, and the playing field is utterly leveled forever. Like Jesus, Francis, Clare, and many other humble mystics, we then rush down instead of up. In the act of letting go and choosing to become servants, community can at last be possible. The illusory state of privilege just gets in the way of neighboring and basic human friendship.\n\n**Reference:  \n**Adapted from “Richard Rohr on White Privilege,” interview with Reverend Romal J.

It\n\nis an absolute freak anomaly that I'm in graduate school considering not one person on either side of my\n\nfamily has a college degree. And it took me until my thirties to ever believe that someone from my stock\n\ncould achieve such a thing. Poverty colors nearly everything about your perspective on opportunities for\n\nadvancement in life. Middle class, educated people assume that anyone can achieve their goals if they\n\nwork hard enough. Folks steeped in poverty rarely see a life past working at the gas station, making the\n\nrent on their trailer, and self-medicating with cigarettes and prescription drugs until they die of a heart\n\nattack. (I've just described one whole side of my family and the life I assumed I'd be living before I lucked\n\nout of it.)\n\nI, maybe more than most people, can completely understand why broke white folks get pissed when the\n\nword \"Privilege\" is thrown around. As a child, I was constantly discriminated against because of my\n\npoverty and those wounds still run very deep. But luckily my college education introduced me to a more\n\nnuanced concept of Privilege; the term Intersectionality. The concept of Intersectionality recognizes that\n\npeople can be privileged in some ways and definitely not privileged in others. There are many different\n\ntypes of privilege, not just skin color privilege, that impact the way people can move through the world or\n\nare discriminated against. These are all things you are born into, not things you earned, that afford you\n\nopportunities others may not have. For example:\n\n• **Citizenship** \\- Simply being born in this country affords you certain privileges non-citizens will\n\nnever access.\n\n• **Class** \\- Being born into a financially stable family can help guarantee your health, happiness,\n\nsafety, education, intelligence, and future opportunities.\n\n• **Sexual Orientation** \\- By being born straight, every state in this country affords you privileges that\n\nnon-straight folks have to fight the Supreme Court for.\n\n• **Sex** \\- By being born male, you can assume that you can walk through a parking garage without\n\nworrying you'll be raped and that a defense attorney will then blame it on what you were wearing.\n\n• **Ability** \\- By being born able bodied, you probably don't have to plan your life around handicap\n\naccess, braille, or other special needs.\n\n• **Gender** \\- By being born cisgendered, you aren't worried that the restroom or locker room you use\n\nwill invoke public outrage.\n\n• As you can see, belonging to one or more category of Privilege, especially being a Straight White\n\nMiddle Class Able-Bodied Male, can be like winning a lottery you didn't even know you were\n\nplaying. But this is not to imply that any form of privilege is exactly the same as another or that\n\npeople lacking in one area of privilege understand what it's like to be lacking in other areas. Race\n\ndiscrimination is not equal to Sex Discrimination and so forth.\n\nAnd listen, recognizing Privilege doesn't mean suffering guilt or shame for your lot in life. Nobody's saying\n\nthat Straight White Middle Class Able-Bodied Males don't work hard for what they have. Recognizing\n\nPrivilege simply means being aware that some people have to work much harder just to experience the\n\nthings you take for granted (if they ever can experience them at all.)\n\nI know now that I AM Privileged in many ways. I am Privileged as a natural born white citizen. I am\n\nprivileged as a cis-gendered woman. I am privileged as an able-bodied person. I am privileged that my\n\nfirst language is also our national language, and that I was born with an intellect and ambition that pulled\n\nme out of the poverty I was otherwise destined for. I was privileged to be able to marry my way \"up\" by\n\npartnering with a Privileged middle-class educated male who fully expected me to earn a college degree.\n\nThere are a m\n</information>\n\n\nBased on Peggy McIntosh's list and the context provided, being white does come with a set of unearned privileges in society.

The logic of banning bottled water is that it is a strong commitment to reducing single-use plastic which has high environmental costs. However, others argue it is a rather drastic measure which only tackles small part of the problem.) Reasons to ban bottled water\n- Plastic bottles require oil, water and environmental costs of transporting. This use of oil and plastic contributes to global warming, carbon emissions and is unecessary.\n- Creates unnecessary landfill. Many plastic bottles end up as litter in the sea or the countryside where the plastic doesn’t degrade. This is both a visual eyesore but can cause problems and even death for wildlife.\n- The water footprint of a bottled water is greater than just the water involved. Bottled water requires water in the packaging, production and distribution stage.\n- Banning bottled water will encourage people to choose sustainable alternatives – refillable water.\n- Already airports are providing places to top up water bottles rather than expect people to buy new ones.\nReasons not to ban bottled water\n1. Water has a lower water footprint than other drinks. According to IBWA water has the lowest water footprint of any drink\nIt takes:\n- 1.39 litres to make one litre of bottled water\n- 2.02 litres for one-liter soda.\n- 4 litres of water for one-litre beer\n- 4.74 litres for one-litre wine.\n- 34.5 litres of water for every litre of alcoholic spirits\n2. Encourages less healthy options. If bottled water is banned, but people want to drink they will be forced to choose less healthy options such as sugary and carbonated drinks. The problem of single-use plastic is not reduced, but we just see a rise in demand for other types of bottled drinks.\n3. It takes away people’s choice of whether to buy water. Why should we ban bottled water, but not soda and alcohol which is worse for you?\n4. There are better ways to deal with the problem of single-use plastic. Rather than ban bottled water, it would be better to tackle the wider issue. This could involve an ‘environmental tax’ on all plastic, single-use drinks. This provides a financial incentive to cut back on buying plastic bottles. The revenue raised could be used to fund clean-up operations in the sea and rivers.\n5. Tap water may be unsafe or more likely to contain contaminants. Even in the US, potentially millions of people are drinking unsafe tap water. (Science Mag) One study found that during the Flint water crisis in 2015, nearly 21 million Americans—about 6%—were getting water from systems that violated health standards.\nPersonal view\nFor what it is worth I’d like to give my twopence worth on this topic. But, first, I have to admit my bias and prejudices. The thing is I don’t drink alcohol, I don’t drink soft drinks – I really hate Coke and things like that. I’m vegetarian. I cycle to work. I vote Green (if I ever get round to voting). I get up at 6 am in the morning to meditate. But, I do have one weakness – I really like drinking bottled water.\nSometimes, I like to sip the nicely carbonated San Pelegrino, other times I like to drink the pure still Evian. Sometimes I drink filtered tap water. But, water is the only thing I like to drink. I know it’s a bad habit – But, I’ve tried to kick it without success.\nAnd I’m sure people are right when they say Thames tap water is much better for your health than Evian. (I mean all those nitrates, and chlorine is good for you right ?) And the fact tap water gets recycled seven times means it must be very eco.\nTax Bottled Water\nNow as an economist I’m very fond of Pigouvian taxes. I believe we should have higher taxes on petrol, Fatty foods e.t.c\nIf people think bottled water has negative externalities (pollution, unnecessary landfill) then I’d be happy for an appropriate tax to be placed on bottled water so bad people like me can pay the true social cost.\nBut, if we tax bottled water shouldn’t we tax soft drinks? And is not wate\nDoc 2(Title: foods e.t.c) If people think bottled water has negative externalities (pollution, unnecessary landfill) then I’d be happy for an appropriate tax to be placed on bottled water so bad people like me can pay the true social cost.\nBut, if we tax bottled water shouldn’t we tax soft drinks? And is not water good for you? Maybe we should subsidise bottled water and tax soft drinks to encourage people to drink sugar-free liquid?\nRelated\nDoc 3(Title: eems too extreme, the administration should, at a minimum, post and distribute information telling consumers of the impacts of their choices. Misinformation or lack of information is not an excuse at one of the best universities in the country. However, I think that the best option is simply to ban them. We already have the infrastructure available for individuals to quickly adjust to this change. Free water bottles are distributed regularly and there is no lack of places to fill them. Duke needs to step up, ban the bottle, and end consumer irresponsibility.) \nDoc 4(Title: Should we be able to cause major environmental damage just because it is convenient? Individuals purchasing bottled water seem to think so. In addition to harming our world, water bottles can cause risks to human health, are a waste of money, and are a drain on water and energy sources. Colleges and universities all over the country are recognizing this and as of 2012, more than 90 schools either banned or restricted the sale of plastic water bottles on campus. To continue sustainability efforts, Duke University should take similar action, banning these bottles and encouraging the use of reusable water bottles and existing water fountains and hydration stations.) Despite attempts to encourage recycling, 38 billion water bottles, or 80% of bottles purchased, end up in landfills each and every year. This wouldn’t be so horrifying if it weren’t for the fact that waste from these products never really goes away. The bottles that we get rid of, end up poisoning us. Because most water bottles are made of petroleum-based polyethylene terephthalate (also known as PET), they break down through photodegradation into smaller and smaller pieces instead of biodegrading. This does not frequently happen in landfills since bottles are not likely to be exposed to the sun. However, ten percent of plastic (3.8 billion water bottles annually) ends up in the ocean as a result of trash being deposited in waterways by humans, wind, and heavy rains. Once exposed to sunlight, breakdown of these plastics results in toxic chemicals, including BPA and PS oligomer. These toxins are ingested by ocean animals, which can be ingested by humans and cause serious health risks.\nIn addition to damaging our health and environment, these bottles damage our economy. Would you be willing to pay $1.45 every time you wanted to fill up a water bottle using the faucet in your kitchen? As it turns out, you may be doing that without knowing it. The Natural Resources Defense Council found that 25 percent or more of bottled water is really just tap water. Tap water itself costs only about 0.9 cents per gallon, meaning that when we buy bottled water, we are paying 560 times what that amount of water is worth. As a country experiencing hard economic times, does it make sense for us to be paying this much for a resource that we can get from a faucet for free? Americans spent $11.8 billion on water bottles in 2012 alone. This is $11.8 billion that we are able to put right back in our pockets by making a simple behavioral change. Duke University should play a part in helping us make better economic decisions by having students and faculty take advantage of water fountains and water bottle refilling stations that have already been installed all over campus.\nLastly, the production of water bottles is a huge waste of oil and water. Despite the fact that water bottle companies claim to be a “healthy and eco-friendly choice”, the production of bottled water uses 17 million barrels of oil each year, which is enough to fill a million cars for a year and takes three liters of water just to bottle one liter. When taking into account production and transportation of these bottles in the United States, the Environmental Research Letters journal estimated that 32 to 54 million barrels of oil are used annually, which represents almost a third of our entire country’s energy consumption. This is energy that does not have to be used if we just turn on our tap. As Duke University moves towards becoming carbon neutral, banning water bottles on campus will be an important step.\nOur university needs to recognize and communicate the implications of selling water bottles on campus. If banning water bottles seems too extreme, the administration should, at a minimum, post and distribute information telling consumers of the impacts of their choices. Misinformation or lack of information is not an excuse at one of the best universities in the country. However, I think that the best option is simply to ban \nDoc 5(Title: anitation. [25]) Leslie Davenport, a climate psychology educator, explains that consumers buy into greenwashing unconsciously, because “there can be an unexamined story of ‘I’m doing my part’ because it is more soothing than feeling out of control with the harmful and terrifying trajectory we are on with climate change.” [17]\nAt this point, virtually all claims of plastic recyclability are egregiously false. Greenpeace urges “instead of continuing on this false path, companies in the U.S. and around the world must urgently phase out single-use plastics by replacing their packaging with reuse and refill systems and offering packaging free products.” Bans can assist in this effort. [26]\nCon Arguments\n(Go to Pro Arguments)Con 1: Single-use plastics are sanitary, convenient, and efficient and used in important ways, especially in medicine.\nFrom aiding people with disabilities to keeping food fresh, from reducing transportation emissions to aiding in medical treatment, single-use plastics are much more than “convenient.”\nPeople with disabilities rely on single-use plastics for a variety of reasons. Many cannot lift a cup to their mouth and must rely upon a straw that they cannot easily wash; many cannot manage food preparation and need sliced fruit in a plastic container. Alternatives to single-use plastic can be prohibitively expensive and difficult to maintain for those with disabilities. [28]\nWhy can’t food be packaged in something other than plastic? The simple answer is that plastic keeps food fresh. Emmerson Packaging cites several studies showing that “cucumbers wrapped in plastic last 14 days longer than unwrapped cucumbers; bananas wrapped in plastic last 21 days longer than their unwrapped counterparts; beef wrapped in plastic vacuum packaging with an oxygen barrier film lasts 26 days longer; [and] selling grapes in plastic bags or trays has reduced in-store wastage of grapes by 20 percent.” Keeping food fresh longer not only reduces food waste but also increases the accessibility of healthful foods to “food deserts.” [29]\nFresh food like produce travels an average of 1,500 miles from farm to grocery store. Plastic packaging ensures the food is not damaged during transport and reduces transportation emissions, because it’s lighter than alternatives. [30][31][32][33]\nAdditionally, we rarely think beyond food in terms of single-use plastics. However, single-use plastics are crucial in the medical field, from PPE (masks and surgical gowns) to syringes and blood-transfer bags. Single-use plastics keep patients and providers safe by providing them with tools and drugs that are sterile. We can’t ban all single-use plastic without providing accessible, appropriate, and safe alternatives. [34]\nCon 2: Single-use plastic bans spawn complacency and mask a greater need—a reduction in all plastic production and use.\nThe problem is not consumer use of single-use plastic, but the enormous production of all plastic. Single-use plastic bans mask this larger issue, which poses problems for both our environment and our health.\nEven with every mitigating policy on the consumer side—bans, recycling, and others—“we would still release more than 17 million tons of plastic per year into nature,” according to Melanie Bergmann, a plastic pollution and microplastic expert at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. Bergmann says, “The science is crystal clear. Only upstream measures such as a cap on plastic production will prevent further degradation of our life-supporting ecosystems and allow us at the same time to reduce the carbon footprint of plastics, which makes up 4.5 percent of the global CO₂ emissions.” [35]\nIn perspective, CO₂ emissions from plastic production are expected to outpace the poster child of climate pollution—coal—by 2030. Thus, dealing with single-use plastic waste is only a bandage on the larger problem of plastic production. [35]\nWhile a world without any plastic is farfetched, “it is crucial that the production of new plast\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, both sides present valid points.

In the balanced version, 39 percent approved of Trump’s job performance, while 58 percent disapproved. In the tilted version, 36 percent approved of Trump’s performance and 60 percent disapproved. Two other items also showed a 3-point difference on one of the response options. In the balanced version, 54% said that it was a bigger problem for the country that people did not see racism that was occurring, compared with 57% among the tilted version. Similarly, in the balanced version, 38% said that the U.S. had controlled the coronavirus outbreak “as much as it could have,” compared with 35% who said this in the tilted version. All other questions tested showed smaller differences.) Opinion questions on issues that have been at the core of partisan divisions in U.S. politics tended to be the only ones that showed any difference between the balanced version and the tilted version. Preference for smaller versus bigger government, a fundamental dividing line between the parties, differed by 2 points between the versions. Perceptions of the impact of immigration on the country, a core issue for Donald Trump, also varied by 2 points between the two versions. The belief that human activity contributes “a great deal” to global climate change was 2 points higher in the tilted version. The share of Americans saying that government should do more to help the needy was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version.\nDespite the fact that news audiences are quite polarized politically, there were typically only small differences between the two versions in how many people have been relying on particular sources for news in the aftermath of the presidential election. The share of people who said that CNN had been a major source of news about the presidential election in the period after Election Day was 2 points higher in the tilted version than the balanced version, while the share who cited Fox News as a major source was 1 point higher in the balanced version than the tilted version.\nThe complete set of comparisons among the 48 survey questions are shown in the topline at the end of this report.\nWhy don’t big differences in candidate preference and party affiliation result in big differences in opinions on issues?\nOpinions on issues and government policies are strongly, but not perfectly, correlated with partisanship and candidate preference. A minority of people who support each candidate do not hold views that are consistent with what their candidate or party favors. Among nonvoters, support among partisans for their party’s traditional positions – especially among Republicans – is even weaker. This fact lessens the impact of changing the balance of candidate support and party affiliation in a poll.\nThere’s almost never a one-to-one correspondence between the share of voters for a candidate and the share of people holding a particular opinion that aligns with the opinion of that candidate’s party. Three examples from a summer 2020 survey illustrate the point.\nAsked whether they favor a larger government providing more services or a smaller government providing fewer services, nearly one-fourth of Biden’s supporters (23%) opted for smaller government, a position not usually associated with Democrats or Democratic candidates. On a question about whether the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens American values or strengthens its society, nearly one-third of Trump’s supporters (31%) take the pro-immigrant view, despite the fact that the Trump administration took a number of steps to limit both legal and illegal immigration. And about one-fourth of Trump’s supporters (24%) say that it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, hardly a standard Republican Party position.\nShifting the focus to party affiliation among nonvoters, we see even less fidelity of partisans to issue positions typically associated with those parties.

Trump, 45th president of the United States, based solely on personality dynamics revealed by his political behavior in office.\nPsychodiagnostically relevant data were collected from biographical sources and media reports of Trump’s postinaugural political behavior from January 20, 2017 until July 2020 and synthesized into a personality profile using the Millon Inventory of Diagnostic Criteria (MIDC), which yields 34 normal and maladaptive personality classifications congruent with DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-5.\nThe personality profile yielded by the MIDC was analyzed in accordance with interpretive guidelines provided in the MIDC and Millon Index of Personality Styles manuals. Trump’s primary personality patterns were found to be Ambitious/self-serving (bordering on exploitative), Dominant/controlling (bordering on aggressive), and Outgoing/gregarious (bordering on impulsive), infused with secondary features of the Dauntless/dissenting pattern. There is suggestive, equivocal evidence of incipient Distrusting/suspicious and Erratic/unstable tendencies emerging during Trump’s time in office.\nAmbitious individuals are bold, competitive, and self-assured; they easily assume leadership roles, expect others to recognize their special qualities, and often act as though entitled. Dominant individuals enjoy the power to direct others and to evoke obedience and respect; they are tough and unsentimental and often make effective leaders. Outgoing individuals are dramatic attention‑getters who thrive on being the center of social events, go out of their way to be popular with others, have confidence in their social abilities, tend to be impulsive and undisciplined, and become easily bored — especially when faced with repetitive or mundane tasks. Dauntless individuals tend to flout tradition, dislike following routine, sometimes act impulsively and irresponsibly, and are inclined to elaborate on or shade the truth and skirt the law.\nTrump’s executive leadership style in office has been bold, competitive, and self-assured (i.e., ambitious); tough and directive (i.e., dominant); impulsive and undisciplined (i.e., outgoing); and disruptively tradition-defying, with an inclination to shade the truth and skirt the law (i.e., dauntless).\nComments\nThe research was conducted at the Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics (USPP), a collaborative faculty–student research program in the psychology of politics at St. John’s University and the College of St. Benedict in Collegeville and St. Joseph, Minnesota, directed by Aubrey Immelman, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology, who specializes in the psychological assessment of presidential candidates and world leaders.\nMore information and updates: http://personality-politics.org/donald-trump-2020\nRelated reports\nVideo summary » https://youtu.be/AdlEwKTv8Ec (9:39)\nThe Political Personality of 2016 Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J.

But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.) Obviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voters. She has real shortcomings, like any male or female candidate. They were evident in her failure to put Sanders away early on in the primaries. Her national approval ratings are remarkably low for a presidential nominee, and part of that can be traced to men and women across the political spectrum who have legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton (though her likeability numbers are gendered as well; and of course some women hold subconscious biases towards female candidates, too). White men began abandoning the Democratic Party in the 1960s, for reasons that had nothing to do with gender. The trend accelerated under Ronald Reagan and shows no signs of slowing today.\nStill, social science evidence, primary exit polls and my interviews with researchers and dozens of voters indicate that white men’s attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. “The gender issue, people say it shouldn’t matter anymore,” said Nancy Mills, a member of the Democratic National Committee and longtime powerbroker in Pennsylvania politics. “But it always matters because it exists. You can’t ignore it and make it go away.”\nSocial psychology research tells us that everyone thinks they’re not prejudiced, and everyone is wrong. We all have built-in biases, whether we recognize them or not. I spoke to white men across Pennsylvania and Ohio last month for this story — Democrats and Republicans, old men and young guys, middle class professionals and blue-collar workers. They all insisted that they weren’t sexist. Nevertheless, many said they were uncomfortable with the thought of a female president.\n“Bias in general, whether it’s directed at gender, race, or anything else, is more automatic than people think,” said Susan Fiske, a leading researcher on prejudice and stereotypes who teaches at Princeton University. “And it’s also more ambivalent than we realize. So that makes it harder to detect in ourselves.”\nI should say here that my goal is not to mansplain the way that sexism works to people who already get it. Rather, it’s to work through a thorny issue at the heart of this election that many men, like myself, probably haven’t spent as much time thinking about as we should. We don’t have to if we don’t want to, which is just one of many unfair privileges that come with being a man.\nIt can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You're either racist or you're not. But actually, it's not that simple.\nThe theory of ambivalent sexism, more than anything else, helps illustrate men’s subconscious bias against Clinton, but it’s hard to understand — at least it was for me — because it clashes with many people’s ideas about prejudice. It can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You’re either racist or you’re not. The same thinking applied to gender up until the mid-1990s. That’s when Fiske, working with Peter Glick, a social psychologist at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, published a breakthrough paper that laid out their ambivalent sexism theory. The theory, which has since been accepted by researchers around the world, helped form the basis for how experts study sexism today. Fiske and Glick separated sexism into two distinct categories. The first kind, known as “hostile” sexism, encompasses overtly negative views about women. It’s what we usually associate with gender discrimination. The second kind, known as “benevolent” sexism, describes positive attitudes and actions which men take toward women that are based, deep-down, in feelings of superiority and dominance.\n“Men have ambivalent attitudes toward women that are prejudiced and paternalistic, but that are also based on lo\nDoc 3(Title: freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women ...

What our modern-day two-term presidents can tell us\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were all reelected for vastly different reasons. What matters is that they all won second terms. It's also worth pointing out, as we look to 2020, that they all beat opponents who were not particularly strong candidates.\nOur modern two-term trio also suggests another reality of presidential politics: Even as our politics at the congressional level and in the media reflect severe polarization, volatility and partisanship, it may well be that Americans look to the presidency as a kind of port in the storm, a stable refuge from the uncertainty and chaos of our otherwise dysfunctional politics.\nDespite taking a battering over the years, especially during the 1960s and 1970s, the office of presidency still represents what's left of our affinity and allegiance to national symbols and values embodied in an office and in an individual -- the only elected official whom we can all vote for. Whether it's Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, Bush with his megaphone at Ground Zero or Obama in the wake of the Charleston shootings, we look to our presidents to lead, console, inspire and guide us through trauma and crisis.\nClinton, Bush 43 and Obama were nowhere near achieving undeniable greatness in the presidency. Indeed, they were all flawed and imperfect leaders. Still, when considering a second term, Americans seemed willing to forgive their flaws, favor their strengths over their liabilities and make allowances for their transgressions.\nWhether it's risk-aversion, inertia or any number of rationalizations among voters for not making a change midstream, the last quarter-century has demonstrated a remarkable stability in the presidency.\nSo what does this stability -- unseen for over two centuries -- say about the prospects for a fourth consecutive two-termer? The whole idea of making predictions a year-plus before an election is perilous -- even during ordinary times. And we are not living in anything remotely resembling ordinary times.\nThe power of Trump's incumbency is uncharted territory\nAs an incumbent, Trump carries unprecedented advantages. A strong economy and a nation secure from foreign threats extricating itself from foreign wars adds to that advantage. But what of the idea of the presidency as a source of stability, continuity and unity -- a place of leadership in tune with the best of America's norms and values?\nWhatever their failings -- and there were many, particularly Clinton's behavior with a presidential intern -- Donald Trump's three predecessors saw the office of the presidency as something greater than themselves, a national trust of sorts. They too encountered much of the partisanship and climate of conspiracy that helped fuel Trump's rise. But they never exploited it as a strategy and governing principle; and never departed -- certainly never as egregiously and selfishly as Trump has -- from their role as unifiers and custodians of the values of the office.\nIf the presidency remains a source of comfort and stability, a place of unity and a high ground for Americans despite all that divides them, Trump has brought precisely the opposite to the office: disruption, disrespect and the delegitimization of longstanding values and norms that have defined the presidency's resilience over the years.\nWill Trump become the first fourth-consecutive two-term president in American history? The answer may well depend on whether enough Americans still value the office of the presidency -- and whether they demand from its occupant a respect for the standards and integrity that generations of Americans have come to expect from their presidents.\n</information>\n\n\n\n\n</think>\nThe public perception of Hillary Clinton is more favorable compared to Donald Trump, but there are still challenges she faces.

This level of use may seem impressive but, compared with other countries, it is low (figure). National differences are difficult to interpret. To some they indicate that in the United Kingdom complementary and alternative medicine will grow to match its popularity in Germany or France, where, contrary to the United Kingdom, it is mostly practised by medically trained doctors.\nComplex reasons for popularity\nThe exact reasons for the popularity of complementary and alternative medicine are complex; they change with time and space, they may vary from therapy to therapy, and they are different from one individual to another—for example, a patient with AIDS will have other motives than someone who is “worried well.” Reporting on complementary and alternative medicine in the British daily press is considerably more enthusiastic than that for conventional medicine.15 Also complementary and alternative medicine is largely practised privately. There is an intriguing, positive correlation between signs of affluence and the sales figures of commercial complementary and alternative medicine products.16\nIn essence, therefore, no single determinant of the present popularity of complementary and alternative medicine exists, but there is a broad range of interacting positive and negative motivations. Some of these amount to a biting criticism of our modern healthcare system. Regardless of whether this criticism is valid or not, it is often deeply felt by those who turn towards complementary and alternative medicine, and mainstream medicine would be well advised to consider it seriously.\nMotivations for trying complementary and alternative medicine\nPositive motivations\nPerceived effectiveness\nPerceived safety\nPhilosophical congruence: “Zeitgeist”; spiritual dimension; emphasis on holism; embracing all things natural; active role of patient; explanations intuitively acceptable\nControl over treatment\n“High touch, low tech”\nGood patient/therapist relationship: enough time available; on equal terms; emotional factors; empathy\nNon-invasive nature\nAccessibility\nPleasant therapeutic experience\nAffluence\nNegative motivations\nDissatisfaction with (some aspects of) conventional health care: ineffective for certain conditions; serious adverse effects; poor doctor-patient relationship; insufficient time with doctor; waiting lists; “high tech, low touch”\nRejection of science and technology\nRejection of “the establishment”\nDesperation\nDifficulties in research\nMany providers of complementary and alternative medicine are convinced that their therapy defies the “straightjacket” of reductionist research.

People with cancer may use CAM to) - help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain, and fatigue\n- comfort themselves and ease the worries of cancer treatment and related stress\n- feel that they are doing something to help with their own care\n- try to treat or cure their cancer\nIntegrative medicine is an approach to medical care that combines conventional medicine with CAM practices that have shown through science to be safe and effective. This approach often stresses the patient's preferences, and it attempts to address the mental, physical, and spiritual aspects of health.\nConventional medicine is a system in which health professionals who hold an M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degree treat symptoms and diseases using drugs, radiation, or surgery. It is also practiced by other health professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and therapists. It may also be called allopathic medicine, biomedicine, Western, mainstream, or orthodox medicine. Some conventional medical care practitioners are also practitioners of CAM.\nStandard medical care is treatment that is accepted by medical experts as a proper treatment for a certain type of disease and that is widely used by healthcare professionals. Also called best practice, standard of care, and standard therapy.\nComplementary medicine is used along with standard medical treatment but is not considered by itself to be standard treatment. One example is using acupuncture to help lessen some side effects of cancer treatment. Less research has been done for most types of complementary medicine.\nAlternative medicine is used instead of standard medical treatment. One example is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of cancer drugs that are prescribed by an oncologist. Less research has been done for most types of alternative medicine.\nTypes of Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nScientists learn about CAM therapies every day, but there is still more to learn. This list is meant to be an introduction to what types of CAM are practiced, not an endorsement. Some of the therapies listed below still need more research to prove that they can be helpful. If you have cancer, you should discuss your thoughts about using CAM with your health care provider before using the therapies listed below.\nPeople may use the term \"natural,\" \"holistic,\" \"home remedy,\" or \"Eastern Medicine\" to refer to CAM. However, experts often use five categories to describe it. These are listed below with examples for each.\nMind–body therapies\nThese combine mental focus, breathing, and body movements to help relax the body and mind. Some examples are\n- meditation: focused breathing or repetition of words or phrases to quiet the mind and lessen stressful thoughts and feelings.\n- biofeedback: using special machines, the patient learns how to control certain body functions that are normally out of one's awareness (such as heart rate and blood pressure).\n- hypnosis: a trance-like state in which a person becomes more aware and focused on certain feelings, thoughts, images, sensations or behaviors. A person may feel more calm and open to suggestion in order to aid in healing.\n- yoga: ancient system of practices used to balance the mind and body through stretches and poses, meditation, and controlled breathing\n- tai chi: a form of gentle exercise and meditation that uses slow sets of body movements and controlled breathing\n- imagery: focusing on positive images in the mind, such as imagining scenes, pictures, or experiences to help the body heal\n- creative outlets: interests such as art, music, or dance\nBiologically based practices\nThis type of CAM uses things found in nature. Some examples are\n- vitamins: nutrients the body needs in small amounts to function and stay healthy\n- dietary supplements: products added to the\nDoc 3(Title: Abstract) Background\nComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly included within mainstream integrative healthcare (IHC) services. Health service managers are key stakeholders central to ensuring effective integrative health care services. Yet, little research has specifically investigated the role or perspective of health service managers with regards to integrative health care services under their management. In response, this paper reports findings from an exploratory study focusing exclusively on the perspectives of health service managers of integrative health care services in Australia regarding the role of CAM within their service and the health service managers rational for incorporating CAM into clinical care.\nMethods\nHealth service managers from seven services were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the health service managers. The services addressed trauma and chronic conditions and comprised: five community-based programs including drug and alcohol rehabilitation, refugee mental health and women’s health; and two hospital-based specialist services. The CAM practices included in the services investigated included acupuncture, naturopathy, Western herbal medicine and massage.\nResults\nFindings reveal that the health service managers in this study understand CAM to enhance the holistic capacity of their service by: filling therapeutic gaps in existing healthcare practices; by treating the whole person; and by increasing healthcare choices. Health service managers also identified CAM as addressing therapeutic gaps through the provision of a mind-body approach in psychological trauma and in chronic disease management treatment. Health service managers describe the addition of CAM in their service as enabling patients who would otherwise not be able to afford CAM to gain access to these treatments thereby increasing healthcare choices. Some health service managers expressly align the notion of treating the whole person within a health promotion model and focus on the relevance of diet and lifestyle factors as central to a CAM approach.\nConclusions\nFrom the perspectives of the health service managers, these findings contribute to our understanding around the rationale to include CAM within mainstream health services that deal with psychological trauma and chronic disease. The broader implications of this study can help assist in the development of health service policy on CAM integration in mainstream healthcare services.\nKeywords: Integrative healthcare, Integrative medicine, Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), Health services research, Chronic disease management, Psychological trauma management, Drug and alcohol rehabilitation\nBackground\nComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly included within mainstream integrative healthcare (IHC) services for example [1-4]. To date, much of the focus in integrative health care research has aimed to: ‘identify factors related to successful integration of CAM and conventional medicine’ [5: 33]; to develop theoretical frameworks to explain the various models of integrative health care [5-9]; and to establish guidelines for effective integrative health care practice [10-12]. Significantly, the vast majority of this literature has focused on the perspectives of patients and practitioners, overlooking the role of health service managers in the practice of effective integrative health care [13].\nWithin the integrative health care literature, scholars increasingly report CAM to be popular and/or efficacious for the treatment and management of chronic health conditions [1,14-18]; and especially for the treatment of pain and stress related conditions [19-23]. Burke [24]: 932] argues that CAM may provide ‘potentially more effective multidisciplinary approaches to treating complex, chronic health problems such as HIV, chronic pain, and addiction’.

The lack of evidence plagues large sections of complementary and alternative medicine. For a few treatments, however, our knowledge is sufficiently advanced to allow preliminary risk benefit analyses (see table 1). In some cases (for example, ginkgo biloba for intermittent claudication) the balance is positive8; in other instances (for example, chelation therapy for intermittent claudication) it is negative.5 This underscores the point made earlier: generalisations are not possible, and those who offer them must be listened to with scepticism.\nThe principle of “net benefit” should also include costs. Complementary and alternative medicine is not cheap. Extrapolation from the results of the telephone survey,14 suggests that Britain's annual expenditure is around £1.6 billion, and providers' fees are considerable (table 2).22 But costs must not be viewed in isolation; the real question is whether the use of complementary and alternative medicine increases or decreases overall expenditure in our healthcare system. To answer it, one would require reliable cost evaluation studies. Few such investigations are available to date, the most rigorous of which negate the hypothesis that use of complementary and alternative medicine reduces overall expenditure.23\nTable 2.\nMedian duration varied from 30 min (chiropractic) to 90 min (homoeopathy) for 1st visit and from 15 min (chiropractic) to 60 min (acupuncture) for second visit.\nAssociation with powerful non-specific effects\nIt has been pointed out repeatedly that complementary and alternative medicine can be “ineffective” (in the sense of not being better than a placebo) and still do a world of good to the wellbeing of our patients.24 Some argue that complementary and alternative medicine should be used regardless of the results of placebo controlled clinical trials, particularly when its use is not associated with serious risks (see table 1). In such cases, rigorous research could even be seen as counterproductive. We might, for instance, find little “hard” evidence in favour of aromatherapy; if its “ineffectiveness” became known its availability would decrease, and yet aromatherapy could considerably help patients through its non-specific effects.24\nSuch arguments cannot be used against the rigorous investigation of complementary and alternative medicine. If research really showed that aromatherapy has no adverse effects and helps people through powerful non-specific (placebo) effects, the medical community should start seriously considering the power of placebos. The research question then shifts to how non-specific effects might be optimised so that more patients (not just those seeing an aromatherapist) can profit from them. Even in this (worst case) scenario, research would yield clinically valuable information.\nConclusion\nWe should listen less to the opinions of those who either overtly promote or stubbornly reject complementary and alternative medicine without acceptable evidence. The many patients who use complementary and alternative medicine deserve better. Patients and healthcare providers need to know which forms are safe and effective. Its future should (and hopefully will) be determined by unbiased scientific evaluation.\nAcknowledgments\nThis is an edited version of a presentation at the the Millennium Festival of Medicine in London, 6-10 November 2000.\nBased on a presentation from the Millennium Festival of Medicine\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nReferences\n- 1.Ernst E, Resch KL, Mills S, Hill R, Mitchell A, Willoughby M, et al.

They argue that it is individualised, holistic, intuitive, etc, and call for a “paradigm shift” in research. Usually these arguments are based on a series of misunderstandings, and often the problems can be resolved by clearly defining the research question and subsequently finding the research tool that optimally matches it. If the aim is to test the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine, randomised controlled trials usually provide the least biased method for finding a reliable answer.17) While few obstacles to research exist in principle, there are many in practice. Complementary and alternative medicine lacks both a research tradition and a research infrastructure and therefore fails to attract experienced researchers. Most importantly perhaps, the orthodox attitude remains highly (some would say destructively) sceptical, and as a consequence the funding of research is dismal.18\nOpinion based medicine\nNumerous indicators suggest that complementary and alternative medicine is largely opinion based. In the course of writing a strictly evidence based reference book of complementary and alternative medicine, I extracted all complementary therapies recommended for defined medical conditions in seven recent and seemingly authoritative books on the subject. Subsequently, I contrasted the results with the hard evidence from systematic reviews. More than 100 different complementary therapies were recommended for asthma, while systematic reviews failed to back up a single treatment for this indication.19 There was little agreement between the seven books. For instance, rarely was one treatment for asthma recommended by more than two authors. The exceptions were acupuncture, which was backed by four authors, and homoeopathy, which was backed by six authors. Yet neither of these treatments was supported by acceptable evidence.20,21 Even more surprisingly, less than half of these authors recommended St John's wort for depression, which happens to be of proved effectiveness.7 Opinions that often contradict the existing evidence seem to dominate complementary and alternative medicine, and this highlights the necessity of bringing opinion into line with evidence. The best way to achieve this is through rigorous research and the broad dissemination of its findings.\nHard evidence is scarce\nIf there are no funds there will be no research. If there is no research, we will be unable to find out whether complementary and alternative medicine does more good than harm. Yet this is the central question destined to determine its role in future health care. Simple answers or broad generalisations are not possible. Each of the numerous techniques has to be evaluated separately and on its own merits. Some forms of complementary and alternative medicine are safe but others aren't; some are effective while others may be pure placebos (see table 1).\nIt seems blatantly obvious that only well designed clinical investigations can establish the truth. Those who would prefer to bypass rigorous research—for example, by shifting the discussion towards patients' preference—and hope to integrate unproved treatments into routine health care are unlikely to succeed in the long run. Those who believe that regulation is a substitute for evidence will find that even the most meticulous regulation of nonsense must still result in nonsense. And those who insist that the evidence to support complementary and alternative medicine can legitimately be softer than in mainstream medicine will have to reconsider their position. Double standards in medicine existed for many years; undoubtedly they still exist today, but hopefully their days are numbered.\nThe lack of evidence plagues large sections of complementary and alternative medicine.

It was found that Black men get paid 87 cents for every dollar a white male gets paid. However, it was also found that even as minority men climb up the corporate ladder, they are still getting paid less than white men who are in the same positions and have the same qualifications, the more professionally prepared black men become the smaller the pay gap becomes. To be more specific, Black men who are qualified get paid 98 cents for every dollar a white male gets paid.[41]\nOther issues are contributing to the racial wage gap. These being the opportunity gap and occupational segregation. These issues are influenced by the inability for minorities to have access to the same type of education as the white population, or sometimes to even be able to achieve a higher education. The NWLC found that full time Black women workers are getting paid 60 cents for every dollar a white male is getting paid. It is important to mention that Black women make up about 10% of the low-wage workforce. On average, while a Black full time working women in a high paying job makes about $70,000 yearly, a white male makes $100,000.[42]\nThinkNow research found that even after completing undergraduate and graduate degrees, Black and Hispanics made much less money than white workers with the same, or even less education. Some of the policies that were proposed to confront the racial wage gap were reinforcing employment anti-discrimination laws, providing tax incentives for minority entrepreneurs, performing pay audits, banning the right to ask applicants about their salary history, and upgrading technology to assist during hiring decision to eliminate possible bias.[43]\nWomen and Wage Inequality\n[edit]Minority women have been the backbone of the U.S. economy as workers and caregivers. During COVID, the U.S relied on minority women to provide essential worker services and keep the economy going, however also caused a lot of job losses within the group. Despite this, it has been shown that women of color still earn a lot less than white males and even minority men. This is largely attributed to the undervaluation that is given to work done by women and the many biases that come with that.[44]\nIn a research study conducted by economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, it was found that 62% of the wage gap is attributed to differences in types of industries employed in, differences in hours worked, and differences in years of experiences. However, the other 38% of the wage gap is mostly attributed to discrimination and biases against minority women. Occupational segregation has played a big part in driving minority women towards low-wage jobs such as service jobs like being cashiers, care jobs such as nursing assistants, and domestic work as maids and housekeepers.[44]\nMinority women disproportionately shoulder responsibilities as primary caregivers and breadwinners for their family. Therefore, driving them to accept or choose jobs such as service and care industries that pay a lot less and have a lot less benefits simply because they are jobs that are readily available. These types of jobs are usually able to offer different shifts throughout the night and day, making it more accessible for these minority women to work part time in order to fulfill their obligations as caretakers in their own family, putting them at a financial disadvantage as well.[44]\nPrivate vs. public sector employment\n[edit]The racial wage gap for blacks and whites has been observed to be lower in the public sector than the private sector. In a 2001 analysis, a $3.\nDoc 2(Title: ulfill their obligations as caretakers in their own family, putting them at a financial disadvantage as well.[44]) Private vs. public sector employment\n[edit]The racial wage gap for blacks and whites has been observed to be lower in the public sector than the private sector. In a 2001 analysis, a $3.65 difference per hour was found between blacks and whites in the private sector, a 34 percent difference.[22] In contrast, a smaller difference of $2.85 per hour was found in the public sector, a 21 percent difference.[22] For the 23 percent of blacks that work in the public sector, evidence suggests that wages are based primary on individual qualifications, but for the 77 percent of blacks employed in the private sector, this assertion has not been found to be as valid.[22]\nAdditionally, a larger percentage of the wage gap was found to be accounted for by the human capital characteristics of educational attainment and potential years of experience in the public than private sector.[22] Also, an effect encountered in the private sector in which black males have higher absolute wages as they increase in status but lower wages relative to whites of the same status, has not been found in the public sector.[22]\nPolicy discussion\n[edit]Various solutions to eliminate the racial wage gap have been proposed. Research has identified different wage gaps and sources of wage gaps for different minorities, suggesting that public policies will affect different minorities in different ways and that effective strategies must take into account the unique circumstances of each race group.[16] Sociologist Douglas Massey offers two solutions to alleviate wage inequality: greater investments in education and elimination of racial segregation. He notes that, in a globalized economy, those with only physical labor to offer suffer.[20]\nHe argues that investments in education, especially higher education, will result in higher rates of economic growth and lower income inequality. By eliminating racial segregation, Massey argues that many divides between races that exist would be broken down, including income segregation. To accomplish the abolition of racial segregation, Massey argues, simple enforcement of legislation already in place, such as the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act, is required.[20] For more group-specific policies, focus on education and language inequalities could be helpful in equalizing employment opportunities, but other more specific policies are dependent on further research on wage gaps for various groups.[16]\nTo tackle wage inequality specifically in companies, random job audits at the national, state, and local levels have been suggested. Audits have been used to study and find wage inequality in the past and could be used as way to actively monitor the presence of the racial wage gap in companies.[4] Other policies that could possibly help merge the wage gap are guaranteeing employment and significantly raising the minimum wage. Another factor that should be taken into consideration is Medicare for all. Poor access to healthcare and healthcare outcomes are important because many low-income people can’t have access to it. Many low-income individuals have health issues that prevent them from being part of the working population, therefore putting them at a financial disadvantage. Even if they are able to access healthcare, it ends up destabilizing them financially.[45]\nLimitations and criticisms of the racial wage gap\n[edit]Evaluating and understanding the causes and consequences of the racial wage gap for various races is an important part of understanding racial inequality in the United States; however, the wage gap does not encompass all aspects of inequality and therefore is useful when understood in conjunction with other types of inequalities. For example, sociologists Mary C. Waters and Karl Eschbach note that other types of inequalities are important for a holistic under\nDoc 3(Title: ges: 67.7 percent in 2000, 64.0 percent in 2005, 67.5 percent in 2008, and 64.5 percent in 2009.[18] The absolute difference in black and white wages, however, has decreased over this period.[18]) Black Americans now number 36 million, 12.9% of the total population.[24] As of 2009, the median black male income was $23,738, compared to the median white non-Hispanic male income of $36,785.[18]\nWhile progress in wage inequality for blacks has been made since the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, inequality and discrimination still exist. A study conducted by Major G. Coleman (2003) reports that as black and white men have more similar competitive performance ratings, racial wage differences increase rather than decrease. He also found that black wages are less than white wages in the same industry.[4] When no factors other than race are considered, Coleman predicts the black hourly wage to be $7.49 and the white hourly wage to be $8.92, 19 percent higher than the black hourly wage. When Coleman controlled for human capital, such as education and skills, the difference decreased to 11 percent. Coleman attributed this 11 percent difference to racial discrimination.[4]\nGrodsky and Pager also calculated wage differences, and found blacks to make $3.65 less per hour than whites in the private sector and $2.85 less in the public sector.[22] Using statistical regressions, they found that human capital, region, and marital status account for 55 percent of the wage gap difference. An additional 20 percent of the wage gap was attributed to differences in occupational distributions between blacks and whites. Thus, 25 percent of the wage gap was unaccounted for by their model.[22]\nBlack women experience more wage equality in comparison to white women than black men do to white men. By the mid-1970s, wages for black and white women were almost equal; however, since then, black women's wages have decreased about 10 percent relative to white women's wages.[5] This difference that emerged has been attributed to the increase of white women in the labor force following the mid-1970s.[6]\nIt has been suggested that when more white women began working, the advantages of black women from unmeasured differences in labor force attachment disappeared, revealing a racial wage gap. While an overall wage gap appeared between black and white women, by 1980, the earnings of black women with college degrees surpassed those of white women with college degrees.[6] An understanding of the earnings of black women has recently become recognized as an important area of research due to the role that black women traditionally have in terms of family income: black married couples typically have relied more on women's earnings than other races and the percentage of single-parent, female-maintained families is highest among the black population.[5]\nHispanic\n[edit]The Hispanic minority group in the United States, composed of 50.3 million individuals in 2010,[25] consists of much variance within itself with regard to wages, though all groups' wages are lower than those of non-Hispanic whites.[26] In 2007, the largest Hispanic group, consisting of 29.2 million people, were individuals of Mexican origin, followed by 4.1 million people of Puerto Rican origin and 1.6 million people of Cuban origin.[27] By 2009, the median income of Hispanics was lower than that of Whites and Asians, but much higher than the median wages of African-Americans; $38,039, compared to $32,584 for African-Americans and $49,777 for the general population.[18] While their relative wages have fallen since 1979, this has been attributed to a demand for more educated workers and a gap in educational attainment, supported by the fact that college-educated Hispanic men's relative wages have changed little over time.[5]\nUnlike research findings for the black minority, it has been a converging finding that the largest contributing factor to the wage gap of Hispanics is observable skill characteristics, es\nDoc 4(Title:  occupation. In 1998, the percentages increased to 50% and 70 percent, respectively.[17] Despite this improvement, however, occupational distribution differences still exist between blacks and whites. In 1998, a black male was still more likely than a white male to work in lower-skills jobs and less likely than a white male to work in high-paying jobs.[17]) African Americans’ skin tones become lighter, they tend to experience higher wages. This trend reflects how lighter skin can grant individuals closer access to the privileges associated with whiteness, irrespective of their racial categorization. The author(s) provide a table that states the following: dark-skinned blacks see an hourly wage of $11.72, medium-skinned blacks see an hourly wage of $13.23, and light-skinned blacks see an hourly wage of $14.72 and whites see an hourly wage of $15.94.[19] These statistics challenge the beauty standards that favor lighter skin, implementing anti-discrimination policies and fostering awareness and education about the harmful effects of colorism. This article shows that racism still affects the African American community. From the statistics above, the difference between dark-skinned black wages and white wages is $4.22. $4.22 may seem like a relatively small amount but over time it can accumulate which proceeds to have a substantial impact on financial stability and quality of life. An hourly difference of $4.22, translates to about $8,700 annually. This large amount can cover expenses such as groceries, rent, utilities and even healthcare costs. This significant difference also causes financial stress which can cause anxiety, depression, strain on relationships and so much more.[19]\nGlobalization\n[edit]The globalization of the United States' economy in the 1970s and 1980s caused a shift in the U.S. income distribution.[20] As the United States joined the global market economy, three outcomes occurred. Those who possessed financial and human capital, such as education, succeeded in the new economy because the money and skills they had to offer were in short supply. Those who possessed only labor did not fare well because cheap, physical labor was in oversupply in the global market.[20]\nIn the new globalized economy that formed, much of the United States' manufacturing was exported, which affected most adversely the group of Americans in the lowest section of the education distribution, a section in which minority groups are overrepresented.[6] The increase in overall wage inequality created by the new economy's lower demand for physical labor disproportionately affected minorities as well.[17] The economic restructuring also served to create structural barriers to improvement for those with the least education and skills.[6] Thus, the United States' shift to a globalized economy lead to greater income disparity between education groups, which, because of the uneven distribution of minorities in jobs and an overall increase in wage inequality, led to the wage gap between whites and minorities to increase.\nGeographic distribution\n[edit]The distance between jobs and the location of minorities' homes affects the ability of minorities to find profitable work. Saskia Sassen found that the redistribution of manufacturing jobs out of central cities in the 1980s negatively affected the wage gap between blacks and whites because most blacks live in cities.[6]\nForeign birth\n[edit]According to a study by Gwartney and Long (1978),[16] a person of a minority race that was not born in the United States fares worse than those who are native born in terms of wages.[21][16] The worst affected are men and women from Japan and China and Filipino women. The study found that there is a positive effect on economic outcomes for second generation immigrants, or the children of immigrants who are foreign born, which they believe means that there are specific traits of immigrant parents that are beneficial to the economic success of their children.[16]\nImmigr\nDoc 5(Title: en lower-earning groups, further lowering average wages for such families.[10] Since 1980, studies have found that, conversely, such low earning labor may actually boost the economy as a whole, keeping many corporations and higher level jobs afloat with cheap skilled work, boosting the salaries of native born hispanics and whites alike.[13] As of 2020, black families have a median household income of just over $41,000, whereas white families have a median household income of more than $70,000.[14]) Historically, there have been racial discrepancies not only in earnings from labor, but also in the benefits received voluntarily from employers. Benefits include health care, pensions, holiday and vacation days, among other government mandated and voluntary benefits. Studies done by Tali Kristal and Yinon Cohen show a link between such wage inequality and benefits received, with empirical evidence showing a steady degradation of benefits received for those of different ethnic groups. As of 2015, 32% of workers received benefits—including both mandatory and voluntary—from their employers, up from 28% in 1980. As of 2015, 44% of white employees received pension benefits, compared 36% for black employees and 28% for Hispanic employees. Health care showed similar trends, as the 2015 health coverage rates for white, black, and hispanic employees sit at 60%, 55%, and 46%, respectively.[15]\nCauses\n[edit]Studies of the wage gap for various minority races in the United States have revealed a number of factors that contribute to the differences in wages observed between white Americans and Americans of other races. The factors contributing to the wage gaps for various races and the degree to which they affect each race varies,[16] but many factors are common to most or all races.\nEducational disparities\n[edit]Education, being one of the leading determinants of wage,[17] contributes in a similar manner to the racial wage gap. Varying education levels among races lead to different wages for various racial groups. Education affects wages because it allows access to occupations of higher status that offer greater earnings.[7] Mary C. Waters and Karl Eschbach studied the decrease in the black-white wage gap from the 1940s through the 1970s and found the primary reason for the decrease in the wage gap to be the narrowing of the education gap between blacks and whites.[6]\nOccupational distribution disparities\n[edit]The way in which races are distributed throughout occupations affects the racial wage gap. White and Asian Americans, who have the highest median incomes,[18] are concentrated more in professional, executive, and managerial occupations than blacks, Hispanics, or American Indians.[5][7] Black and Hispanic workers are not only more likely to work in blue-collar or service jobs, but they tend to be concentrated in the lower-wage/skilled jobs, such as operators, fabricators, and laborers, rather than higher-paying precision production and craft jobs within those categories.[5][7]\nOccupational distribution varies for women of various races as well. White and Asian women are more likely to work in managerial and professional occupations, while black, Hispanic, and American Indian Women are more likely to work in service occupations.[5] Thus, because certain races are more likely to have lower-paying jobs, gaps in median incomes between races arise.\nA study conducted by Kenneth Couch and Mary Daly found that the occupational distribution between blacks and white improved between 1970 and the 1990s.[17] In 1968, a black male was only 20 percent as likely to be employed as a manager as a white male and only 40 percent as likely to work in a professional occupation. In 1998, the percentages increased to 50% and 70 percent, respectively.[17] Despite this improvement, however, occupational distribution differences still exist between blacks and whites. In 1998, a black male was still more likely than a white male to work in lower-skills jobs and less\n</information>\n\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that there is a wage gap where blacks are often paid less than whites.

It's the right thing to do.) But a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It's not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this Chamber. [Laughter] For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to retrain. But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build in the process.\nThat's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever. We shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business, you'll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far. And in the process, health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.\nNow, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon, but—[laughter]—a little applause back there. [Laughter] Just a guess. But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security. Say a hard-working American loses his job. We shouldn't just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance, we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That's the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up. And I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children.\nBut there are some areas where—we just have to be honest—it has been difficult to find agreement over the last 7 years. And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the Government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And it's an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make.\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is redtape that needs to be cut. [Applause] There you go! Yes! See? But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else's expense. Middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren't the principal reason wages haven't gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.

And they're doing just that.) A young man, 21 years of age, working at an average salary - his Social Security contribution would, in the open market, buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65. The government promises 127. He could live it up until he's 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than Social Security. Now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis, so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they're due, that the cupboard isn't bare?\nBarry Goldwater thinks we can.\nAt the same time, can't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years? Should we not allow a widow with children to work, and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband? Shouldn't you and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program, which we cannot do? I think we're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds. But I think we're against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, into a compulsory government program, especially when we have such examples, as was announced last week, when France admitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt. They've come to the end of the road.\nIn addition, was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate, planned inflation, so that when you do get your Social Security pension, a dollar will buy a dollar's worth, and not 45 cents worth?\nI think we're for an international organization, where the nations of the world can seek peace. But I think we're against subordinating American interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two-thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the world's population. I think we're against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony, while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the Soviet colonies in the satellite nations.\nI think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs, but we're against doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy, if not socialism, all over the world. We set out to help 19 countries. We're helping 107. We've spent 146 billion dollars. With that money, we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for Haile Selassie. We bought dress suits for Greek undertakers, extra wives for Kenya[n] government officials. We bought a thousand TV sets for a place where they have no electricity. In the last six years, 52 nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold, and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country.\nNo government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. So governments' programs, once launched, never disappear.\nActually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.\nFederal employees - federal employees number two and a half million; and federal, state, and local, one out of six of the nation's work force employed by government. These proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards. How many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant? They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment.

Announcing the legislation, he said, \"If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.\"[190]\nSanders opposed the 2018 United States federal budget proposed by the Trump administration, calling it \"a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs, and for the wealthiest people in this country ... nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1%.\"[191]\nAfter the November 2017 revelations from the Paradise Papers and a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies which says just three people (Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett) own more wealth than the bottom half of the US population, Sanders stated that \"we must end global oligarchy\" and that \"we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent.\"[192]\nOn September 5, 2018, Sanders partnered with Ro Khanna to introduce the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, which would require large corporations to pay for the food stamps and Medicaid benefits that their employees receive, relieving the burden on taxpayers.[193][194]\nVeterans affairs\nOn June 9, 2014, Sanders sponsored the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs in the wake of the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014.

Garbage. Lock her up. Republicans at their national convention are putting Hillary Clinton on mock trial, declaring her guilty and issuing sentences that include death by firing squad, in a remarkable display of political rhetoric gone wild. Even some Clinton haters say the vitriol has gone too far. The focus on Clinton has sometimes upstaged what’s supposed to be a weeklong celebration and promotion of Donald Trump. Instead of extolling the virtues of their nominee, Republicans have turned to increasingly crass slurs against his opponent. One GOP delegate and adviser to Trump on veteran’s issues, Al Baldasaro, took it a step further than the rest. He dubbed her a “piece of garbage” and suggested a punishment for alleged inaction during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks that left four Americans dead. “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” the New Hampshire state lawmaker said in a radio interview Tuesday. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump and his campaign don’t agree with Baldasaro’s comment. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating. On the streets of Cleveland, demeaning buttons for sale say “Life’s a Bitch — Don’t Elect One” and “Trump vs. Tramp.” Others have been even harsher and more vulgar, with crude references to parts of Clinton’s body. Tony Ensminger, a 63-year-old selling buttons outside the arena, insisted “this was mild” compared to what Democrats said about former President George W. Bush. Visceral disdain for Clinton has been palpable all week on the convention floor, where the go-to chant is “Lock her up.” One former GOP presidential candidate, Ben Carson, drew a connection between Clinton and Lucifer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said scandals follow Clinton and her husband “like flies.” It’s no surprise that Republicans are emphasizing Clinton’s weaknesses more than Trump’s strengths. The GOP’s strategy for winning in November rests in part on the hope that voters dislike the Democrat more than the Republican. Fifty-seven percent of Americans in a July Associated Press-GfK poll said they viewed Clinton unfavorably, as did 64 percent of independents who don’t lean toward either party. Slightly more, 63 percent overall, viewed Trump unfavorably; 62 percent of independents. It’s those independents that Trump’s campaign hopes it can peel off — if it can keep up a steady drumbeat of negativity about Clinton. Three-quarters of voters in the poll said their pick for president is motivated by a desire to cast their ballot against either Clinton or Trump. Still, the criticism has triggered a backlash from some Republicans who say it’s beyond the pale. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who’s skipping the GOP convention, tweeted that Republicans “can make the case that she shouldn’t be elected without jumping the shark.” And Bill Pickle, a South Carolina delegate and talk radio host, said those doing the name-calling “sound and act like demons.” “I personally hate — I mean hate — all of the negativity,” Pickle said. “What happened to professionalism, manners and humanity in our politicians and citizens?” But most Republicans seem unperturbed. Wisconsin delegate Jim Geldreich said the stay-on-offense strategy was spot-on. Clinton, meanwhile, has sought to use the negativity to her advantage. She sent out yet another fundraising appeal Wednesday night based on events at the convention, saying, “It’s important to call out what we’re seeing: What’s happening at the convention is not normal and not acceptable.” Does it matter th) \nDoc 2(Title: percent. But giving a non-sexist answer to a pollster is easy enough; the country has almost aced that test. Actually voting for a female presidential candidate has proven to be a much bigger challenge.) Obviously, gender isn't the only factor contributing to Clinton’s struggles with white male voters. She has real shortcomings, like any male or female candidate. They were evident in her failure to put Sanders away early on in the primaries. Her national approval ratings are remarkably low for a presidential nominee, and part of that can be traced to men and women across the political spectrum who have legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton (though her likeability numbers are gendered as well; and of course some women hold subconscious biases towards female candidates, too). White men began abandoning the Democratic Party in the 1960s, for reasons that had nothing to do with gender. The trend accelerated under Ronald Reagan and shows no signs of slowing today.\nStill, social science evidence, primary exit polls and my interviews with researchers and dozens of voters indicate that white men’s attitudes toward Clinton are driven by a complex mix of conscious and subconscious sexism. “The gender issue, people say it shouldn’t matter anymore,” said Nancy Mills, a member of the Democratic National Committee and longtime powerbroker in Pennsylvania politics. “But it always matters because it exists. You can’t ignore it and make it go away.”\nSocial psychology research tells us that everyone thinks they’re not prejudiced, and everyone is wrong. We all have built-in biases, whether we recognize them or not. I spoke to white men across Pennsylvania and Ohio last month for this story — Democrats and Republicans, old men and young guys, middle class professionals and blue-collar workers. They all insisted that they weren’t sexist. Nevertheless, many said they were uncomfortable with the thought of a female president.\n“Bias in general, whether it’s directed at gender, race, or anything else, is more automatic than people think,” said Susan Fiske, a leading researcher on prejudice and stereotypes who teaches at Princeton University. “And it’s also more ambivalent than we realize. So that makes it harder to detect in ourselves.”\nI should say here that my goal is not to mansplain the way that sexism works to people who already get it. Rather, it’s to work through a thorny issue at the heart of this election that many men, like myself, probably haven’t spent as much time thinking about as we should. We don’t have to if we don’t want to, which is just one of many unfair privileges that come with being a man.\nIt can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You're either racist or you're not. But actually, it's not that simple.\nThe theory of ambivalent sexism, more than anything else, helps illustrate men’s subconscious bias against Clinton, but it’s hard to understand — at least it was for me — because it clashes with many people’s ideas about prejudice. It can be easy to think of bias and racism in absolute terms. You’re either racist or you’re not. The same thinking applied to gender up until the mid-1990s. That’s when Fiske, working with Peter Glick, a social psychologist at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, published a breakthrough paper that laid out their ambivalent sexism theory. The theory, which has since been accepted by researchers around the world, helped form the basis for how experts study sexism today. Fiske and Glick separated sexism into two distinct categories. The first kind, known as “hostile” sexism, encompasses overtly negative views about women. It’s what we usually associate with gender discrimination. The second kind, known as “benevolent” sexism, describes positive attitudes and actions which men take toward women that are based, deep-down, in feelings of superiority and dominance.\n“Men have ambivalent attitudes toward women that are prejudiced and paternalistic, but that are also based on lo\nDoc 3(Title: have a grudge against Hillary Clinton\".
